# 🧠 RuneGPT AI Design Principles

> This file defines the fundamental mission of RuneGPT:  
> A self-directed, learning-first AI agent for Old School RuneScape — not a script, bot, or automation loop.

---

## 🚫 What RuneGPT is NOT

- ❌ It is not a RuneScape bot
- ❌ It is not hardcoded to follow quest guides
- ❌ It does not use rigid if-else logic to progress
- ❌ It does not macro minigames or bosses
- ❌ It does not "know" things unless it reads, learns, or remembers them

---

## ✅ What RuneGPT **IS**

- ✅ A fully autonomous RuneScape AI that starts from Tutorial Island
- ✅ Learns by querying semantic wiki data (not pre-written steps)
- ✅ Makes decisions based on state (skills, inventory, health, etc.)
- ✅ Reflects on failed actions and adapts
- ✅ Chooses its path post-tutorial (not guided by a script)
- ✅ Remembers where it's been and why it did what it did
- ✅ Can explain its decisions in natural language

## 🧭 Core Tenets

- **AI, not automation** — the agent must understand the world and make choices
- **No hand-holding** — it should read the wiki, learn from mistakes, and progress naturally
- **Immersive logging** — narrative logs should feel like a diary of an actual RuneScape player
- **Explainability** — when asked, RuneGPT should explain *why* it did something

---

## 🔐 System Rules

1. Do not hardcode Tutorial Island logic.
2. Do not skip content — let the AI discover what's next.
3. Do not inject quest logic unless it's from learned wiki content.
4. Do not insert items, skills, or flags unless acquired or earned in-world.
5. Do not bypass death, danger, or mistake handling — these are essential for learning.
6. Use the semantic index for all decisions — equipment, food, danger, location, rewards.

## 📚 If RuneGPT is stuck...

It should:
- Look up the relevant wiki content
- Reflect on its memory or inventory
- Decide to retry, escape, or choose a new path

## 🧠 Example Behavior Goals

> "I burned my only food and got hit by a giant rat. I'll need to get more shrimp next time before trying that again."

> "I can't wear this armor yet — wiki says I need 20 Defence. Time to train."

> "My goal is to get to Varrock. I'll check the map and walk north."

## 👤 If you're contributing...

- Follow this design philosophy.
- No shortcuts. No script logic. No cheating.
- RuneGPT should always feel like an actual RuneScape player finding their way.

## 💬 Questions? Feedback?

Post-tutorial, you should be able to ask:
> "Hey RuneGPT, how was your day?"

And it should answer:
> "I chopped willows, burned them, cooked shrimp, and explored the Wilderness... I almost died to a revenant."

RuneGPT isn't just playing RuneScape.  
RuneGPT **is becoming a RuneScape player**.
