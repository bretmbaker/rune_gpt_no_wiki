Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Hetty the witch [ edit | edit source ]

Talk to Hetty in her house in south-east Rimmington , and tell her you want to know more about the black arts. She will tell you she is making a potion and needs four ingredients that she wants you to get: a rat's tail , a piece of burnt meat , an eye of newt , and an onion .

Rat's tail [ edit | edit source ]

Kill a level 1 rat (they can be found in the archery shop west of Hetty 's house) to obtain a rat's tail. Note: You can only obtain a rat's tail if you have started the quest! Giant rats will NOT drop a rat's tail.

Burnt meat [ edit | edit source ]

- You can skip this point if you have already obtained Burnt meat .

Kill a giant rat just north of the chapel graveyard south-east of Rimmington , or kill a cow in the cow pen just south of Falador, and cook the meat. Meat can be used on the fireplace in Hetty's own house. If you didn't manage to burn the meat, use the cooked meat on the fire or range to purposely burn it. (A player-lit fire will also work.) You can also buy raw meat from Wydin at the food store in Port Sarim.

Eye of newt [ edit | edit source ]

- You can skip this point if you have already obtained an Eye of newt .

You can buy an eye of newt from the magic shop in Port Sarim for 3 coins . The magic shop is labelled with a fire rune symbol on the map.

Onion [ edit | edit source ]

- You can skip this point if you have already obtained an onion .

Onions can be found in a field directly north of Rimmington and east of Melzar's Maze , or in the backyard of Fred the Farmer 's farmhouse west of the sheep pen in Lumbridge .

Finishing up [ edit | edit source ]

When you have all these items, talk to Hetty . She'll put them in her cauldron and tell you to drink from it. Drink from the cauldron to complete the quest and gain your reward.

Congratulations, quest complete!
