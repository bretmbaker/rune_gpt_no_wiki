Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl is a miniquest that is required to be completed in order to gain access to the Horror from the Deep and Scorpion Catcher quests , and access to the Barbarian Outpost Agility Course , where it is considered a "rite of passage". To complete it, you must trek around various bars and pubs in Old School RuneScape , drinking a specialty drink, having them sign off a supplied Barcrawl card . The miniquest is notable for granting the ability to automatically smash vials on drinking the last dose of a potion.

Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Starting out [ edit | edit source ]

To begin, talk to one of the barbarian guards outside the Agility training area at the Barbarian Outpost (Games necklace) to get the Barcrawl card . If your inventory is full, the guard will make no mention of the miniquest and you will not receive the card . While doing the bar crawl, you'll be given a card with a list of all the bars you have to visit. Each one will be checked off when you've found it and drunk the specific brew required. If you lose the card, you'll have to start the entire miniquest all over again.

You'll need to tell the barkeepers that you're doing the Alfred Grimhand Barcrawl and they will give you what you need. The brews are very strong, though, causing some damage as well as some steep temporary drops in stats. The entire trip will cost around 230 coins, plus money for runes / tablets and boat trips to Karamja . Once you have every line of the card signed, return it to one of the guards at the Barbarian Outpost.

Visiting the bars [ edit | edit source ]

You can visit the bars in any order. The amount of damage dealt by the damaging drinks is dependent on your Hitpoints level. For the possible routes, check out the section after the table below. Note that a very cost efficient way to get around is by going on to a house party world (World 330 for example) to use the teleports and the jewellery boxes provided by the hosts.

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

After completing all bar crawl locations, you will be unable to read the bar crawl card as you will be "too drunk." After drinking in Brimhaven, it says you think you see two bartenders signing two barcrawl cards. After drinking at the Falador pub, your screen will sway slightly to indicate you are drunk. None of the drinks appear in a player's inventory but are drunk automatically. After you hand the bar crawl card to the guard, he says that he never learned to read, he just sees you are plenty drunk and lets you go to the agility course. It is possible to redo the miniquest by drop-tricking to make a duplicate and, before completing the quest, dropping it again. To start it again, the player must go to one of the bars; however, they will be unable to enter the agility course until they complete it again. Alfred Grimhand makes an appearance as a barbarian bartender in the 2022 Christmas event . Alfred was the first to successfully accomplish this barcrawl, [1] though he tells players that it was originally a prank for new recruits. [2]
