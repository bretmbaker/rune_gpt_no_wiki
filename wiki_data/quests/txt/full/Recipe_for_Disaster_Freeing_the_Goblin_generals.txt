Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Items required: Bread , an orange , a knife , dye (other than red, yellow, orange, or pink), spice , fishing bait , a bucket of water , and charcoal .

First, inspect the frozen goblin statues in Lumbridge Castle to start the quest.

Go to the Goblin Village , enter the building just south of the generals and climb down the ladder. You will see Mudknuckles , a goblin cook. He will tell you to get him some charcoal to finish a cooking recipe that he overheard two dwarves talking about. Give him the charcoal. He will add it to his cauldron, which will explode in a hilarious cutscene. Miraculously, you both survive.

Mudknuckles will then tell you that he has trouble with the food, as both the generals are bickering over it. To make food for the generals, he needs oranges that aren't orange, maggots that aren't bland, and bread that isn't crunchy. You can make the ingredients listed below:

Dyed orange - Use the dye on some orange slices . Spicy maggots - Use the spice on the fishing bait . Soggy bread - Use a bucket of water on some bread .

Give all three to Mudknuckles to get the Slop of compromise . Give it to the goblin generals in Lumbridge to complete this part of the quest.
