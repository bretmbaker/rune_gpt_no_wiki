Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Getting started [ edit | edit source ]

Head to the small village of Tai Bwo Wannai , south of Brimhaven on Karamja . (A charter ship can be used to get to Brimhaven).

Talk to Trufitus , found in a small house north-east of the main village area. Ask him where everyone is, and he says that they've left the village.

Ask him about how you can help, and he tells you that he needs several herbs to mix a potion so that he can commune with the Gods. Tell him that you'll give it a try.

Snake Weed [ edit | edit source ]

The first herb is called snake weed .

Head south-west of the village near the ocean and find marshy jungle vine . Search it to get a grimy snake weed (might take 1–5 minutes, with increased speed with higher Herblore ). Clean the herb and give it to Trufitus .

Ardrigal [ edit | edit source ]

Head north-east of Trufitus ' hut until you reach a peninsula with several palm trees on it (just south of an agility shortcut ).

Search a palm tree to find a grimy ardrigal . Clean the herb and give it to Trufitus .

Level 46 Harpie Bug Swarms will attack you the entire time you're searching for the herb and can easily kill an unwary lower levelled player.

Sito Foil [ edit | edit source ]

Go south-west to the middle of the village, and on the western side, and just north of the westernmost table should be a patch of scorched earth . Search it to find the grimy sito foil . Clean the herb and give it to Trufitus .

Warning : Tribesman are aggressive, They can poison you with damage starting at 11.

Volencia Moss [ edit | edit source ]

Head south-east of the hut until you reach a group of rocks you can search that are in the mining area, search an empty one to find the grimy volencia moss . Clean the herb and give it to Trufitus .

Rogue's Purse [ edit | edit source ]

Rogue's purse can be found north of the village. Head north-east towards where you found the Ardrigal. Once you find the end of the cliffs, follow the coastline west until you find a pile of searchable rocks . Search them and enter the cave.

Note: (optional) Bring a spade to about 13-16 tiles north-west of cave entrance (before entering cave) and dig around for the Clue hunter trousers , and equipment to kill a Jogre inside the dungeon for the Karamja Easy Diary , and to obtain Jogre bones for Tai Bwo Wannai Trio . The Jogres can also drop the grimy rogue's purse , however Trufitus will not accept it.

Once inside the cave, run south past the level 53 Jogres until you find a Fungus covered Cavern wall . Search it until you find the grimy rogue's purse (may take some minutes). Consider collecting an extra rogue's purse if you plan on completing Zogre Flesh Eaters to save the extra trip.

Return to Trufitus with the final cleaned herb.

Congratulations, quest complete!
