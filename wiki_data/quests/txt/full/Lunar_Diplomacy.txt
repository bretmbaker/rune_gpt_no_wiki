Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

To begin the quest, talk to Lokar Searunner on the westernmost dock of Rellekka.

Note: You must keep your Seal of passage , once obtained, on you at all times while on the Lunar Isle . If you do not, you will be teleported off of the isle if you try to talk to any NPC , including when banking.
The lantern given during the quest does not come with oil in it, so bring a lightable regular bullseye lantern . If you put the emerald lens in the given lantern, drop it and ask for a new lens, which you then use on your working brought bullseye lantern.

Part 1 - The Ship [ edit | edit source ]

Note: If you have a bullseye lantern (unf) in your bank, you will have to bring it with you, or else Cabin Boy will not give you one.

Take your tinderbox , your choice of transport to Rellekka , and talk to Lokar Searunner on the westernmost dock of Rellekka. He will tell you about the Moon Clan . Talk to Brundt the Chieftain in the longhall, and get a seal of passage . Keep it with you at all times when you're on the Lunar Isle or any related areas , or else you'll get teleported back to Rellekka, even when the quest is over. Note: If you lose or destroy the seal and have a placeholder for it in your bank, Brundt won't give you a replacement until you remove the placeholder. Talk to Lokar again to sail to the Pirates' Cove . Climb the ladder on the dock you arrive at in order to board the Lady Zay . Talk to Captain Bentley on the ship and ask him to sail you to the Lunar Islands. The ship will proceed to only sail around the island in a circle, befuddling the captain. Talk to the Captain again. Note: You and the captain must be on the boat and not the docks in order for the story to progress. Talk to the navigator 'Birds-Eye' Jack , found at the rear of the lower deck. Talk to the captain again to ask what happened, and suggest it was the navigator's fault. Talk to the navigator again — he will mention a jinx being put on the ship. Talk to the captain, and he will tell you to talk to members of the crew for help. You must talk to them in the sequence below. Talk to 'Eagle-eye' Shultz , located on the same deck as the captain at the far northern end of the ship. He will tell you about jinxes. Talk to the Cabin Boy up one deck from the captain (south). Talk to 'Beefy' Burns on the lowest most deck (go down two decks to where the navigator is. Then, go north and climb down the stairs and south to the galley (kitchen) area to find him). Talk to 'Lecherous' Lee next to the cabin boy on the uppermost deck. Talk to First mate 'Davey-boy' (same deck as the captain). Talk to the cabin boy, who will now confess to placing the jinx. ( Make sure you have two empty inventory spaces. ) You should now have received an emerald lantern lens and an unfinished lantern (if the cabin boy didn't give an unfinished lantern, one may be in your bank) Use the lens on the working lantern you brought, not the bullseye lantern (unf) the cabin boy gave (if you accidentally use it on the unfinished lantern, drop it and talk to the cabin boy to receive another emerald lens), to get an emerald lantern . Use a tinderbox on the lantern to light it. If you couldn't bring a functional bullseye lantern, you will have to fuel the lantern yourself by doing the following: Pick up swamp tar from a tar barrel. You can find one in 'Birds-Eye' Jack 's room. Another one is located on the dock, right next to the gangway. Head to the still inside the Chemist's House in Rimmington . Use your swamp tar on it. Combine the emerald lens with the lantern the cabin boy gave, and use the emerald lantern on the lamp oil still to fill it with lamp oil.

Next, you need to find five symbols and wipe them all away. The seals are on the following locations (use your lantern on the object to reveal the symbol): Big and metal: The eastern cannon by the cabin boy (if this didn't work, try the other cannon). Wallchart: Same floor as Captain, towards the rear of the ship in the First Mate's cabin. Use your lantern on the north-western wallchart. Chest: Northern Chest on the lowest deck, near the stairs. Crate: Two stacked crates on the lowest deck, near the cook. Support column: Support column on the lowest deck, near the cook.

When all the seals are wiped, talk to the captain again, and sail to Moonclan Island !

Part 2 - Moonclan Island [ edit | edit source ]

Make sure to keep your seal of passage in your inventory at all times!

Be cautious of the aggressive level 111 Suqah while on Lunar Isle, especially the north side of the island, which features Suqah that can use dangerous magic attacks as well as melee. There is a bank and a general store on Moonclan Island , so you can get items here.

Find Meteora in the village; she is on the south-western side of the village by the wall. She will tell you that although they don't have a leader, the Oneiromancer will be able to help you more than anyone. Walk to the south-eastern part of the island, and find the Oneiromancer (near the Astral Altar ), who tells you that you will need three things (which must be done in the following sequence).

Talk to Baba Yaga in the chicken house in the village (north of the bank in the fenced area — it walks like a chicken). She will give you a special potion bottle, and tell you that you need a guam leaf , marrentill and a crushed Suqah tooth .

First, fill the empty vial from a nearby water source (using a bucket of water does not work); then travel to the south-east again, and kill a Suqah (level 111). Suqah can be safespotted using the tree on the path to the Oneiromancer . The tooth does not drop every time, but it's fairly common. Make sure to also pick up their hides , as you will need four of them later on (note that you do not need to get all four hides now, as you will be killing more Suqah to obtain the amulet later). They also drop guam and marrentill herbs. Once you have a tooth, add the guam leaf and marrentill to the vial, and then crush the Suqah tooth with the pestle and mortar to get a ground tooth . Add the ground tooth to the vial and then talk to the Oneiromancer again to give her the potion.

Talk to the Oneiromancer to give her the potion before starting the staff. You won't be able to make lunar staves after this next part (and must pay 30,000 coins for more), so it is advisable to make more than one. Take your dramen staff (or staves) to all four elemental altars in this order: Air, Fire, Water and Earth . Once there, 'use' the staff on each of the four altars.

The air altar is located in the mysterious ruins south of Falador. The quickest method to reach it is to teleport to the Crafting Guild via a skills necklace then run east, alternatively teleporting to Falador and running south-west from the southern gates. The fire altar is located in the mysterious ruins north-east of Al Kharid. The quickest method to reach it is to teleport to Emir's Arena via a ring of dueling then run north, alternatively, running east from Lumbridge or north-east from the gnome glider . The water altar is located in the mysterious ruins south-west of Lumbridge. The quickest method to reach it is by using a Fairy Ring to enter Zanaris then exiting via the ring next to the chicken shrine and running west to the altar from the shack; alternatively teleporting to Lumbridge and running south-west from the graveyard exit or teleporting to the Wizard's Tower via a necklace of passage and running east. The earth altar is located in the mysterious ruins north-east of Varrock, just south-east of the lumberyard. The quickest method to reach it is to use a lumberyard teleport and run south-east, alternatively teleporting to Varrock and running north-east or teleporting to the Digsite and running north-west.

The lunar staff or staves you create will change names depending on which step you are currently on in enchanting it. Only enchanting it with the air element labels the staff 'Lunar staff pt 1', with air and fire 'Lunar staff pt 2' and so on and so forth. After the fourth enchantment of earth, it becomes a lunar staff that you are unable to equip until you are able to wear clothes of the Moon Clan .

If you want to have more than one lunar staff, turn all of the dramen staves into lunar staves BEFORE turning in one of your lunar staves to the Oneiromancer for the quest.

If using fairy rings to transport yourself, bring one regular dramen staff with you to use for fairy rings, as you will be unable to equip the Lunar Staff after you make them. However, once you give a lunar staff to the Oneiromancer, any extra you previously made will become equipable AND can be used to access fairy rings.

Take the staff to the Oneiromancer to proceed. The Oneiromancer will keep one of your lunar staves until you have made a set of lunar clothing.

These consist of eight different items:

Helm - Take your pickaxe and hammer , and travel north-east of the island, and you should find a dungeon. You must run past some Suqah , which may cast Ice Barrage , to reach it. Once inside, mine any stalagmite to get some lunar ore . Only one lunar ore is needed to craft the Helm , but if you plan to do The Fremennik Exiles later, you can save some time by getting three additional ores now. There is a furnace and anvil in Rellekka where you can smith the helm. You can return to Rellekka quickly by destroying the Seal of passage , and speaking to any of the lunar citizens. (Remember to speak to Brundt for another seal, before you return to the island.) Cape - Talk to Pauline Polaris to the north-western side of the village. You have to guess her name; first guess Pauline and then after receiving a clue, choose Jane Blud-Hagic-Maid. Amulet - Talk to Meteora in south part of the village. She'll tell you that she'll swap her amulet for her tiara that she lost to one of the Suqah. Kill Suqah to get it back (it can take five or more Suqah kills to get the tiara) and keep the hides until you have four (you will need them for the next step), and then exchange the tiara for the amulet. Torso , Gloves , Boots and Legs - Speak to Rimae Sirsalis at the clothes shop; she will tell you that she can tan Suqah hides for 100 coins each. Collect four Suqah hides if you haven't already, get them tanned, and with some thread , use a needle on the Suqah leather to make the four items. (She sells needles and thread.)

Ring - Speak to Selene near the centre of the village; she will give you a riddle. Take a spade , and travel round outside the southern side of the village to the west until you come to a bridge. Dig on the blue flowers to the very south-west of the island, as shown in the picture. Make sure you complete the dialogue or else you will not receive the ring.

Take all items back to the Oneiromancer , and she will give you all your obtained items back (make sure you have 11 free inventory spots) plus some kindling that was obtained from the first ever magic tree and a waking sleep vial .

Part 3 - Dream World [ edit | edit source ]

Note: you cannot use any other combat equipment (including staves, armour and potions) in the Dream World .  However godbooks and the Tome of Fire are allowed.

Head to the bank and stock up. Do not bank the seal of passage or you will not be able to use the bank again and will have to go get it from another bank. At level 65 Magic, runes for about 40 casts of Fire Bolt will be enough.
Enter the long building on the western side of the village that has a ceremonial brazier and a staircase inside. Equip all of the lunar items that you acquired, including the lunar staff, or else the kindling will not work and will be lost. You can get another by talking to the Oneiromancer. Light the brazier with your tinderbox and use the soaked kindling on the brazier.

You are now in the Dream World . If you log out or lose connection in the Dream World you will have to enter again using more soaked kindling, but any progress made in the Dream World will be saved. Talk to the Ethereal Being on the central platform, where they will tell you that you need to face six puzzles. At the edges of Dream World are stone portal-like things; step into them to attempt each puzzle. After completing each puzzle, talk to the being in the centre again to discuss what the challenge has taught you.

The Ethereal Fluke 's challenge involves dice . You need to get the dice to add up to the numbers that the Ethereal Fluke calls out, but it's not as random as it seems; the dice only have two possible combinations when you roll them, corresponding to the number opposite them on a die. Opposite sides of a die always add up to 7 , meaning the following:

Centre dice are worth either 1 or 6 East dice are worth either 4 or 3 West dice are worth either 5 or 2

When the puzzle resets, the initial value will always come out to 21. Based on this, one can easily solve this puzzle with a little addition or subtraction.

Flipping a 1 will add 5 to the total Flipping a 2 will add 3 to the total Flipping a 3 will add 1 to the total Flipping a 4 will subtract 1 from the total Flipping a 5 will subtract 3 from the total Flipping a 6 will subtract 5 from the total

Example solve: the Ethereal Fluke asks for 20, so flip a 4 over to reach the goal.

30 | 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4

Once finished, you'll be taken back to the centre. Tell the Ethereal Being what you've learned and enter the next puzzle.

The Ethereal Numerator 's challenge is to complete mathematical sequences by pressing the correct floating numbers. The Ethereal Numerator will call out a sequence, and you must figure out the pattern and press the next two numbers. For example, if the sequence is 1, 4, 2, 5, the first answer is 3 ( 1 , 4, 2 , 5, 3 ) and the next answer is 6 (1, 4 , 2, 5 , 3, 6 ).

It is possible to get the same sequence more than once. A list of possible sequences follows:

This is a simple Woodcutting game, wherein all you must do is chop more logs than the Ethereal Perceptive . The goal is to be the first one to stack 20 logs in the centre on the "Deposit Log pile ". If you're limited on inventory spaces, simply chop a few at a time and then stack them and continue cutting, but note that once you have deposited 20 logs, you'll be unable to pick up your items. The Ethereal Perceptive supplies a bronze axe if you don't have an axe of your own. This is one of the easier challenges.

This challenge tests your memory. Speak to the Ethereal Guide , you have to jump between platforms hoping not to find the false platforms that will collapse and return you to the start.

A simple Agility test. Beat the Ethereal Expert to the end of the passage by jumping four hurdles whilst he walks a straight path. This is fairly easy though an Agility potion and some food might help because failing a hurdle will cost you 8 Hitpoints .

A mime-copying game, very similar to the mime random event . Simply copy the emotes the Ethereal Mimic uses. After each emote, the mime will teleport to a different location. Talk to them again for the next.

Once you've completed all the challenges, talk to the guide in the centre, and they will ask if you are ready to face the ultimate challenge. Say that you are, and you get to face " Me ", a level 79 opponent who's pretty easy and is geared to your stats . You will occasionally be teleported around this arena, but this is more annoying than dangerous. The chats are quite amusing from "Me", so listen out!

Once you have defeated "Me", talk to the guide at the centre of the Dream World , then exit via the lectern, and go and talk to the Oneiromancer again.

Congratulations, quest complete!

Tip: Before leaving Lunar Isle you can unlock the Ourania Teleport spell. If you intend on doing this, switch spellbooks to the Lunar spellbook at the altar next to the Oneiromancer before going to Baba Yaga .

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

After you give Meteora her special tiara, she still seems to be wearing the Lunar amulet on her head on her chathead and in-game. Meteora's dialogue is a subtle reference to the way a peasant speaks to King Arthur in the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail . Having the Book o' piracy in your inventory at the start of the quest modifies some of the pirate's conversation with you. Before you enter the dream, if you re-obtain the kindling and potion from the Oneiromancer and then soak the kindling and drop it, you are left with an empty lunar vial . You can fill this up with water again and mix in a guam leaf and a marrentill once more for 84 Herblore experience per herb; you cannot, however, empty out the vials and must go through dialogue to get more of them. During the quest, Captain Bentley tells the player he stole the ship from a Karamjan port and that the doors were too small for his crew. This is a reference to the Grand Tree Quest , in which Glough , a gnome, commissioned ships to be built at the Shipyard on Karamja for his gnome army. At a certain point when speaking to Captain Bentley, you start the dialogue by saying "Oh captain, my captain". This is a reference to the poem of the same name by Walt Whitman, popularised by the film Dead Poets Society . In the "Communicating in Numbers" section of the Dream World , the examine text for the number 3 is "The magic number" . This is a reference to the Schoolhouse Rock! song "3 Is A Magic Number". In the "Chop, Chop, Chop Away!" section of the Dream World, the examine text for the pile of logs is "Like a pile of memes" . The examine text of a Suqah tooth is "The tooth, whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth" , which is a reference to the legally binding oath that is used in the United States' courts before a witness testifies. When examining the Mimic, the text reads "I wanna be like you-ooo-ooo!" This is a reference to King Louie from the animated film The Jungle Book . In the Dream World, if you click on one of the Ethereal Beings while still in the falling animation, your character will turn to them while still face down.
