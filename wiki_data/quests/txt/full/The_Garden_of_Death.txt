Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Starting the quest [ edit | edit source ]

To start the quest, head to the campsite located south of the lizardman settlement in the Kebos Lowlands . Fairy ring B L S is the closest teleport.

Alternatively, players can head to the Shayziens' Wall and make their way south-west, or start from Mount Quidamortem and head south-east – in these cases, be wary of aggressive lizardmen and lizardmen brutes or mountain trolls .

Search the tent to start the quest and receive Kasonde's journal . Read the journal, discovering about the Old Ones , who were once an ancient race that inhabited what is today the Kingdom of Varlamore , and suggests lizardmen architecture was derived from theirs. Search the camping equipment for some secateurs if you don't already have some, and climb down the nearby hole .

A swampy dungeon [ edit | edit source ]

You will arrive in a dungeon with lizardmen architecture and a set of farming patches. Look around the stone tables until you see one with a "Search" option. This will give you your first stone tablet . Read it to discover that it is written in an ancient unknown language. Upon closing the interface, you will receive a set of incomplete word translations which you must uncover further in the quest.

The other stone tables should now have "Search" options; do so to receive two wood carvings . Inspect these to view detailed illustrations and words corresponding with them. One of the vases can be searched to receive a dirty note ; this gives the players a hint on how to translate the carvings. Next, search the stone chest at the eastern end to learn the phrase 'Miki Toka'.

Once you believe you've figured out the meaning of the words, read the word translations again and click "Attempt Translation"; you will be prompted to enter a word's translation. Input the following words:

Island = Ikam Lake/Pond/Water = Ates Time/Death = Miki Vessel/Container/Holder = Toka Garden/Plant/Tree/Forest/Wood = Tlane North = Makt

As you translate the words, the stone tablet you read earlier will automatically translate the words you know of. You will be directed to somewhere north under an island. The only large island that currently can be travelled to is the one on Lake Molch . If you don't have a pair of secateurs on you, climb back up and search the camping equipment for one before leaving, as you'll need it for the next part.

Players can quickly get there by using fairy ring code D J R and running south-west to the northern dock. From the dock, board the boaty to Molch Island . Alternatively, you can teleport to Shayzien via Kharedst's memoirs and run north-west to the east dock near the Giant Pit .

Lake Molch Island [ edit | edit source ]

Upon arriving at Molch Island, climb down the hole behind the hut to arrive at a similarly looking dungeon. Inspect the vines for another dirty note, which suggests that Kasonde Shaw returned to his camp as you left.

Cut the vines and squeeze through them, and once again look around the stone tables for one with a "Search" option. This will give you your second stone tablet . Read it, and the other stone table behind you should now have a "Search" option, which will give you your third wood carving . On the eastern side of the room, search the vase for your fourth wood carving, as well as the other vase for the phrase 'Tlane Kualt' and the chest for the phrase 'Olkat'. Lastly, search the rubble by the farming patches below the platform for your fifth wood carving.

After inspecting the carvings, input the following words into the word translations:

West = Silam Poison = Achi Animal/Creature = Ayak Body = Olkat Food/Eat/Feed = Kualt Earth/Land/Ground = Xali Air/Wind = Ehke Fire/Destroy/Break = Tepat

Once these words are translated, you will be prompted to read the stone tablet for your next steps. You will be directed somewhere west of the lake. Leave the dungeon, and board the boaty to travel to Molch . Upon arrival, make your way south-west to Xeric's Shrine .

Xeric's Shrine [ edit | edit source ]

Upon arriving at Xeric's Shrine, climb down the hole at the eastern side of the shrine to arrive in the third dungeon. Search the south-eastern stone table for your third stone tablet, then search the open stone chest adjacent to it for a compass . Inspect it to discover the word equivalents for the cardinal directions.

Next, search the vase just north, the other two stone tables, and the huge mushroom in the centre for the next four wood carvings. After inspecting the carvings, input the following words into the word translations:

Build/Create/Make = Chua Yes/Success/Right/Correct = Kemo No/Failure/Wrong/Incorrect = Ami Move/Transfer/Deliver/Send = Lini Arrive/Here = Xita East = Takam South = Uitt

Once these words are translated, you will be prompted to read the stone tablet for your next steps. You will be directed to a structure somewhere in a forest south-east. The final location is the Ruins of Morra ; players can leave the dungeon, board the boaty to travel to Shayzien , and run south-east past the Shayziens' Wall . Alternatively, players can leave the dungeon and teleport to Shayzien via Kharedst's memoirs and run southwards.

Ruins of Morra [ edit | edit source ]

The last hole to enter is found in front of the large step pyramid in the Ruins of Morra . Search the southern stone table for the final stone tablet, and search the other stone tables, vase, stone chest, and rubble for the remaining wood carvings and dirty note.

After inspecting the carvings, input the following words into the word translations:

Small/Few/Little = Amok Big/Many/Plenty/Lots = Siua Light/Sun = Ralo Dark/Moon = Rani Life/Soul = Tal Death/Time/Die/Kill = Miki Knowledge/Mind = Yoka Home = Antil

Once these words are translated, you will be prompted to read the stone tablet and to take a warning note that you spotted on the floor.

Read it to discover that Kasonde Shaw was several steps ahead of you and that you must have come to the same conclusion: that the Old Ones were the first ones to perform soul transference, rather than the Citizens of Arceuus .

Congratulations, quest complete!

Changes [ edit | edit source ]

Date | Changes

7 December 2022 ( update ) | Players are now prompted whether they want to attempt another translation after inputting a correct one. Inputting a translation for a word the player hasn't discovered yet in-game now results in a different message. Reading the stone tablet is now clearer; blue translated words now indicate words in incorrect context, whilst new, green translated words indicate the word is correct in context. Players can no longer teleport within the dungeons; attempting to do so results in the game message " An ancient magical force blocks your teleport. " The dragonkin symbols have been removed from the stone chests in the dungeons. The dirty notes, wood carvings, and compass now have a "Drop" option instead of "Destroy".

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

The word for "moon" in the quest is "rani," and the word for sun is "ralo," which is a reference to Ranul and Ralos , the gods of the moon and the sun. Despite the name and reward of the quest, the only farming related activity the player does is cutting one set of vines with a pair of secateurs. Once you successfully translate the stone tablet for the first time, the first sentence is two words: "Amok Time." This is the title of the first episode of the second season of the 1966 television series Star Trek . Once fully translated so that all of the text is green the tablets read as follows: Little time. Soul vessel success. Send vessel north. Life garden below lake island. Many body needed. Body need life. Feed body soul vessel. Need knowledge garden transfer method. West below poison water land. Transfer method success. Body success. Soul vessel success. Time arrived. Death poison needed. Death create life. Death garden deliver. South-east below forest building. Death poison fail. Plant create dark death. Send home. Home destroyed. No life. Soul vessel fail. Zema-tal destroyed.
