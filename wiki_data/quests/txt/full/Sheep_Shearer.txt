Introduction [ edit | edit source ]

Like Cook's Assistant , this quest is designed to help players explore the starting area of Lumbridge . New players are encouraged to follow the steps below to explore different parts of the town; however, collecting and spinning the wool are optional, as the balls of wool are tradeable between players and sold in stores. The fastest way to complete the quest is to simply buy 20 balls of wool from the Grand Exchange and then give them to Fred.

Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Speak to Fred the Farmer at his sheep farm, found slightly north of the Lumbridge Castle . Ask about a quest, and he will task you with bringing him 20 balls of wool .

Obtaining the wool [ edit | edit source ]

If you do not have shears , Fred will give you some. Enter the fenced area containing sheep , connected to the east side of his house.

Shear the sheep, either by selecting the "shear" option on the sheep, or right-clicking the shears and selecting "use," then clicking the sheep to use the shears on them directly. Sheep with wool will look puffy, and sheep without wool will look skinny; you will need to shear the puffy ones twenty times. If none are available simply wait, as they will grow back their wool after one minute. Sometimes they will run away from you if you try to shear them; keep trying and eventually you will get them.

Watch out for rams during this part of the quest. They look very similar to sheep , but left-clicking attacks them; they cannot be sheared, only fought. Rams have horns and sheep do not.

Fred the Farmer will warn you about " The Thing " and tells you to be wary of it while in the sheep pen; it is actually two penguins in a disguise, from the Cold War quest , located by being the only sheep with an option to talk to it. Attempting to shear "the Thing" makes the penguins squeak and run from you. There is no danger from it during the quest.

Spinning the wool [ edit | edit source ]

Once you have 20 pieces of wool , you now need to spin them into balls of wool. Go to the 1 st floor [ UK ] 2 nd floor [ US ] of the Lumbridge Castle , and find the bedroom on the south end of the castle. Inside is a spinning wheel ; click on the wheel with the wool in your inventory to spin your wool into balls. When they are all spun, go back to Fred the Farmer to finish the quest. If you do not have the space to carry all 20 pieces of wool, you can make smaller deliveries until you reach the required total.

Players planning to do more free-to-play quests right after this one are advised to shear and spin at least three more balls of wool , for use in Prince Ali Rescue .

Congratulations, quest complete!
