Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Head to the Goblin Cave entrance located just east of the Fishing Guild 's entrance. Enter the cave and walk north, then west until you find two goblin guards guarding the entrance to the temple. Drink a dose of goblin potion and enter the temple. Do not equip the ghostspeak amulet and ring of visibility yet, or you will revert to human form and be expelled from the temple.

Make your way to the crypt within the Goblin Temple , and once inside then equip the ghostspeak amulet and ring of visibility or Ring of shadows . You will see the ghost of Hopespear , the goblin prophet. Ask him why he is here, and he will tell you that he is waiting for the Big High War God to take his spirit to Yu'biusk .

Tell him that you have been to Yu'biusk, and he will ask you for a favour: to free the souls of the goblin high priests. To do this, you must complete a ritual which includes killing the goblin priests, without the use of weapons, spells, or armour, and retrieving their bones to be buried in Yu'biusk.

Remove any items you have equipped or else the goblin high priests will not drop their bones upon defeat. This includes any equipment that gives stat bonuses, and jewellery like rings of recoil . Attempting to cheese the fights with stat-less attack speed enhancing weapons such as the Ham joint or Goblin paint cannon will not work either. However, the ghostspeak amulet and ring of visibility or ring of shadows can still be worn.

Now summon and battle the five high priests as done during Land of the Goblins by speaking their name over their grave. Unlike the quest, the high priests can be fought in any order.

Priest | Level | Grave location | Attack Style

 | Snothead | 32 | South-west | Melee

 | Snailfeet | 56 | South-east | Melee and Ranged

 | Mosschin | 88 | North-west | Melee, and Magic

 | Redeyes | 121 | North-east | Melee, Magic and Ranged (Lowers Attack, Strength and Defence)

 | Strongbones | 184 | North | Melee, Magic, and Ranged. Summons level 29 skoblins , and lowers Attack, Strength and Defence

Strongbones is by far the hardest of the high priests. To take him on it is recommended to have at least level 70 melee stats along with 70 Prayer for Piety , or slightly higher melee stats if using Chivalry . Redeyes and Strongbones will also periodically lower your Attack, Strength and Defence, so a few regular super combat potions are also advised to keep boosting throughout the fight. Strongbones will hit up to 18 regularly so bring as much high-healing food as possible, as well as 2-3 prayer potions (3-4 if around 70 melee stats) to keep up Protect from Melee and Piety. Having access to the Ring of shadows over the Ring of visibility will also aid in boosting combat stats.

Note: You can recharge your prayer inbetween fights at the altar outside of the crypt, provided you still have doses of your goblin potion. Drink a dose of it before leaving the tomb. You also do not have to defeat all the high priests in one go; you can leave the crypt to restock and bank any bones collected thus far. When returning, another dose of goblin potion is needed to enter the crypt but the ghostspeak amulet and ring of visibility are not needed . If you die fighting any of the high priests, you will lose any bones in your inventory and they will not be protected by your gravestone, so you must fight them again. Your gravestone will appear in the Goblin Cave , near the stairs leading to the temple, thus, you do not need another dose of goblin potion to reclaim your items.

Note: You must pick up each goblin's set of bones before killing the next, as the new goblin's death will cause the old goblin's bones to despawn.

Finally, use fairy ring code B L Q to reach Yu'biusk, and once there bury the bones. Players do not need to bury all five sets of bones at once. Burying all of the bones will complete the miniquest.

The rewarded XP for each priest is as following:

Priest bone | Prayer experience

 | Snothead's bone | 1,250

 | Snailfeet's bone | 2,500

 | Mosschin's bone | 5,000

 | Redeyes' bone | 10,000

 | Strongbones' bone | 20,000

Total | 38,750

These bones do not benefit from the increased experience bonus granted after burning chewed bones on a pyre ship , nor can they be converted using the Sinister Offering spell.

Historical [ edit | edit source ]

Hopespear's Will was released in RuneScape on 12 November 2007 alongside Land of the Goblins. Both this miniquest and its parent quest were extracted from the August 2007 Archive of RuneScape that Old School RuneScape is built off of. Compared to the original, the Old School version has a few differences:

Level 50 Prayer is required to start the miniquest, rather than level 40 in RuneScape . The total amount of Prayer experience rewarded is 38,750, rather than 13,750 in RuneScape . The goblin high priests are significantly stronger than their RuneScape counterparts.

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

Hopespear's Will is the first miniquest from the original game to be ported to Old School RuneScape since the start of the game.
