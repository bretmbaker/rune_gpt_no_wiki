Getting started [ edit | edit source ]

Items required: 3 regular planks , a bronze bar , molten glass

Speak with the Observatory professor , located in the reception room of the Observatory (near the Observatory tower) ( Minigame Teleport : Castle Wars , ring of dueling or other methods can be used and then travel north). Ask if you can look through the telescope and he says that it's broken. He tells you that a family of goblins has tampered with the telescope, so ask if you can help. He says that he needs some wood for the tripod, bronze for the tube, and glass for a new lens.

Once you have these three items, bring them back to the professor who will take them from you. He then says that he needs a mould so that he can make a new lens.

Retrieving the lens mould [ edit | edit source ]

Items required: None.

Recommended: An antipoison potion, energy potions, combat equipment (for lower levels) and food

Go down the stairs to the east of the reception room to find the Observatory Dungeon (the room with the stairs is directly east of the start point).
Once down the stairs, you must find the goblin kitchen key . It is commonly found in the south-eastern most chest although it can vary from person to person. Search any chests you pass on the way to the south-eastern chest just in case. Keep searching the chests (refer to the map) until you find the key. Once you search the correct chest, make sure you complete the dialogue for taking the key or else you will not receive it and will have to return to the chest.

Sometimes there may be a poisonous spider (level 31) inside the chest in which case run away quickly or you may get poisoned .

Now that you've got the key, head to the kitchen gate (take the north-eastern path from the stair entrance and follow it west), and "prod" the sleeping guard (level 42). He will wake up and attack you. You can either defeat him or get him stuck behind a wall.

Open the kitchen gate (you will use the key and discard it), and then inspect the goblin stove. You determine the goblins are cooking something foul in the lens mould . Dump out the stew and bring this back to the professor.

His assistant will ask you not to give it to him, as last time the professor attempted to craft something, the explosion took a week to clean up. The professor agrees and gives you back the molten glass and mould.

Use the molten glass with the lens mould to craft him a new lens . Give it back to the professor. He will want you to visit him in the Observatory.

The Observatory [ edit | edit source ]

Climb back down the stairs into the Observatory Dungeon . Now follow the north-west passage (past the kitchen) to find some stairs leading to the Observatory (the southern set of stairs on the map). There is also a chest north-east of the stairs to the Observatory , which spawns infinite Antipoison(1) vials, which you can combine to make full vials.

Go up the stairs, and a cutscene will play. After the cutscene ends, go up the stairs and talk to the professor , and then "view" the telescope to see a constellation.

After closing the window, the professor should ask you which constellation you saw. The constellations are on wall charts in the main level of the Observatory. Identify your constellation, talk to the professor again, and you should get your reward in your inventory.

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

If the player talks to the Observatory assistant after the quest, he will give the player a jug of wine as thanks for the help. He will also tell the player his and the professor's real names, which are Patrick and Mambo-duna-roona, respectively. The professor may give you a chart during or after the quest. Although it is no longer a requirement now, you may still want to keep it for Treasure Trails . After the quest is completed, the drop rate of mithril bolts from chaos druids and elder chaos druids will be slightly decreased, due to the unholy mould drop that is added to their tables.
