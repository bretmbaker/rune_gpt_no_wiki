Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Getting started [ edit | edit source ]

Talk to Father Aereck , found in the Lumbridge chapel just east of Bob's Brilliant Axes . Tell him that you are looking for a quest, he will say that a ghost is haunting the graveyard, and that he needs the player to help him. He then asks you to talk to Father Urhney , located in a house west of Lumbridge Swamp , and get some information from him on ghosts.

Finding Father Urhney [ edit | edit source ]

Go south of the castle, and into the Lumbridge Swamp . Head west through the swamp until you come upon a small house, and go inside and talk to the irate Father Urhney . After you mention Father Aereck 's request, Father Urhney will give you an amulet of ghostspeak , which will allow you to communicate with the ghost. It is advised to keep the amulet for future quests. Once you have the amulet in your inventory , teleport or run back to Lumbridge, and make your way to the graveyard located beside the chapel.

Freeing the ghost [ edit | edit source ]

Locate the marble coffin , located in a small building in the south-east corner of the graveyard. Wear your amulet of ghostspeak and search the coffin, and a ghost will dramatically emerge. Talk to the ghost, and he will tell you he is missing his skull, and wants you to get it for him. He will mention that he was near the Wizards' Tower on an island south of Draynor Village when he died.

Head to the Wizards' Tower , and climb down the ladder in the room directly next to the entrance. Across the room, you will find an altar, which you will need to search to obtain the ghost's skull . Be aware when you grab the skull that a skeleton will appear and attack you; fighting the skeleton is optional, so feel free to run outside of the room without fighting back. Make sure you have the skull in your inventory.

Run or teleport back to Lumbridge and then walk back to the restless ghost and speak with it.

He'll want you to put the skull in his coffin. Use the skull on the coffin, and you will see the ghost's spirit disappear into the river.

Congratulations, quest complete!

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

Interestingly, killing the skeleton in the basement of the Wizard's Tower will not count as a kill for a skeleton Slayer task . It also does not give the normal amount of combat experience when fought. While not intended, you can understand the ghost in the ending cutscene of the quest even without a ghostspeak amulet equipped. If the quest is completed with 0 Prayer experience, the reward increases the player's Prayer level from 1 to 9.
