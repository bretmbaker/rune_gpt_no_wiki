Talk to Brother Omad at the Ardougne Monastery south of Ardougne . Teleport nearby via Ardougne Cloak 1 , fairy rings code D J P , or Fishing Trawler minigame teleport and walking north. He wants you to retrieve a child's blanket from some thieves found in a secret cave hidden under a ring of stones west of the monastery.

Child's blanket [ edit | edit source ]

Head west immediately after exiting the Ardougne Monastery . East of the Gnome Battlefield and south-west of the Clock Tower , there is a perfect circle of grey stones. When inside the ring, a ladder will appear.

Climb down the ladder into a large dungeon. Take the first path south into the room at the end, where you'll find the child's blanket on the table guarded by two level 14 thieves and a level 26 Head Thief .

Bring the blanket back to Omad . He will be pleased because he can sleep now. Talk to Omad again . He is now better and wants to organise a party for a child's birthday.

Brother Cedric [ edit | edit source ]

Note: Make sure you click chat option "Where should I look?" then double check quest log before leaving Omad, or you won't be able to sober up Cedric.

Brother Omad needs the wine from Brother Cedric , who seems to be lost in the forest south of Ardougne .

Leave the monastery and head directly north, he is located south of the Ardougne Zoo 's camel cage. He's very drunk and needs a jug of water to sober up. A jug of water can be found in the cooking shop in Yanille or the general store in Port Khazard . You cannot use the well next to Cedric to fill up your jug, but you can use the bucket on the well, then the bucket of water on a jug . There is also a sink south of the monastery. Alternatively, you can kill imps near Port Khazard for either a full or empty jug.

Give the jug of water to Cedric to sober him up. Now, he needs logs or a plank to repair his cart. Cut a log if needed and talk to Cedric again. Only regular logs work. If you do not have an axe, there are plank spawns in Port Khazard, south-west of the bank chest.  He can now repair his cart and wants you to go back to Brother Omad to tell him he is coming soon.

Go back to Brother Omad , who will finally start the party.

Congratulations, quest complete!
