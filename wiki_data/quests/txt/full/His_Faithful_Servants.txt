Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Speak to the Strange Old Man at the Barrows . He will ask that you retrieve an icon that the Barrows Brothers have guarded and that an unknown entity wants back.

Players must defeat all six brothers and then open the Barrows chest to receive the strange icon . For a guide on taking on the brothers, see here .

You MUST have enough inventory space to receive the strange icon when looting the chest, as it will not drop to the ground and will require you to defeat all the brothers again. If you want to be sure that you will receive the icon, leave at least six inventory spaces open before searching the chest.

After receiving the strange icon, speak with the Strange Old Man again to complete the miniquest.

Rewards [ edit | edit source ]

A dusty lamp , which awards 20,000 Prayer experience. A crypt map that upon studying permanently reveals the minimap while in the Barrows crypt and is then destroyed.

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

The miniquest was first teased during the April 2023 Game Jam by Mod Ed . [1] The retrieval of the strange icon from the Barrows for a mysterious benefactor is heavily reminiscent of the Runescape quest The Temple at Senntisten , in which the player retrieves it for Azzanadra as one of the items he requires in order to communicate with Zaros in Freneskae . This is alluded to in the Strange Old Man's dialogue after destroying it ( The old plan is gone. We're not doing it that way. ).
