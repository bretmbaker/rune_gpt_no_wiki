League notes | Impossible to complete, as it requires visits to Asgarnia ✓ , Kandarin ✓ , Desert ✓ , Fremennik ✓ , and Morytania ✓ . As such, players are advised not to start the quest, so that the quest-specific bones do not pollute the ground. If the player has started the quest, the pollution can be avoided by keeping the bone in the inventory or bank.

Overview [ edit | edit source ]

The monsters you need to kill are mentioned on the Wish List that is pinned to the Odd Old Man 's house as well as in your quest journal . Monsters are only removed from these lists after the bones have been properly turned in to the Odd Old Man. Each monster on the list has a 1/4 [1] chance to drop the bone you need. It is possible to hand in the collected bones in smaller batches. The Odd Old Man will kindly update the wish list, taking off the bone(s) you've submitted. It is possible to collect the basilisk bone without 20 Defence , but you must freeze the basilisk or safespot it. Due to the variety of monsters you're required to kill, it may be a good idea to simply start the quest, especially early in your adventures, and collect some of the bones while traversing Gielinor (or training skills, such as Slayer ). Note that when you die, bones will be taken to Death's Coffer . If the bones aren't dropped or in your bank, you may find them in Death's office.

Obtaining bones - Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

This walkthrough can be completed in any order. It's sectioned by distance to the starting location of the quest (the Odd Old Man 's house) and also by what bones are most easily found in that particular area. Traverse from area to area in whatever way is most convenient for you. The determining factor will be the travelling methods ( gnome glider , fairy rings ) and teleports you have access to or prefer to use.

Further, the below guide only exists to group various monsters together and create a sensible path (even if walking the distance) to collect all of the bones. Use the above list or view the individual pages for the monsters to see other possible locations they can be found at.

Note: You do not have to bring all of the bones to the Odd Old Man at once. If at any point you obtain a bone or collection of bones and wish to turn them in, you can jump to the polishing the bones section in order to do so.

Polishing the bones [ edit | edit source ]

Tip: To cut down on trips, lower your hitpoints to 1 using a dwarven rock cake or locator orb , then bring a tinder box and 27 logs to the Odd Old Man and let the bats nearby kill you. Then, bring your bones in vinegar to the Odd Old Man and withdraw your tinderbox and a log from your gravestone. Continue to withdraw logs as needed. This allows you to polish all the bones in 2 trips.

Using an equipped log basket can allow for all bones to be done in 1 trip.

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

Rag-and-bone man is a British phrase for a junk dealer. Historically, the phrase referred to an individual who would travel the streets of a city with a horsedrawn cart, and would collect old rags (for converting into fabric and paper), bones for making glue, scrap iron and other items, often trading them for other items of limited value. The bones scattered in and around the Odd Old Man 's house have many interesting "examine" texts (a good activity to partake in while waiting for the bones to be polished). One such skeleton states "What a waste of prayer xp!" Examining the pot-boiler at the various stages of boiling the bones will also give interesting texts, the one while the bone is boiling being "This smells so very, very bad..." After completing the quest, the Wish-List on his house will have "Non-chafing Manacles" written on it. Rag and Bone Man II was formerly the miniquest named "Rag & Bone Wish List"; it is not the same as RuneScape ' s sequel quest Fur 'n Seek . As, unlike all other miniquests, the wish list awarded one quest point, it was renamed Rag and Bone Man II and reclassified as a quest in an update on 17 August 2017 . Previously in the game, a player needed to choose between the bonesack and ram skull helm as a reward for having completed the quest, but could swap one for the other at any time by talking to the Odd Old Man again. This was later changed at an update , allowing players to possess both at the same time.
