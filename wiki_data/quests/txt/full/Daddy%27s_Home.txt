Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Starting out [ edit | edit source ]

Begin the miniquest by speaking to Marlo in the house of the Varrock Estate Agent in north-east Varrock. He will ask you if you would be willing to complete an off-the-books favour for him by helping his father renovate his recently acquired house, explaining that the landlord isn't exactly aware of his presence there. He will direct you to Old Man Yarlo in his house in south-east Varrock, south-west of Aubury's Rune Shop . There is a saw on the ground in the same building as Marlo.

Yarlo's house [ edit | edit source ]

Items required: 10 planks , 5 bolts of cloth , a hammer , and a saw . Items recommended: At least 60 nails of any type.

Speak to Old Man Yarlo and he'll ask you to remove all of the old furniture in the house: a chair, a carpet, two tables, two stools, and his campbed. You must right click the carpet for the option to remove to appear. If you interrupt the cutscene you will have to rewatch it. Once this is done, speak with him again to be given the option to view a cutscene showing the wonders of the Construction skill, or skip it to watch later. Once this is done, Old Man Yarlo will ask you to build him new furniture. Everything except the bed can be built now, however the bed requires a special type of wood; search the crates in the kitchen to receive three waxwood logs , and bring them to the sawmill .

Furniture | Item requirements | Experience

Carpet | 3 bolts of cloth | 45 xp

2 wooden stools | 2 planks and 4 nails in total | 30 xp per stool

2 wooden tables | 6 planks and 8 nails in total | 87 xp per table

Wooden chair | 2 planks and 2 nails | 58 xp

Waxwood bed | 3 waxwood planks and 2 bolts of cloth | 207 xp

Finishing up [ edit | edit source ]

Items required: 3 waxwood logs .

Go to the Varrock sawmill and talk to the sawmill operator to receive 3 waxwood planks . Since he knows of Old Man Yarlo, he'll provide them free of charge.

Return to Old Man Yarlo's home and build the new furniture (chair, carpet, two tables, two stools, and the bed). Speak to Old Man Yarlo again, he'll thank you and offer the player the basics and benefits of Construction .

Finally, return to Marlo to claim your reward.
