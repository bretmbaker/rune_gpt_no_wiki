Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Beginning the quest [ edit | edit source ]

Talk to Martin the Master Gardener, near the marketplace in Draynor Village , to commence the quest. The fastest teleport to the village is with the amulet of glory . Martin will mention that his roses haven't been doing as well as they used to, and he suspects something's wrong. He wants you to ask several other members of G.A.G. (Group of Advanced Gardeners) if they're having the same problems as him.

Gathering information [ edit | edit source ]

You will have to speak with any five members of the Group of Advanced Gardeners . These are the gardeners that tend farming patches around Gielinor . Some of the easiest to reach are:

Frizzy Skernip , near the fence between Port Sarim and Draynor Village Elstan , one screen north of Frizzy (if you have no secateurs yet, you can buy them for 5 coins from Sarah nearby) Heskel , at the tree patch in Falador Park Dreven , at the bush patch near the Champions' Guild Vasquen , South-east of Champions' Guild . Fayeth , just west of Lumbridge Castle Treznor , inside the Varrock Palace grounds Alain , at the tree patch in Taverley , east of the house portal Taria , just west of the house portal in Rimmington Torrell , by the Kandarin Monastery

Note: Ayesha in Al Kharid , Lammy Langle north-east of the Woodcutting Guild , Imiago in Tai Bwo Wannai , and Marisi in Hosidius do not count for this quest.

An efficient method of speaking to five members of the Group of Advanced Gardeners :

Teleport to Varrock : Visit Treznor , inside the Varrock Palace grounds Visit Dreven , at the bush patch near the Champions' Guild Teleport to Falador: Visit Heskel , at the tree patch in Falador Park Visit Elstan , one screen north of Frizzy Visit Frizzy Skernip , near the fence between Port Sarim and Draynor Village

Following this method should put you right next to Martin the Master Gardener once you've spoken to Frizzy Skernip .

All of them will say that since recently they have troubles with their crops. They all suspect a different reason (lack of rain, swarms of insects, adventurers digging up the patches, the seasons being off their usual times) for it, though. However, the last gardener you ask will have more interesting explanation, suggesting the fairies might have something to do with it. Speak to Martin again , to whom you suggest the last gardener might have the most accurate reasoning.

Travel to the fairy city of Zanaris . You'll have to enter the city via the shack in the middle of the Lumbridge Swamp , while having a Dramen staff equipped, similar to how you entered the city during the Lost City quest.

Trouble in Zanaris [ edit | edit source ]

Head to the Fairy Queen 's throne room, just south of where you enter the city. However, you will find that the " Fairy Godfather " has replaced the queen. He'll tell you that the queen has fallen to some sort of illness, and that she's under the care of Fairy Nuff . Speak with this fairy in the north-west of the city. She'll give you details about the queen's illness and give you a symptoms list to take to a wizard named Zandar Horfyre , in the Dark Wizards' Tower .

Investigating the illness [ edit | edit source ]

Travel to Falador and head west to reach the Dark Wizards' Tower . Climb up to the top floor and talk to Zandar , who will take the symptom list and then suggest talking to Malignius Mortifer about killing the Tanglefoot. This necromancer can be found on the crossroads south of Falador. You can fast travel to him with a skills necklace (to the Crafting Guild).

He'll tell you he could probably help, but wants something from you first. He wants a skull from a grave in the Draynor Manor backyard. Head to the back of the manor and dig up the grave there. In case you have no spade , there is one inside the manor. If you have dug up the skull previously, you will not find it, and your character will mention that they think they stored it in the bank.

Zandar's location. | Malignius' location. | Draynor Skull's location. | The grave where you will find the skull

Blessed secateurs [ edit | edit source ]

Once you have the skull , go back to Malignius and give it to him. He'll tell you that the queen's illness has to do with an evil creature called the Tanglefoot . You'll have to kill it with a pair of enchanted secateurs , as nothing else can damage it. To obtain these, Malignius will tell you to take a pair of secateurs and three randomised items to the Nature Grotto . These three items are chosen from the list below, and may be obtained via any method. Check your quest log to see what items you need to bring.

Note that these items follow a certain pattern. You'll always need to collect three items that follow each other in the list below (e.g. 4-5-6, 12-13-14). For example, the Mort myre pear (#2) will only be combined with the White berries (#1) and the Mort myre stem (#3) (1-2-3), or the Mort myre stem (#3) and the Mort myre fungus (#4) (2-3-4).

If you are out of prayer points, you can restore them by using the Altar of nature inside the Nature Grotto .

Killing the Tanglefoot [ edit | edit source ]

 | This fight takes place in an instance . On death , all unprotected items will be moved to a grave outside the instance. Any items left on the ground will be lost.

Head back to Zanaris with your magic secateurs . From the entrance to the city, travel south-west, past the agility shortcuts , to the mysterious ruins of the Cosmic Altar . There is a gap on the west side of the room that you can climb through. The Gatekeeper there will let you pass. Inside the tunnel are a few baby tanglefeet (level 45). Proceed to the end of the tunnel to stumble upon the level 111 Tanglefoot .

This creature is unique in that it can only be damaged with the magic secateurs. Furthermore, the maximum damage you can do on the Tanglefoot depends on both your Strength and Farming levels. Protect from Melee is highly recommended for the fight. The Tanglefoot can be flinched . It may be wise to ensure you have extra dramen staves in your bank in case you die and need to get back to your gravestone.

Once you have defeated the Tanglefoot, make sure to grab the Queen's secateurs when it drops, before leaving the tunnel. Head back to the Fairy Godfather , and speak with him to finish the quest.

Congratulations! Quest completed!

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

If completing this quest at level 1 Farming, the experience reward is enough to get you to level 17. Fairy Nuff put the Queen in the "Tempus fugit" state, which will make the time slow down for the Queen. "Tempus fugit" is Latin, and can be translated to "Time flies". Before handing the Symptoms List to Zandar Horfyre, he gets mad at the player for attacking his fellow Dark Wizards, even while having never done so or set foot into his tower beforehand. Martin the Master Gardener will also recognise the player as a pickpocket, even if the player has never picked his (or anyone else's) pocket. Martin the Master Gardener will not let the player start Fairytale II - Cure a Queen directly after completion, upon speaking with him he says that he needs to plant some crops and wait for them to grow before he rewards the player, and will then scold the player for impatience in the dialogue following, instructing the player to come back later. Fairytale I - Growing Pains was released exactly 4 years after Lost City . When talking to Martin about the first theory, he dismisses the lack of rain as the problem. He states that it never rains on the allotments and that's why people have to keep watering them. Upon hearing the fifth theory, which pertains to fairies, the player character becomes incredulous to the idea that fairies are not only causing the problem, but also that they even exist, despite the fact that completing Lost City is a prerequisite to even begin this quest. It is possible to ask a Tool Leprechaun about finding a fairy. However, they will direct you to Draynor Village to find Shamus instead. This can be done even before talking to the fifth gardener. The third master gardener that is spoken to during the investigation will theorise that the reason for the bad crops is due to all the adventurers repeatedly digging up and replanting the crops, thereby ruining the soil. When they ask the player about having a "secret guild" they use to annoy the gardeners, the player brings up the Heroes' Guild . The gardener takes this as a confession and tells the player to be ashamed of themselves. Attempting to talk to other gardeners after the fifth theory will have them reply with "I don't think the crops ARE failing, now leave me alone, I have work to do."
