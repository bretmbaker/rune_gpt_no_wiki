A Vampyre Threat [ edit | edit source ]

Speak to Morgan in his house in Draynor Village , just north of Ned 's house. Morgan will tell you that a vampyre is causing distress and wants you to kill it.

To acquire some garlic , go upstairs of Morgan's building and look for a cupboard. Open and search the cupboard to find it.

Morgan will also tell you to go to the Blue Moon Inn in Varrock , and talk to Dr Harlow .

The Ex-slayer [ edit | edit source ]

Go to Varrock and head to The Blue Moon Inn located south of Varrock Square. Once inside, talk to Dr Harlow . Tell him Morgan needs his help, and he will ask for a beer in return. Talk to the bartender to buy the beer, and then talk to Dr Harlow. He will talk about vampyres and give you a stake .
Next, buy a hammer from a general store if you don't already have one. You can buy it from the Varrock General Store , which is just north of Blue Moon Inn . The closest general store to Draynor is in Lumbridge . There is also a hammer spawn point upstairs in the Falador furnace room.

Count Draynor [ edit | edit source ]

Items needed: weapon , armour , food , garlic , hammer and a stake .

Now that you have the required items, you must now fight the vampyre . Make sure you have a weapon , armour , food , garlic , a hammer and the stake . Go to Draynor Manor . Once inside, go down the large stairs on the east side of the building. There will be a coffin in the centre of the room. Open it and the vampyre, Count Draynor , will pop up and attack you. If you have garlic, the Count will be weakened, though he will still pose a huge threat to players with a low combat level . Count Draynor can be safespotted by running to the corner between the right side of the staircase and the wall, then stepping on the same tile as Count Draynor to cause him to take that corner tile, then stepping one more tile to the right to attack him diagonally. Getting him to move into the corner can take several attempts. The candles around the Count's coffin will also "burn your feet" if you stand on top of them, but they deal no damage. When you defeat the Count, you will automatically stab him with the hammer and the stake.

You can exit Draynor Manor through the exit in the eastern-most room or teleport.

If the player does not have a hammer with them, they will receive a tooltip: "You are unable to push the stake far enough in" and will be unable to kill the Vampyre. If the player takes too long to kill Count Draynor, he will return to his coffin and heal to full health, and the player will have to start the fight all over again. You can set-up a Dwarf Multi Cannon in this area. The garlic effect is immediate upon beginning melee combat with the Count. He will take 10 damage, and his stats will be lowered: -10 to Strength and Attack, and -40 to Defence. Importantly, the debuff effect from garlic only lasts for about 30 seconds. Take advantage of the effective accuracy boost with hard hitting melee weapons while it lasts.

Congratulations, quest complete!
