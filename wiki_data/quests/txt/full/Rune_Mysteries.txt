Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Talk to Duke Horacio on the 1 st floor [ UK ] 2 nd floor [ US ] of Lumbridge Castle , and ask him if he has any quests to give out. He will explain that although he himself has no tasks for the player, he did find a strange talisman. Curious about its origin, he will give you an air talisman and ask you to bring it to the arch mage of the Wizards' Tower . Note that at this point, it is possible to use the drop trick to collect any amount of spare air talismans , either for banking some Runecraft experience on ironman accounts, or for making a small amount of money. See the money making guide for more info.

Go to the Wizards' Tower, which is south of Draynor Village . Once there, descend the ladder into the basement and converse with Archmage Sedridor . He will take your air talisman and give you a research package . He will then instruct you to deliver it to Aubury in Varrock .

Aubury is located south of Varrock's east bank , inside of his rune shop . Talk to Aubury, and he will give you some notes and instruct you to deliver them back to Wizard Sedridor.

Make your way back to the Wizards' Tower , and talk to Archmage Sedridor once more. He will give you back your air talisman and will explain to you the basics of Runecraft .

Congratulations, quest complete!
