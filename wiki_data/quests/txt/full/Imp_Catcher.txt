Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Mizgog's little helper [ edit | edit source ]

Make your way to the Wizards' Tower , south of Draynor Village and over a long stone bridge. Climb the stairs, and go up to the 2 nd floor [ UK ] 3 rd floor [ US ] . Talk to Wizard Mizgog and ask him questions to find out that he needs your help. He will tell you that Wizard Grayzag 's imps have stolen his beads and he wants you to get them back for him. He needs you to collect:

A black bead - 2,322 A yellow bead - 2,192 A red bead - 2,452 A white bead - 3,573

Obtaining beads [ edit | edit source ]

To obtain the beads, you may buy them from the Grand Exchange for a total of 10,539 , receive them in a trade with another player, or you can simply kill imps instead - each bead has a 5/128 chance of dropping. Imps can be found throughout Gielinor . There are several good spots to kill imps including: east of the Ardougne Monastery , on top of the Karamja Volcano (be aware of level 14 scorpions in this area), next to the Charcoal Burner , or by the southern entrance to Falador . Imps may teleport away when in combat making them harder to kill, beads are also an uncommon drop, thus many players will often trade for beads instead to avoid the hassle of finding the beads themselves. If you choose to kill them yourself or are an ironman , it may be an advantage to use ranged/magic attacks to reduce the running around when the imps teleport.

Once you have all four beads, return to Wizard Mizgog and give them to him to finish the quest.  He won't accept them one at a time, so ultimate ironmen should plan to get the whole thing done at once.

Congratulations, quest complete!

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

If you examine the Mizgog's table before giving him the beads, the examine text will read "A table bearing a curious device". However, once you have given him the beads the text will read "A table bearing Mizgog's beads." Completing the Imp Catcher quest with Level 1 Magic (7 Magic XP from Tutorial Island), the 875 Magic XP reward from the quest will land a player at Level 8 Magic (882 Magic XP) with another 87 Magic XP to obtain before reaching Level 9 Magic (969 Magic XP). The colours of the four beads could be a reference to the steps of the alchemical Magnum Opus : Nigredo (blackening) Albedo (whitening), Citrinitas (yellowing), and Rubedo (reddening). Beginning the quest with all four beads already in hand brings up special dialogue. Player: Well this is a surprising turn of events! Wizard Mizgog: What? Player: Well I just so happen to have all of those beads on me! Wizard Mizgog: Are you saying that you stole my beads all this time and I've been blaming these imps!? Player: No, not at all! I just found them throughout my travels and presumed somebody would need them at some point. Wizard Mizgog: Bah! Fine. Wizard Mizgog: Give them here and I'll check that they really are MY beads, before I give you your reward. You'll like it, it's an amulet of accuracy.
