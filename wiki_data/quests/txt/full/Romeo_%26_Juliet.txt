Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Starting out [ edit | edit source ]

Romeo can be found in or near Varrock Square . Speak to him, and he'll ramble about his love for Juliet . Ask him if you can help, and he'll ask  you to talk to her in her mansion.

Speaking to Juliet [ edit | edit source ]

Go and talk to Juliet, located on the upper floor of the mansion directly west of the Varrock west bank , just outside the western walls of Varrock, on the upper floor balcony. She will give you a letter to give to Romeo. Go back to Romeo at Varrock Square, and deliver the letter. If you cannot find Romeo, he may have wandered inside the general store located south of the square.

Father Lawrence [ edit | edit source ]

Romeo reads the letter and doesn't know what to do. He suggests going to Father Lawrence , who is located in the church north-east of Varrock Square. Speak to Father Lawrence. He mentions a Cadava potion and asks you to speak to the Apothecary . Talk to Romeo first and he will tell you to talk to the Apothecary .

The potion [ edit | edit source ]

Note: You can save some time by having the Cadava berries in your inventory before speaking to the apothecary. Ironman players are recommended to grab some redberries at the same time as the cadava berries , for use in later quests.

The Apothecary can be found in south-western Varrock located west of the Varrock Swordshop , in a building with a purple potion icon. Speak to the Apothecary about the quest, and he will tell you he needs cadava berries , you may need to ask him to talk about something else. Cadava berries can be found on a bush located west of the mine south-east of Varrock. When you have them, return to the Apothecary, and he will give you Cadava potion .

If you want to make multiple Cadava potions, drop the one that's in your inventory and ask for another.

Be careful as drinking the potion yourself would result in temporarily knocking yourself out.

Now, head back to Juliet, and give her the potion. You will now see a cutscene of her "dying", though she really falls into a coma.

To the crypt [ edit | edit source ]

Go back to Romeo, and tell him that he must rescue Juliet from the crypt. He needs someone to accompany him, which ends up being you. You will now see another cutscene of you entering the crypt with Romeo. When he sees Juliet's cousin, Phillipa , he forgets all about Juliet and falls in love with her.

Congratulations, quest complete!

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

If you talk to Draul Leptoc, Juliet's father, while carrying the cadava potion , he'll notice it and mention it in his dialogue. If you talk to Juliet again after the quest, she will seem fed up with Romeo. If you speak to Romeo, he will still be mistaken about Juliet's "death," and will pine after Phillipa. 'Draul Leptoc' is an anagram of 'Lord Capulet', Juliet's father in the original Romeo and Juliet . Romeo & Juliet was removed in the main RuneScape game on 21 September 2010 and replaced with Gunnar's Ground .
