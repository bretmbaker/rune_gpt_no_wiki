Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Enter Forthos Dungeon and talk to the injured monk, Brother Aimeri , located in the south-east corner of the dungeon, outside the entrance to Sarachnis ' lair. Use five pieces of food (must be fish, meat or vegetables), and he will heal to full health. Ask him who he is, and he will say he is here to discover the origins of his religion, and asks that you let him know about anything of interest that you find. Once you say "I'll keep my eyes open", the miniquest will begin.

The player must now gather four tattered sun pages , tattered moon pages and tattered temple pages . The pages are dropped by all types of monsters within the Dungeon, at the rates shown below.

Monster | Level | Hitpoints | Droprate

Sarachnis | 318 | 400 | 1/5

Red dragon | 152 | 140 | 1/10

Undead druid | 105 | 140 | 1/20

Baby red dragon | 48 | 50 | 1/25

Temple spider | 75 | 70 | 1/30

At lower levels, baby red dragons are the easiest to kill for the pages - there is an alcove in the south-east corner of the red dragon area where two baby red dragons spawn and the adult dragons cannot reach. Temple spiders may be quicker to kill, due to having more spawns and being in a multicombat area.

Once four of each page has been obtained, head west from Brother Aimeri and then north from the grubby chest into a library area with undead druids ; it is recommended to have the Protect from Magic prayer active, as their magic attacks are accurate and hit hard. Search all except the north-western bookshelves in the temple library; you should have obtained three tomes: the tome of the sun , tome of the moon and tome of the temple .

Use the pages on the respective tomes. Once filled, they can be used on Logosia in the centre of the Arceuus Library , completing the miniquest.

Reward [ edit | edit source ]

A lamp of knowledge that gives 10,000 experience in a skill of your choice that is at least level 40.

Upon completion, additional pages received can be sold to Logosia in exchange for 1,000 coins per page. You may also tell Logosia, "I'm going to stop looking for temple, sun and moon pages" to stop receiving them.

Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

After completing the miniquest, as well as having used the temple coin on the Stone Relief , the player will be able to inform the Knight of Varlamore about the Forthos Dungeon . Once doing so, he will travel to the Altar of the Sun within the dungeon, as he claims the temple may be of help in his mission. The player character's responds to Brother Aimeri saying "the greater good" by repeating "the greater good." This is a reference to the 2007 British comedy film Hot Fuzz in which characters repeat the phrase "the greater good" after one another.
