Description | During Gielinor's Second Age, the world was dominated by an empire the likes of which had never been seen. The areas now known as Asgarnia, Misthalin and even the Wilderness all once flourished under the banner of the Empty Lord. With the grand city of Senntisten at its heart, this civilisation washed over Gielinor like an unstoppable tide, pushing the boundaries of magic and science, while crushing any who stood in their way. Fast forward to today, the Fifth Age, and you won't find much trace of this ancient empire. Indeed, Saradominists and Zamorakians alike have spent many lifetimes purging all remnants of it. However, small fragments of this fallen empire remain, for those who know where to look. Perhaps you’ve already encountered some of these remains. Maybe you’ve met the monstrous Nex, sealed behind the Frozen Door for millennia. Or perhaps you’ve visited the bandits of the Kharidian Desert, the final human followers of the Empty Lord. You might even have encountered some mysterious Mahjarrat hidden away beneath those same sands. However, there are other parts of this forgotten empire that even you won’t have encountered yet. For example, this story begins deep in the desert, within a mysterious vault...

Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Before starting the quest, switch to the Ancient Magicks spellbook.

Also, be aware that a level 271 Mysterious Figure may attack whenever you carry a medallion. Teleporting away or climbing a level works to escape combat, so always keep an emergency teleport.

Familiar Faces [ edit | edit source ]

The Ancient Guardian [ edit | edit source ]

The Ancient Guardian will attack you. It has 200 Hitpoints, and a shield that regenerates when it is not being attacked with melee. It attacks with melee only , and Protect from Melee blocks all normal damage. Players should attack with melee as well, as it will ignore the shield and deal faster damage. Magic will work as well, but players will need to switch back to melee frequently.

Every five attacks, the guardian will rain rocks down from above. The rocks will deal between 15 and 25 damage if they strike you. Simply click a tile where there isn't a shadow to avoid all damage.

Note: This fight takes place in an instance; any dropped items will disappear after the fight ends.

Carnifex Maximus Vardorvis [ edit | edit source ]

Note: You can teleport out and return to The Stranglewood if you need to restock on supplies. You can gear up before facing the boss without having to redo previously completed parts, although it might be beneficial to enter the boss area before teleporting out as it unlocks a shortcut to the boss lair.

Praefectus Classis Perseriya [ edit | edit source ]

Note: The boss is fought after completing all three puzzle rooms. You do not have to bring your fighting gear when doing the puzzles, as you can safely bank and gear up after all the puzzles have been completed.

Nerve ending | Required nerves | Elemental nerves from scratch

Smoke nerve | Fire and Air | Fire x1, Air x1

Soul nerve | Mind and Mind | Mind x1, Mind x1

Blood nerve | Mind and Water | Mind x1, Water x1

Nature nerve | Water and Earth | Water x1, Earth x1

Cosmic nerve | Soul and Nature | Mind x2, Water x1, Earth x1

Astral nerve | Cosmic and Earth | Mind x2, Water x1, Earth x2

Wrath nerve | Smoke and Blood | Fire x1, Air x1, Mind x1, Water x1

Prepare to fight The Leviathan . Use Ranged and bring Shadow spells to stun the boss. Stun and attack the backside for increased damage.

Pray against his attacks as follows: Blue - Protect from Magic Green - Protect from Missiles Orange - Protect from Melee

As his attacks continue, he speeds up and introduces orange orbs. Hitting him with a shadow spell will slow his attack rate, but also trigger his lightning or debris special attacks.

When the spell lands, it will stun him, you must then shoot his back for bonus damage and prepare for a special attack. (Attacks don't register until the animation comes into contact with your character, therefore standing further away will give you more time to react).

Duke Sucellus [ edit | edit source ]

You will need a pickaxe and a pestle and mortar for this next part. Inside the boss room, you can take an iron pickaxe and a pestle and mortar from the wall next to the vats (near the entrance) when you need them. As soon as you enter the boss room, it's the walls on your right and left.

The Whisperer [ edit | edit source ]

Note: Strange Pools around the undercity can be used to replenish run energy and give the player a stamina potion buff. They can be used infinitely, but are disabled after boss is reached.
