Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Note: If you need to leave Sophanem at any point during the quest, there is a hole you can crawl through on the eastern wall. To get back in, enter the rocks on the east side of the Wanderer's tent. There is a bank in Nardah if needed.

Note: For the pit jump: 20% run energy is required and it will be drained. Higher agility increases the chances of success.

The first flashback [ edit | edit source ]

Warning : You cannot teleport out of this area! There are aggressive Level 84 Mummies scattered throughout the map, and Scarabs that can inflict poison (it is possible to run past the scarabs without taking damage or being poisoned by spam-clicking the minimap). If you need to leave you must walk back to the entrance and use the ladder.

The fourth flashback [ edit | edit source ]

Note: If you equip your catspeak amulet and then talk to your cat about being confused, you will unlock another cutscene! Talking with your cat again about being confused will tell you the story of the quest as it understands it. If asked again, your cat will refuse to explain it again and instead tells you to ask one of your adventuring buddies and the chat option will go away.

Talking to your cat to trigger the cutscene may result in your cat disappearing completely, which will require you to re-log into the game. It may seem like the cat has disappeared completely but it's still with you, just not visible to you.
