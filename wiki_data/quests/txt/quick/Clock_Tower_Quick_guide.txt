Note: When placing the cogs on each respective spindle, merely move your camera so as to be able to see the ends of each spindle. Each spindle has a colour on the end. When ready to place each cog on its respective spindle, all you have to do is look at the ends of the spindles, find the spindle which matches the colour of the cog in your inventory, and use the cog on the corresponding spindle. Players cannot carry more than one cog at a time, regardless of colour.
