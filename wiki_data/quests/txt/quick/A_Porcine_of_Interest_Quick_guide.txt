Description | Ah, the Falador Farm - filled with cabbages, cows, and even a sleepy sheepdog. A peaceful place, where you can learn to churn butter, give a dog a bone, or purchase various Farming supplies. What was once a place of happiness, joy and wholesome dairy goods has of late become dominated by a vile presence.

Can you help her track down... A Porcine of Interest?
