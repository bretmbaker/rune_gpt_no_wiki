Description | Run for your lives...the zombie ogres are here for your flesh! An ogre ceremonial dance area, used to communicate with ancient ogrish ancestors, has been overrun with diseased undead ogres.
How could something like this have happened? And what sort of rewards could an enterprising adventurer gain from exploring the tombs of such a place?

Requirements | Completion of the following quests: Big Chompy Bird Hunting Jungle Potion Druidic Ritual You must be able to defeat a level 111 enemy. 4 Smithing ( boostable ) 8 Herblore ( boostable ) 30 Ranged ( not boostable )

Items required | 5 free inventory spaces are needed to receive items near the start of the quest A comp ogre bow (not needed if using Crumble Undead in final battle) or : Wolf bones Achey logs (obtainable during quest) Knife (obtainable during quest) Axe of your Woodcutting level Bow string Brutal arrows (not needed if using Crumble Undead in final battle) or : Achey logs Knife (obtainable during quest) Nails (the best you can fletch into brutal arrows) Hammer Feathers (4 per 1 brutal arrow)

Recommended | 45 Combat level 43 Prayer for protection prayers 10+ Strength (otherwise it is very difficult to open the chest below the stairs in the north-west corner. Strength boosts are useful here) 30 Fletching ( boostable ) (is needed if you want to create your own Comp ogre bow and 33 Fletching is needed to fletch Brutal arrows .) Strength potion if your strength is low. Opening the ogre tomb seems to require strength and lowers your level each time you fail. Vial of water , Rogue's purse and Snake weed if you choose to learn the technique that allows you to mix Relicym's balm (pretty much necessary if < 89 combat, unless you have sanfew serum). A Sanfew serum would be helpful to prevent disease and restore stats. Relicym's balm is a cheap alternative to the Sanfew serum Ava's accumulator to conserve arrows To save the super restore obtained during the quest to combat disease, combat , ranged , or magic potions can be used after normal restore potions . A ring of dueling to teleport to Castle Wars and Ferox Enclave to restore your stats and cure disease with the pools. A Yanille Teleport
