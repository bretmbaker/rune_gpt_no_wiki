Finishing up [ edit | edit source ]

Note: After completing the quest, return with a rope and use it on each eagle to ride them to their destinations and back. The fastest way back to the transport eagle is by teleporting to Eagle's Eyrie using a necklace of passage which brings you next to the cave with the desert eagle (45 Strength required to push boulder). Riding to each destination from Eagles' Peak will complete medium tasks in the Fremennik, Desert, and Western Provinces Diaries. Additionally, bring a teasing stick , thatching spar , or garden cane to grow the vine for entrance to the jungle eagle 's nest. If you bring one of these three items to grow the vine, make sure you do this last , as you cannot re-enter the jungle eagle 's nest until the vine is grown (takes about 40 minutes).
