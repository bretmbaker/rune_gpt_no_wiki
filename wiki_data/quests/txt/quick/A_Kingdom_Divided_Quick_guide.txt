Description | Great Kourend: a land of wealth, comfort and security. Across its five cities, the people of this Kingdom work to bring peace and prosperity. However, all is not as it seems. Beneath this delicate façade lies an uncomfortable truth: the kingdom of Great Kourend is A Kingdom Divided. Since the death of the last king, Great Kourend has been ruled by the Kourend Council . Under the watchful gaze of the Council, Kourend has enjoyed a golden age of progression. But not all of its citizens are happy, and, spurred by the recent arrest of Councillor Sophia Hughes , allegations of corruption are growing. However, the political games of the Council may be the least of Kourend's concerns. A darker power is gathering in the Kingdom - one that could change the face of Gielinor forever...

League notes | Unlocking Kourend ✓ will auto-complete the quest The book of the dead and the two experience lamps can be claimed by speaking with Commander Fullore . Note: It may be ideal to not claim this too early as the lamps require a skill to be 40+ to be used in. If the book is not needed early on, it may be best in one's interest to hold off until they have a preferred skill or two at 40+, and/or have their preferred Leagues XP multiplier. If inventory space is an issue, the lamps can be safely destroyed and claimed again at a later time.
