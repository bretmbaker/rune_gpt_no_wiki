Ironman concerns | ( ) All seeds needed for the quest can be bought from Olivia in Draynor. Inventory space can be saved by creating the rune dust ahead of time: use the hammer on the rune / pure essence to create rune shards , then use the pestle and mortar on those to create rune dust . The hammer and pestle and mortar can then be safely discarded since they play no further role in the quest.

Gathering seeds [ edit | edit source ]
