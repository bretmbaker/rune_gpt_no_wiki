Description | If you're new to Shilo Village after solving the mystery (or even if you did it some time ago), you may like to check out Yanni Salika's antiques shop. He's a busy chap, revamping antique items, checking out new stock from potential adventurers and maybe he'll have a small (1) favour to ask of you? Probably nothing particularly large, Yanni isn't a demanding (2) person, should hardly take you any time (3) at all really, something to do when you have a spare moment. That's assuming there aren't any complications. 1: - Perception of the word "small" may be open to interpretation. 2: - In a recent vote, Yanni Salika was only voted the second most demanding person in Shilo Village. 3: - As everyone knows, time is relative.
