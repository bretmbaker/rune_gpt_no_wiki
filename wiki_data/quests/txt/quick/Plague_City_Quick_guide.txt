Ironman concerns | The hangover cure can be made before the quest starts by combining milk, chocolate dust, and snape grass to conserve inventory space. The hangover cure itself is an untradeable item so if preparing for Group Ironman, do not premake these as you will be unable to share them with your group through Group Storage or Trading.
