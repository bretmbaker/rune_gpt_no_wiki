Description | After you foiled a plan to destroy the Grand Tree things have been quiet in the gnome world. Brimstail has found a strange machine, though, built by Oaknock the Engineer during the Gnomes' Golden Age. What does the weird device do? Why on Gielinor was it built? If you agree to help this bookworm gnome get this confusing device working, you will learn a little about gnome magicks, gnome history, and you will start to uncover a new threat (or is it an old one?) to gnome security - a threat that is a lot harder to see ...

Requirements | Completed The Grand Tree quest 5 Construction ( not boostable ) 46 Magic ( not boostable ) ( not required to start )

Recommended | Several free inventory slots (about 8) to solve the puzzles more easily Fast travel to the Tree Gnome Stronghold ( Balloon Transport System , Gnome Glider , Spirit Tree or Slayer Ring to the Slayer Cave to directly reach the Stronghold -- alternatively, use a Necklace of Passage to the Outpost and walk north) Fast travel to Hazelmere ( Fairy rings to C L S , or Watchtower or Nightmare Zone minigame teleport and walk east if you have no access to fairy rings) Slayer ring to the Slayer Dungeon or a Necklace of Passage to the Wizards' Tower for easy access to fairy rings

Enemies to defeat | 6 x Evil creature that each have 1 HP

Ironman concerns | For mud runes, either 13 Runecraft to create them, 42 Hunter to catch essence implings, or 33 Magic to earn points at the Mage Training Arena . 45 Woodcutting recommended to cut Maple logs . Magic glue can be made before starting the quest by grinding the mud rune with the pestle and mortar and using it on a bucket of sap , saving inventory space.
