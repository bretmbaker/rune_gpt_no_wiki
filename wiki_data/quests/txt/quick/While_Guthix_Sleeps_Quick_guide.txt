Description | This Grandmaster quest sees you continue the Mahjarrat storyline, hunting down one of the most powerful artefacts in existence while ensuring it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. This artefact is known by many names – most recently, the Stone of Jas. It has shaped the course of Gielinor’s history, from the creation of the first Runes to the fall of Zaros. It was last seen at the devastating end of the God Wars, when Zamorak, in a fit of rage, used it to reduce the land of Forinthry to the Wilderness we know today. Angered by Zamorak’s actions, Guthix rose from his age-long slumber and banished the gods. He hid the Stone of Jas far underground, where it could never disturb the balance again... But while Guthix sleeps, nefarious forces have been gathering: the Mahjarrat. Shaped by war and deadly ritual, their plans for the Stone can only lead to catastrophe. Facing off against the Mahjarrat is nothing new for dedicated adventurers – at every turn, they seem to grow in power and wage war against the people of Gielinor. In their last attempt, we saw them set out to tear Varrock apart with an undead army in Defender of Varrock. What are they plotting now?
