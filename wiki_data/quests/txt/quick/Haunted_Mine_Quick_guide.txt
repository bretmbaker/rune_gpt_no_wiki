Description | Recent forays into Morytania by some of Saradomin's more fanatical supporters have unearthed murky rumours concerning an abandoned mine in the south.
Legend speaks of an unusual material, hidden in the depths of the mines, that is somehow linked to the desolation and fear that now surrounds the place. Do you have the nerve to find out more, and enter the haunted mines of Morytania?

Treus Dayth accessible in the Nightmare Zone .

Additional tips [ edit | edit source ]

Players can use a ball of wool on a salve shard to make a salve amulet . The crystal-mine key , obtained after killing Treus Dayth , can be added to the steel key ring . Unless the player has a low defence or prayer level, it is often more efficient to tank the crane hits and rush the boss directly than it is to spend time navigating the area. Mining mithril ore within the abandoned mine is a hard task in the Morytania Diary . You can receive a pickaxe by attempting to take one of the pickaxes lying on the ground near the bottom of the lift, which will come to life (level 50) before dropping an Iron Pickaxe . There is also a spawn of a bronze pickaxe at the top of the lift, just to the west.
