Trivia [ edit | edit source ]

While waiting to clean bones, players may examine skeletons surrounding the Odd Old Man's house. One such skeleton states "What a waste of prayer xp!". Rag and Bone Man II was formerly a miniquest named "Rag & Bone Wish List". As miniquests do not usually give quest points, it was renamed Rag and Bone Man II and reclassified as a quest in an update on 17 August 2017 .
