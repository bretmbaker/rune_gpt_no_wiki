Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

Note: You must keep your seal of passage , once obtained, on you at all times while on the Lunar Isle . If you do not, you will be teleported off of the isle if you try to talk to any NPC .

The lantern given during the quest does not come with oil in it, so bring a lightable regular bullseye lantern . If you put the emerald lens in the given lantern, drop it and ask for a new lens, which you then use on your working brought bullseye lantern.
