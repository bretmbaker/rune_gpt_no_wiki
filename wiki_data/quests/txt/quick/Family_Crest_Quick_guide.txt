Rewards [ edit | edit source ]

1 Quest point Steel gauntlets The steel gauntlets offer useful perks. Each brother will imbue them with a special ability. They will initially do this for free. Be careful choosing, though, since you can only have one effect, and it will cost you 25,000 coins to change them. Dimintheis will provide you with a "magically" found pair should you lose them.
