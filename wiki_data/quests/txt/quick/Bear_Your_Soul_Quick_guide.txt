Bear Your Soul is a miniquest that involves the player searching for a damaged ancient artefact that is mentioned in a book.

During the miniquest, players will require a spade and a method to reach Cerberus' Lair within the Taverley Dungeon . Players thus need a dusty key if they do not have at least level 70 in Agility (can be boosted with a Summer pie from 65). Alternatively, players who have Key master teleports can teleport directly to Cerberus' Lair.
