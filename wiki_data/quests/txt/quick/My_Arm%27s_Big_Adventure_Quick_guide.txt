Description | Trolls love goutweed. They love it so much that they've picked it all, and now they can't get any more.

Can you teach his young assistant - a simple troll known as My Arm - to grow the precious goutweed? Will you overcome My Arm's stubbornness and ignorance to earn yourself Burntmeat's reward?
