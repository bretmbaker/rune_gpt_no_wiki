Deep within the desert, an ancient tomb has long hidden a great power – and The Devourer is determined to harness it at any cost. If she succeeds, all hope is lost.

Walkthrough [ edit | edit source ]

The miniquest begins by talking to Maisa at the Jaltevas Pyramid at the Necropolis .

After entering the pyramid, a small cutscene will ensue, with Maisa giving the player a journal and then tasking the player on freeing the lesser gods, Apmeken , Crondis , Het , and Scabaras in the Tombs of Amascut . Players need to complete a full run of the Tombs of Amascut in order to proceed with the miniquest. A strategy guide can be found here . Players wanting to obtain the ancient key after the miniquest should loot the big banana , Eldritch ashes , fang , and scarab dung dropped by each demi-boss respectively.

After players defeat the demi-bosses within the tombs to release Amascut's hold on the lesser gods, players must proceed to the lower levels of the tombs, where Amascut is found to have activated Elidinis' and Tumeken's Warden . After both Wardens have been defeated, players will find themselves in Osmumten 's burial chamber, where his spirit can also be found. Osmumten will commend players on their victory over Amascut after defeating the Wardens, but also warns that Amascut's forces will be back again and that the player's help within the tombs is still needed.

Players can teleport to the tombs' lobby after claiming their rewards, where the lesser gods can be found and talked to to learn some of their backstory. Players should then talk to Maisa in the lobby, speculating whether Amascut has gone to Menaphos and is now reconsidering her plans. She will then reward players with an antique lamp and walk away to help the lesser gods.

Rewards [ edit | edit source ]

An antique lamp giving 50,000 experience to any combat skill that is at least level 60, excluding Prayer . Ability to obtain the ancient key .
