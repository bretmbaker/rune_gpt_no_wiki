Item: Desiccated page
Summary: Desiccated pages are an untradeable item obtained as loot from the Royal Titans. Players can obtain them commonly as regular loot, but can also guarantee[note] obtaining them via their right-click "Take pages" option; tertiary loot (such as Bran and clue scrolls) are still rolled as normal.
