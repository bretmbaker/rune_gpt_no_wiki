Item: Glacial temotli
Summary: Glacial temotli are a two-handed weapon that requires level 55 Attack to wield, obtained as a rare drop from Frost Nagua and Amoxliatl in the Ruins of Tapoyauik. Like its slash equivalent, the sulphur blades, the weapon performs two independently rolled hits per attack. The maximum damage of each hit is determined by calculating the combined max hit as normal and dividing it by two. If the combined max hit is odd, one max hit is rounded up while the other is rounded down (e.g., 45 â†’ 22 + 23).
