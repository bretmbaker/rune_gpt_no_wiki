Item: Shadow Realm
Summary: The Shadow Realm is a realm that is, in some sense, a hidden part of Gielinor rather than a separate dimension. It forms an invisible layer of reality seemingly spanning the entire world. Objects and people that are inside the Shadow Realm are normally not visible to people outside of it, although it is still possible to see them using a ring of visibility or a ring of shadows. Some beings, such as certain Gods and Mahjarrat, are also able to see things hiding in the Shadow Realm, seemingly without any external aid.
