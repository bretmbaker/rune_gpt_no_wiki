Item: Dragon 2h sword
Summary: The dragon 2h sword is one of the strongest two-handed swords in Old School RuneScape, requiring level 60 Attack to wield. Due to its slow attacking speed and the fact that it cannot be used with a shield or defender, many players prefer using other dragon weaponry instead, such as the dragon scimitar.
