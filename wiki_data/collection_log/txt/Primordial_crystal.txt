Item: Primordial crystal
Summary: The primordial crystal is an add-on dropped by Cerberus. When used with a pair of dragon boots, primordial boots will be created. This process cannot be reversed, and requires level 60 in Runecraft and Magic (boosts cannot be used), granting 200 experience in both skills.
