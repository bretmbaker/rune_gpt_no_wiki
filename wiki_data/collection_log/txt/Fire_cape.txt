Item: Fire cape
Summary: The fire cape is a melee cape obtained as a reward for completing the TzHaar Fight Cave. It is the second best melee cape in the game, outclassed only by the infernal cape.
In order to obtain the fire cape, players must survive all waves of TzHaar Fight Caves and defeat TzTok-Jad. Note that the cape will not be awarded should both the player and TzTok-Jad die simultaneously, even though the boss log will count the kill. The player must be taken out of the cave by the game recognising TzTok-Jad's death; if they are removed from the cave due to dying, the game considers the player to have failed the challenge.
