Item: Abyssal head
Summary: An abyssal head is a rare drop from abyssal demons, requiring 85 Slayer to kill. Players may also obtain an abyssal head by placing an unsired at the Font of Consumption; this has a 5/64 chance, and as an unsired is a 1/100 drop, this effectively makes it a 1/1,280 drop per Abyssal Sire kill.
