Item: Hill giant club
Summary: The hill giant club is a two-handed melee weapon requiring 40 Attack to equip. It is currently the best-in-slot weapon for crush bonuses in free-to-play, possessing very similar stats to a rune 2h sword but with the slash and crush bonuses swapped, though the rune 2h sword has a slightly higher slash bonus than the crush bonus of the club.
