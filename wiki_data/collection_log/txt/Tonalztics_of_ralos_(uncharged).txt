Item: Tonalztics of ralos
Summary: The Tonalztics of Ralos is a one-handed thrown weapon that requires level 75 Ranged to equip, which is obtained by participating in the Fortis Colosseum. Unlike most thrown weapons, it is not stackable and effectively provides unlimited "ammo," though it has an additional effect when charged. The weapon rolls against a monster's light ranged defence.
