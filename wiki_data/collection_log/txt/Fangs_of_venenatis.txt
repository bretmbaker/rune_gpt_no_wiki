Item: Fangs of venenatis
Summary: The fangs of Venenatis are an item dropped by Venenatis. They are used to upgrade Craw's bow into a webweaver bow. This process requires level 85 Fletching; players without the required level to combine the items may ask Derse Venator in Ferox Enclave to do so instead, for a fee of 500,000 coins. The uncharged weapon may be dismantled to separate the bow and fangs.
