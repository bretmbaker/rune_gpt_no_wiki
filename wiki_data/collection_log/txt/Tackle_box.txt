Item: Tackle box
Summary: The tackle box can be obtained from fishing at the reward pool with the reward permits gained from subduing Tempoross. The tackle box can be used to store various fishing equipment. It is not possible to use the items whilst they are in the tackle box; for example, players must still have a fishing rod and Sandworms in their inventory to fish Anglerfish even if they have a tackle box with the items stored in their inventory. You cannot store items in noted form.
