When worn, there is a 25% chance for aSlayer taskkill to not count as a kill towards it, but still granting the appropriate Slayer experience (excludingTzTok-JadandTzKal-Zuk). This results in Slayer tasks lasting 33.3% longer on average. This effect is the inverse of theexpeditious braceletseffect.
