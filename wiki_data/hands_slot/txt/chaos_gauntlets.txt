The gauntlets, when worn, increase the maximum damage done by allbolt spellsby 3 (before the boosted damage is multiplied byMagic Damagestats), thus making the max hit of bolt spells only 1 below that ofblast spells. There are no requirements to wear these gloves.
These gloves can first be obtained by bringingsteel gauntletstoJohnathon, one of the sons in the Family Crest quest. Johnathon is located upstairs in theJolly Boar Inn, which is north-east ofVarrock. If you bring the steel gauntlets to Johnathon (and they have already been imbued with another power) you must bring 25,000coinsto change them.
