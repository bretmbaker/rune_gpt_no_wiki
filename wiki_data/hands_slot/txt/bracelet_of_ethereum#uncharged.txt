Players can configure the charges while the bracelet is in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials. When charged, the bracelet becomes untradeable and damage from revenants is reduced by 75%, with 1 charge being consumed per attack. Revenants are also made tolerant when a charged bracelet is worn.
It isalwayslost on death, and any ether stored within it will be dropped as well. Thus, it is recommended not to place too many charges in the bracelet, as player killers will always receive the remaining ether within it as loot upon death.
