[Weapon: Steel Gauntlets]


Steel gauntletsare a reward for completing theFamily Crestquest and an heirloom of the Fitzharmon family. Players can take them to any of the three brothers from the quest and have them enchant the gauntlets with a special ability. The magic of these gauntlets will always return them to the head of the Fitzharmon house should they be lost, so if a player loses the gauntlets, they can be retrieved fromDimintheiswith their previous enchantment.
Before completion of theFamily Pestminiquest, players can only have one pair of gauntlets at a time. After completing the miniquest,Dimintheiswill hand the player as many pairs of steel gauntlets as they want for free.
