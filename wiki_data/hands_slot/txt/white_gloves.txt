[Weapon: White Gloves]


Thewhite glovesare a type ofWhite Knight equipmentthat requires 10Defenceand the completion of theWanted!questto wield. Using these gloves is generally impractical (unless the +1Prayer bonusis needed) as most other gloves have higher defence bonuses. White gloves are the only piece of white equipment to not have the same defensive/offensive stats as itsblack counterpart.
