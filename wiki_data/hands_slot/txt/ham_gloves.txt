[Weapon: Ham Gloves]


H.A.M. glovesare part of theH.A.M. robesuniform worn byHumans Against Monstersmembers. When worn, players are slightly less likely to be kicked out of theH.A.M. HideoutwhenpickpocketingH.A.M. members; this effect increases the more H.A.M uniform pieces the player wears. Wearing H.A.M. gloves will not increase players chances of successfully pickpocketing.[1]
These can be obtained bythievingH.A.M. members or by killingH.A.M. guards. H.A.M. Clothing is usually worn for show, although they are a requirement for theDeath to the Dorgeshuunquest.
