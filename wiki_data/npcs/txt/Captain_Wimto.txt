Item: Captain Wimto
Summary: Captain Wimto was an unreleased gnome glider pilot. He was first added to the cache with the release of Tortoises, along with four other gnome pilots, in preparation for the release of the Gnome Restaurant minigame. However, when the minigame was eventually released later that year, although the four other pilots were released to replace the original Gnome pilot NPC, Captain Wimto was not added. Most likely, he was meant to be stationed at the Digsite gnome glider, since the original pilot there was not updated.
