Item: Silk trader
Summary: The silk trader can be found north of the Al Kharid palace. He provides a slow but reliable way for newer members to gain some money. If the player is prepared to click through a lengthy dialogue, they can buy some silk for just 3 coins, which may then be sold for a small profit at any general store excluding the general store in Al Kharid. It is also possible to sell it at the Grand Exchange for a bigger profit.
