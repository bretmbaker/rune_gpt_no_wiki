Item: Wally
Summary: Wally is one of Varrock's most famous heroes. When the powerful demon Delrith attempted to destroy the city, Wally narrowly managed to defeat him with the sword Silverlight in the 19th year of the Fifth Age, 150 years ago. He died sometime after, and has since been largely forgotten. His battle with Delrith is shown to the player by Aris during Demon Slayer.
