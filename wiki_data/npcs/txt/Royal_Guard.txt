Item: Royal Guard
Summary: The Kourend Royal Guard are the elite guard who protect and serve the ruler of Great Kourend. While the armour they wear suggests that they are a branch of the Shayzien Army, the Royal Guard are a separate entity and directly serves the kingdom's ruler.[1] They are currently lead by Commander Lydia Fullore, who ensures that they are well trained and supplied.[2]
