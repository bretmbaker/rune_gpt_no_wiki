Item: Anwen
Summary: Anwen is the owner of the silk stall in Prifddinas. She can be found in the north-east section of the city, near the other stalls. Like the Silk merchant in East Ardougne, she will buy silk from the player for 60 coins each, as long as the player has not stolen from her stall recently. Choose the 120 coin option she offers, then offer to sell it for 60 when she suggests 50.
