Item: Estate agent
Summary: Estate agents are NPCs that sell players land to build Player-owned houses (POH) on, as well as decorating them and/or moving them. These agents can be found in several major cities: Varrock, Falador, Seers' Village, East Ardougne, Hosidius, and Varlamore as well as Alwyn taking up the role in the Ithell district of Prifddinas. They are identified on the minimap by a symbol of a small house (). Players may either pay 1,000 coins or complete the quest Daddy's Home to get their first house in Rimmington. With a house you are able to start training the Construction skill.
