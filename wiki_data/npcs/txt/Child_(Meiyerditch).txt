Item: Child (Meiyerditch)
Summary: A Meiyerditch Child is any young resident of Meiyerditch, a ghetto city of the Sanguinesti region. Meiyerditch children can be found in great numbers throughout the city, though, like all of the populace, they will shy away from the player if spoken to and act very afraid. If pressed, however, they will share what they know of The Myreque, Meiyerditch, and the Drakans. They are an option to ask people about the Myreque during the Darkness of Hallowvale quest.
