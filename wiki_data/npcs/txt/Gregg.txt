Item: Gregg
Summary: Gregg the Rabbit is the main character in the 2021 Easter event, who is fed up with being called a cute rabbit every year, and only being associated with Easter. So, he invents "Eastdoor" as an alternative event to distract from his cuteness. Despite his efforts, he gets called "cute" everywhere he goes while on this quest to decorate a door, though.
