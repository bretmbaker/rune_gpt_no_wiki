Item: Zandar Horfyre
Summary: Zandar Horfyre is a dark wizard found on the top floor of the Dark Wizards' Tower, west of Falador. The fastest way to get there is to teleport to the Crafting Guild using the Skills necklace, then go north. Alternatively, Watchtower Teleport to Yanille and use the southern portal on the 2nd floor[UK]3rd floor[US] of the Wizards' Guild, requiring 66 Magic (boostable) to enter, or take the Agility shortcut over the crumbling wall by the west Falador bank and go south-west.
