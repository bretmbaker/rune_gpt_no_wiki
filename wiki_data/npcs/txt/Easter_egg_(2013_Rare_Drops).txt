Item: Easter egg (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The easter egg was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with an easter egg. This was the first introduction of the easter egg in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Easter holiday events.
