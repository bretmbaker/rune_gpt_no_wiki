Item: Conwenna
Summary: Conwenna is a citizen of Prifddinas, and an expert on crystal singing. She can be found near the singing bowl on the west side of the city, where she offers to sing crystal items into being for the player, at the cost of some crystal shards. Asking Conwenna to sing on the player's behalf will unlock a convenient Sing menu option for both her and Reese.
