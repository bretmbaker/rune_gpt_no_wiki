Item: Karamthulhu (unused pet)
Summary: The karamthulhu is an unreleased pet that was created by Mod Wilson during development of the Rum Deal quest, but was held back so it could be released as part of the planned Summoning skill instead. Wilson reportedly took the pet with him to tests of some of the multiplayer content that was in development at the time, such as Pest Control.[1] While not intended to launch until later, the follower NPC was nevertheless added to the live game alongside Rum Deal.
