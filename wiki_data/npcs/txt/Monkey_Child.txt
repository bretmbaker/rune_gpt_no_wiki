Item: Monkey Child
Summary: The Monkey Child is a small monkey found on the remote island of Ape Atoll. He can be found wandering in the garden close to his aunt and uncle. He takes an enormous and vital role in the Monkey Madness I quest, in which he lets the player, who he mistakes for his 'uncle,' "borrow" a monkey talisman, used to create a monkey greegree. In exchange for the talisman, he asks for 20 bananas. He cannot count, however, and will sometimes accept as few as 4 and, at most, 10 bananas.
