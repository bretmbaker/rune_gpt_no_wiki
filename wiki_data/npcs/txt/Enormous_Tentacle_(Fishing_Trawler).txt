Item: Enormous Tentacle (Fishing Trawler)
Summary: An Enormous Tentacle regularly attacks the trawler boat during the Fishing Trawler minigame, causing the boat's rail to be broken. When it appears, a chatbox message will state: The Kraken is attacking!. It can be chopped at using an axe, to chase it away. The chance to successfully chop at the kraken's tentacle depends on the axe being used and the player's Woodcutting level.[1][2] This rewards 5 Woodcutting experience per successful chop, as well as 10 trawler contribution points. A blessed axe cannot be used, and the infernal axe, crystal axe, and all felling axes will behave as a normal axe and not use charges or forester's rations.
