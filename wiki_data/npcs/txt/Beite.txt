Item: Beite
Summary: Beite is the child of Bob and Neite that was planned to appear in a cutscene in the A Tail of Two Cats quest. Due to the quest developer resigning before the quest could be completed, the cutscene was never implemented, leaving Beite and the other NPCs that were intended to appear in the cutscene unused within the game cache.[1]
