Item: Turgall
Summary: Turgall is a cave goblin who works the Dorgesh-Kaan electricity and the Agility course. Turgall is located in the building east down the stairs (not the ladder) from the entrance of the Dorgesh-Kaan Agility Course. He will ask players to retrieve a part from the old power generator across the chasm, which can only be accessed via a series of Agility obstacles. Players must return one of the requested parts to him in order to successfully complete a lap.
