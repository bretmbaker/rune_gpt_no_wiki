Item: Ghost (Hopespear)
Summary: Hopespear (known simply as ghost in-game) is the name of an ancient goblin prophet who fought alongside the Narogoshuun tribe at the Battle of Plain of Mud in the Fourth Age. During the battle, in which eleven out of the twelve Goblin Tribes (exception being the Dorgeshuun) fought, Hopespear had a vision of the Big High War God and gathered the leaders of the warring goblin tribes, telling them to stop the battle as their god would one day send a Chosen Commander to lead the goblins to victory.
