Item: Ellis
Summary: Ellis is the tanner located in Al Kharid, in the building just north of the furnace. He offers players his tanning service for a small fee per item. Because of his close proximity to a bank, it is common for players to purchase leather and dragonhides, have Ellis tan them, then sell the tanned leathers and dragonhides for a profit. This makes it a good way for players to make money where no skills are required.
