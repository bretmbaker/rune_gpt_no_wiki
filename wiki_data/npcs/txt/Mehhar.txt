Item: Mehhar
Summary: Mehhar, son of Osmumten, is encountered during the Beneath Cursed Sands quest in the Scabaras Dungeon. Following the Kharidianâ€“Zarosian War in the mid-Second Age, a group of Menaphites blamed Osmumten for the great losses and eventually killed Osmumten and the royal family save for Mehhar,[1] who was brought to safety in Ullek by some of the family's servants.[2] Mehhar remained in exile in Ullek, where he devoted himself to the teachings of Scabaras, founding the Sect of Scabaras.[3] After his death he was buried in a tomb in Ullek.
