Item: Head mourner (removed)
Summary: The head mourner was the chief of the Mourners. He was employed by King Lathas to contain the supposed plague in West Ardougne. After he learned Elena was investigating West Ardougne for details of the plague, allegedly brought on by the return of King Tyras, he ordered her imprisonment for fear she would learn the truth, that the "plague" was a conspiracy used as pretence to hide Ardougne's military activity in the ongoing war in the western lands. The Head Mourner then tried to gain access to the Temple of Light, but was foiled by an adventurer during Mourning's End Part I and II. He could be found in his office in north-eastern West Ardougne. If players lose or drop the key provided during the quest, you may search his desk for a replacement.
