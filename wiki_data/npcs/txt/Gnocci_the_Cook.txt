Item: Gnocci the Cook
Summary: Gnocci the Cook is one of Captain Tock's crew members who have moored in Corsair Cove after supposedly being cursed. He fished up a 'possessed doll' while trying to fish for lobsters, though it is later revealed that it was only a clockwork doll. He excuses himself by saying it's an "easy mistake to make!".
