Item: Femi
Summary: Femi is a gnome who plays a role in The Grand Tree quest. She can be found outside of the gate leading into the Tree Gnome Stronghold. Prior receiving the lumber order during The Grand Tree, when attempting to enter the gate to the Tree Gnome Stronghold for the first time, Femi will ask the player if they can help load some boxes into her cart. If the player helps load the boxes, she will smuggle the player in to the Tree Gnome Stronghold for free when they are stopped from entering during The Grand Tree. If she wasn't helped with loading her boxes, she will require a fee of 1,000 coins to be smuggled in during the quest.
