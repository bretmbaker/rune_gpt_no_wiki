Item: Nylocas (A Night at the Theatre)
Summary: A Nylocas can be seen in a cutscene during A Night at the Theatre. It is revealed through a memory that Verzik Vitur attempted to create a very powerful Nylocas through a breeding program. By cross-breeding a nylocas from her homeworld Vampyrium with a Gielinorian araxyte, Verzik created this new variant which she calls the Queen Nylocas.
