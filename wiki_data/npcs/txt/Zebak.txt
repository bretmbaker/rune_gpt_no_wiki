Item: Zebak
Summary: Zebak is a large crocodile encountered at the end of the Path of Crondis, within the Tombs of Amascut raid. As the strongest crocodile with an ever growing hunger, Zebak accepted an offer by Amascut to lure Crondis in return for endless supply of food; however, he was instead cursed to an eternal life without being able to eat while guarding his former god in the tombs.
