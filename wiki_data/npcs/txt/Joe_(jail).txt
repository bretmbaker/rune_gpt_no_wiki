Item: Joe (jail)
Summary: Joe is Lady Keli's talkative head bodyguard in the jail east of Draynor Village. During the Prince Ali Rescue quest, the player must incapacitate him so they can then tie up Lady Keli and rescue Prince Ali. This is done by getting him drunk on beer. To do this, use three beers on him until he gets too drunk to guard the prince. Prince Ali can then be rescued if the player has the correct materials, namely some rope and a bronze key. Should the player attempt to tie up Lady Keli before Joe is drunk, he will intervene.
