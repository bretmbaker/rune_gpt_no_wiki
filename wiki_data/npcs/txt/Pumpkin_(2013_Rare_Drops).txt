Item: Pumpkin (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The pumpkin was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a pumpkin. This was the first introduction of the pumpkin in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Halloween holiday events. The spawns were available for one week.
