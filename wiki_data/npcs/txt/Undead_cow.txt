Item: Undead cow
Summary: Undead cows can be found west of Port Phasmatys in Morytania near the Farming allotment. As their name suggests, they are undead, so a salve amulet or a salve amulet (e) is effective to deal more melee damage. They can be killed for both cow and zombie slayer tasks. They respawn relatively quickly, so killing them may be an efficient way to complete unwanted slayer tasks. They are sometimes killed for their bones for the Ectofuntus, most commonly during Ghosts Ahoy and Animal Magnetism.
