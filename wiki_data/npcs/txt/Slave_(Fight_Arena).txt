Item: Slave (Fight Arena)
Summary: Slaves are present at the Fight Arena, a small settlement situated in southern Kandarin. Slave fighters are innocent prisoners taken from townships and villages around the region and forced to fight, very often to the death, with each other and ferocious beasts such as Ogres and giant scorpions, for the amusement of the young Mahjarrat warlord General Khazard. Slaves play a very minor role in the Fight Arena quest, being imprisoned alongside Justin and Sammy Servil in the prison.
