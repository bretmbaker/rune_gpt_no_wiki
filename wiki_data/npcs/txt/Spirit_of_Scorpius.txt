Item: Spirit of Scorpius
Summary: The Spirit of Scorpius is a Zamorakian ghost.[1] After completion of Observatory Quest, he will give the player an unholy mould and bless unholy symbols. He is found south-west of Ardougne by the Grave of Scorpius, due north of the Observatory. An unholy mould must be claimed from him before he will bless any unholy symbols. He will not give the player an unholy mould if there is one already in their inventory.
