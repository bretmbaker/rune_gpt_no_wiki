Item: Red h'ween Mask (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The red h'ween mask was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a red halloween mask. The spawns were available for one week and dropped at the same time as the blue and green masks. This was the first introduction of halloween masks in Old School RuneScape, though they were later made available as part of the annual Halloween holiday events.
