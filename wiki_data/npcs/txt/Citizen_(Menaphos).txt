Item: Citizen (Menaphos)
Summary: Citizens are people of Menaphos under the control of Amascut. The citizens are hypnotised to tirelessly excavate the Necropolis as part of Amascut's plot. If talked to they will all repeat the same phrase. During Beneath Cursed Sands the player obtains an incantation from the ghost of Mehhar, which allows them to free the entranced citizens. After being rescued two citizens will remain at the necropolis to help clear the collapsed entrance to Jaltevas Pyramid eventually allowing access to Tombs of Amascut.
