Item: Randivor
Summary: Randivor runs Keldagrim's Best Bread in Keldagrim, a stall operated in Keldagrim's eastern marketplace. Although players with level 5 Thieving can steal from his stall and earn 16 experience upon success, this method is strongly not recommended due to rapid attack from the Black Guards if caught and a slow respawn timer of nine seconds, which is significantly slower than the Ardougne Baker's Stall..
