Item: Helpful Spirit
Summary: The Helpful Spirit, whose name is Akila, appears in the Nexus of the Tombs of Amascut. He offers supplies to players twice throughout the raid: once after completing any two paths, and once again after completing the remaining two paths and before proceeding to the final encounter. He offers three bundles of supplies, of which one may be picked; Life (survival), Chaos (mix of Life and Power) and Power (pure damage). In addition, he cannot be used to hold supplies - if the player tries to enter the next area without collecting the supplies from him, they will be warned that if they proceed items the spirit would offer will be forfeited.
