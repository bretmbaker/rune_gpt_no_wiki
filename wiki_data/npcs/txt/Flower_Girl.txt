Item: Flower Girl
Summary: The Flower Girl is a Miscellanian girl located in the Miscellania's castle courtyard, which functions as a market for the island kingdom. She makes her living from selling sets of red, yellow, and blue flowers for the price of 15 coins each, which is useful if you need flowers for the Throne of Miscellania quest. However, the only type of flowers she gives are the mixed variant and you can only buy one at a time when talking to her. This creates a slow process of buying many of these flowers. Purchasing flowers gains the player 0.4% Managing Miscellania approval on each purchase.[1]
