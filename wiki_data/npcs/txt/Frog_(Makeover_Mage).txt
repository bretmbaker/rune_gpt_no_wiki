Item: Frog (Makeover Mage)
Summary: A Frog is found inside the Makeover Mage's house. It is likely there to serve as a joke, referring to the trope of fairy tales referring to people being turned into frogs when something goes wrong when using transforming magic on humans, such as the Grimm's fairy tale The Frog Prince.
