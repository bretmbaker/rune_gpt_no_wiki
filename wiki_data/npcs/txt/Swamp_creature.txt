Item: Swamp creature
Summary: The Swamp creature appears in the Temple Trekking minigame during the boat trip of route 3. It consists of five parts, a level 140 head and four level 99 tentacles. The tentacles can hit anywhere on the boat, but will usually only attack the player's follower when the follower is directly in front of one of the swamp creature parts. Poisoning one part poisons all parts. If the head is near death and a tentacle is still alive, it will return to full health. The Head can hit very hard, but doesn't often and is also very slow. It is recommended to kill the part attacking your follower first, but not get too close to the head.
