Item: Skeleton outfit (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The skeleton outfit was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a skeleton mask, shirt, leggings, gloves, and boots. The spawns were available for one week and dropped at the same time as the jack lantern mask. This was the first introduction of skeleton outfit in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Halloween holiday events.
