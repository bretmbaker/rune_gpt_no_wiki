Item: Chaeldar
Summary: Chaeldar is the fourth most-advanced Slayer master in RuneScape. She is found in the throne room of Zanaris, directly south of the entrance from the Lumbridge Swamp, meaning completion of the Lost City quest is required to reach her. She gives out mid to high level Slayer tasks, which may only be attempted by players with a combat level of at least 70.
