Item: Oracle
Summary: The Oracle is a strange woman who lives atop Ice Mountain. She is an important figure in the Dragon Slayer I quest, as she provides a clue as to how to access one of the map pieces. Occasionally, she will be visited by Postie Pete. One of the Wise Old Man's tasks involves taking a message to her. To reach Oracle, use the Ice Mountain pathway just below Edgeville Monastery.
