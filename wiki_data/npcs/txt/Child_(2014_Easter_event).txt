Item: Child (2014 Easter event)
Summary: Children appeared during the 2014 Easter event, outside the Easter Bunny's burrow, found south-west of Falador. They lamented that they could not get any chocolate eggs, and chased the hypnotised rabbits around in an attempt to gain some eggs. Players were instructed by the Easter Bunny to give them 10 easter eggs, and giving them magic easter eggs turned them into rabbits for a few seconds. They were also impressed when players turn into a rabbit or egg.
