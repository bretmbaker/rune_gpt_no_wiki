Item: Mountain goat
Summary: Mountain goats are animals that can be in the mountains around Troll Country, specifically the top of Trollheim; south of Mount Quidamortem; the cliff overlooking Death Plateau; around the ice troll settlement of Weiss; and inside a cage in the troll kitchen, ready to be cooked (although Burntmeat the troll cook prefers to cook humans if he gets the chance).
