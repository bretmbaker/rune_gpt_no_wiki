Item: Peer the Seer
Summary: Peer the Seer is found south of the Rellekka market. He votes for the player to be allowed to join the Fremennik tribe during The Fremennik Trials quest, if they can pass his test. As his test requires the player not bring any items, he will offer to deposit all the player's held and equipped items into their bank if they speak to him during the quest. After the quest, he will tell the player their future, mainly on what skill to train that day. Despite the Fremennik tribe's hostility toward magic users, Peer himself uses magic to aid the player in both quests he is a part of.
