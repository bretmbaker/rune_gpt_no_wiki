Item: Fairy Nuff
Summary: Fairy Nuff is a fairy physician in Zanaris, found in her house north of the bank. She graduated from PoxStead College over 200 years ago and apparently studied advanced healing under Dr Foster while there. Her job is to take care of sick and wounded fairies in Zanaris, although, as they are a magical race and don't get hurt very often, she claims to often not have much to do.
