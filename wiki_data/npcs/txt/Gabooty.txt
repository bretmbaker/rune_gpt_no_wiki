Item: Gabooty
Summary: Gabooty is one of the natives in Tai Bwo Wannai Village, a small village located on Karamja. He wanders around inside the village walls and acts as the village store. In order to see him you need to have completed the quest Jungle Potion. Both stores can only be used after asking Gabooty what he does around there, after which they will be unlocked for future right-click use. Unlike regular stores, Gabooty uses trading sticks for currency, which can be earned in the Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup minigame. All prices for both his stores can be reduced with the completion of the easy tasks on the Karamja Diary, assuming the gloves are worn when talking to him. Gabooty also hands out trading sticks to players who have the appropriate favour percentage and who have not asked him for sticks in a while.
