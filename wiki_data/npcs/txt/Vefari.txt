Item: Vefari
Summary: Vefari is a member of the Sisterhood that can be found in a secret room in the Morytania Spider Cave. She is part of a series of tunnels that require multiple drops from Araxxor to navigate, ultimately leading to a man that will change a player's amulet of rancour into an ornamented silver version. Players must wear an araxyte slayer helmet in order to progress to the next room where Arancini is found.
