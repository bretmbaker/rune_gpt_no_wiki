Item: Mourner (Mourner Tunnels)
Summary: Mourners are encountered in the Mourner Tunnels during the Mourning's End quests. Unlike other mourners, they are entirely non-interactive and cannot be fought or spoken to. They can be distinguished from other mourners by the Crystal halberds they wield, and their slightly lighter clothing.
