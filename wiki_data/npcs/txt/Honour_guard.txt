Item: Honour guard
Summary: Honour guards are unattackable NPCs with a combat level of 115. They assist the player in killing 10 ice trolls in the final battle of The Fremennik Isles, and are also found wandering around the front gates of Neitiznot. They are also found in the icy areas north of the main village of Neitiznot, usually fighting ice troll runts. These Ice troll runts will not drop anything when killed by Honour guards unless the player inflicts at least one hitpoint of damage. They are good for Ranged training as they make perfect solid blockades and can provide extra muscle when needed.
