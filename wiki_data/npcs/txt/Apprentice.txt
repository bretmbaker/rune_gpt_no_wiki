Item: Apprentice
Summary: The apprentice of the Sorceress can be found sweeping at the house north-east of the Shantay Pass, and will tell people how to get into the Sorceress's Garden. She 'practises' her teleporting skills by teleporting players to the Sorceress's Garden. In order for her to teleport you into the garden, you first need to talk to Osman (Selim after completion of Beneath Cursed Sands) and ask if there's anything you can do to help him. Once she tells you about the garden, then she will teleport you ( 2•2•2•3•1)…
