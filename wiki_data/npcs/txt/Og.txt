Item: Og
Summary: Og is an ogre encountered during the Watchtower quest. His worst nemesis is Toban, and during the quest he sends you to get his gold that Toban took from him. Surprisingly, Og seems to be one of the few ogres that can speak the common language rather fluently. He can be located north-west of Yanille within debris remains along with other ogres. After the quest, he cannot be spoken to.
