Item: Savage bird
Summary: The savage bird was a scrapped random event added to the game cache in 2004. Presumably, it would have appeared at random intervals and attacked players, in a similar fashion to the swarm. It had an identical appearance to how terrorbirds looked at the time, except smaller and recoloured to be dark red.
