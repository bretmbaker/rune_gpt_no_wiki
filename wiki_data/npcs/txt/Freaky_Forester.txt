Item: Freaky Forester
Summary: The Freaky Forester is a random event in which players are teleported to a small clearing in a forest and asked to kill a pheasant with a certain number of tails. After successfully completing this random event by delivering any pheasant carcass to the Freaky Forester, players are rewarded with a piece of the Lederhosen set, or a lamp if they already own the set, and the player is taken back to the player's former location before the event (whenever possible). The event can be left at any time by using the portal, this however grants no rewards if the event is not completed.
