Item: Cap'n Hand
Summary: Cap'n Hand is a pirate who was involved in the "Lost Pirate" random event. He would mistake the player for one of his shipmates. If the player ignored him, he would attack the player with a crossbow. He would usually keep shooting the player to the death. He was very accurate and hit almost every time even if the player was wearing high level armour. If a player tried to talk to him while he was in the process of attacking that player, he would stop attacking them and they would receive a small reward from him.
