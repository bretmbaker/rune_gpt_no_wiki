Item: H.A.M. Deacon
Summary: The H.A.M. Deacon is a non-interactive NPC and a speaker in the Humans Against Monsters cult. He preaches to members of the group in their cave below Misthalin, spreading propaganda and hatred against monsters. The H.A.M. members in the audience before him will always agree with what he says. Like the leader of the group, Johanhus Ulsbrecht, he wears dark H.A.M. robes. He is apparently a senior member of the cult, as he and Sigmund toasted to the drill during the Death to the Dorgeshuun quest.
