Item: Kharrim
Summary: Kharrim was a Zamorakian messenger during the late Second Age, and seems to be, judging by his appearance, from Karamja. He is spoken to during the Curse of the Empty Lord, though he can only be seen by the player when they are wearing the Ring of visibility obtained during Desert Treasure I. They must speak to Kharrim in order to progress through the miniquest and find out more about Zamorak's betrayal of Zaros.
