Item: Chuck
Summary: Chuck was a certer in RuneScape Classic, who could provide certificates for logs. Most certers were not converted to RuneScape 2 as they were replaced by the bank note system. For some unknown reason, Chuck was included in the RuneScape 2 beta files. His house can still be found north of the bank in East Ardougne.
