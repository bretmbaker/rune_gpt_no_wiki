Item: Scout (2013 Goblin Invasion)
Summary: The Scout was a part of the third stage of the 2013 Goblin Invasion event and was stationed in the Varrock Castle courtyard. Players could follow the scout into a cave full of Goblin raiders. The scout was replaced by the Commander in the fourth stage the following week, and the goblin cave could instead be accessed through a portal.
