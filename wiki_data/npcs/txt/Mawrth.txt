Item: Mawrth
Summary: Mawrth is one of the many citizens of Lletya. When talked to, she complains that it's difficult to look after her mischievous children, Eoin and Iona. Both her children look to be around 10 years old, but Mawrth reveals that they are in their thirties, which she believes is too young not to be looked after. This shows the slow aging of elves compared to humans. The player reacts in surprise and asks how old Mawrth is. The elf replies that it is rude to ask a lady her age.
