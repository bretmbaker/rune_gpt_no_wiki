Item: Egg (2014 Easter event)
Summary: Eggs were laid by the easter egg bird, and then rolled down a chute towards a pile of easter eggs in the Easter Bunny's burrow during the 2014 Easter event. After they rolled into the pile, hypnotised rabbits picked up the eggs, took them to the surface, and then buried them in mounds of dirt. Players were also able to take eggs from the pile, and then deliver them to the children.
