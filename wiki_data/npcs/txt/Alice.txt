Item: Alice
Summary: Alice is a widow who runs the family farm west of Port Phasmatys. She runs the shop while her daughter Lyra watches over the nearby herb and allotment patches and her deceased husband, Malcolm, manages the undead livestock. Her daughter ensures they do not pay the blood tithes by luring young farmers back to their farm, using them to pay the tithe instead.[1]
