Item: Tramp (pillory)
Summary: Tramps are poor humans living on the street in various cities throughout RuneScape. They apparently own the Pelters' Veg Stalls, accessible through a crate located near the pillories in the cities they inhabit, where they sell rotten tomatoes for 1 coin each. They cannot be directly interacted with, but they will throw rotten tomatoes at any player locked up in the pillory nearby, while yelling at the player.
