Item: Guard (Jatizso)
Summary: Guards are found at the three gates leading to Jatizso and the northern isles of the Fremennik Isles, and one is found in King Sorvott's throne room. When in a pair at the gates, one is called "Rightie" and the other "Leftie". When spoken to, they will talk to each other leading to a confusing dialogue. The player will get frustrated and scream. The unattackable guards can also be found in the isles north of Jatizso, fighting the Ice troll males and females.
