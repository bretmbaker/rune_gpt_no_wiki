Item: Koschei the deathless
Summary: Koschei the deathless is a Fremennik warrior that players must fight during The Fremennik Trials quest, in order to complete Thorvald the Warrior's test of bravery and win his vote. The player must defeat Koschei three times without dying; although they are told they must defeat him to win, defeating him three times is considered enough to win, as the test is of bravery, not strength. Weapons and armour are not allowed within the arena, though the player can optionally bring a dramen branch and a knife to make a dramen staff once inside.
