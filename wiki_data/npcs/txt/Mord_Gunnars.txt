Item: Mord Gunnars
Summary: Mord Gunnars is the husband of Maria Gunnars. He is found on the north-most dock in Rellekka. The Fremennik Isles quest can be started by speaking to him. He is native to Jatizso, though his wife is native to Neitiznot. This doesn't seem to put any strain between him and his wife. He offers a free ferry for a player between Rellekka and Jatizso during and after the quest, The Fremennik Isles.
