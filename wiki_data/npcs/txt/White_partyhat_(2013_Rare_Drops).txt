Item: White partyhat (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The white partyhat was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a white partyhat. This was the first introduction of partyhats in Old School RuneScape, though they were later made available as part of the annual Christmas holiday events. The spawns were available for 10 days, and dropped at the same time as the red, yellow, blue, green, and purple partyhats.
