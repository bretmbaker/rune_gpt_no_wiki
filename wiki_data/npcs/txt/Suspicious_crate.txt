Item: Suspicious crate
Summary: A suspicious crate is involved in the 2022 Easter event. During the event, Ali Morrisane tasks the player with sending a special hot sauce for the person in the crate and getting a secret report from them back to Ali Morrisane. Afterwards, the player asks them for an ice cooler for the Easter Bunny's eggs, so that they won't melt while travelling through the desert.
