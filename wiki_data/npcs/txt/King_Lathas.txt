Item: King Lathas
Summary: King Lathas Ardignas is the king of East Ardougne, the capital of Kandarin. As the sons of King Ulthas, he and his younger brother Tyras are responsible for the division of the city between West and East.[1] Lathas rules the eastern part of the city, although the existence of the Ardougne City Council leaves the extent of his power uncertain. He and his brother are the great-grandsons of the first King of Kandarin, who founded the kingdom after the Great Battle, leading the Ardignas bloodline to rise to power.[2]
