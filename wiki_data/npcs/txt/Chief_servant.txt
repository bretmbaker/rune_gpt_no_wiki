Item: Chief servant
Summary: The Chief servant is the head of the Servants' Guild which is located north of the marketplace in East Ardougne. Despite the word servant in his title, he cannot be hired for use in your player-owned house. If talked to, he tells the player the general services that a servant can do for the player. He also mentions that more expensive servants do their work faster. He has five candidates to be your servant: Rick, the Maid, the Cook, the Butler and the Demon butler. Players may fire their current servant by talking to him.
