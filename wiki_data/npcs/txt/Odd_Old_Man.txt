Item: Odd Old Man
Summary: The Odd Old Man (real name Archibald Paldock) can be found at his house in northern Silvarea, slightly north-east of Varrock and west of Paterdomus Temple, tucked away in the mountain range. He collects bones, furs, teeth, and similar items for an unknown purpose. He claims to work for the Varrock Museum, bringing stuffed creatures to put on display, however, his phrasing suggests he is misleading the player, hiding the real reason why he wants these items. The bone sack on his back appears to frequently talk to him and tell him what to say, especially when pressed to answer difficult questions and to complete his stated objectives.
