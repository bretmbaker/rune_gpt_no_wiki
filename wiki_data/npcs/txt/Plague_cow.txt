Item: Plague cow
Summary: Plague cows are cows infected by a plague that recently beset the desert city of Sophanem. They are one of many plagues set upon the city by the former high priest Klenter, enraged by the actions of an adventurer stealing a canopic jar from his tomb while hypnotised by the Menaphite goddess Amascut.
