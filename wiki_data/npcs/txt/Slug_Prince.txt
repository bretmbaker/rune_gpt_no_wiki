Item: Slug Prince
Summary: The Slug Prince is encountered in the Witchaven Dungeon during The Slug Menace quest. He can only be fought once and requires 30 Slayer to kill. The people of Witchaven are obviously very mad at you for killing the Slug Prince, as after you kill him they tell you to leave them alone.
