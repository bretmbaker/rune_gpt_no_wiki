Item: Guardian mummy
Summary: The  guardian mummy runs the Pyramid Plunder minigame. Players can find him inside the Jalsavrah Pyramid in Sophanem, requiring partial completion of Icthlarin's Little Helper. The pyramid has four anonymous looking doors: one will lead the player into the room with the mummy, the other three only leading to identical rooms with no mummy inside. The correct door is completely random and changes over time. When picking the correct door, there is a possibility of being punched by the guardian mummy, giving the dialogue "A mysterious bandaged hand punches you away from the door. Ouch!".
