Item: Ueman, Teoki of Ralos
Summary: Ueman is one of seven[1] teoki in service of Ralos found under the Fortis Colosseum, and is responsible for maintaining it.[2] While Minimus handles much of the day-to-day function,[3] Ueman maintains the ultimate leadership role, because the Colosseum is considered a holy site honouring Ralos.[4]
