Item: Candle seller
Summary: The Candle seller in the Lumbridge Swamp near the dark hole entrance to the Lumbridge Swamp Caves sells candles for 1,000 coins each. They are so costly for the forgetful adventurer who wants to save time instead of getting better or cheaper light sources, any of which are required to explore the caves.
