Item: Logosia
Summary: Logosia is the chief librarian of the Arceuus Library. Found on the library's ground floor, she is regarded as an unhelpful librarian by visitors, as they claim that she refuses to help them. Players who speak to her will often be responded by a Shhhh!, and can engage in humorous dialogue.
