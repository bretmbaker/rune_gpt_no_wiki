Item: Boulder (Viyeldi caves)
Summary: Three boulders can be found in the Viyeldi caves during the Legends' Quest. One boulder must be pushed during the quest to access the sacred water. The first time one of the boulders is pushed, a spirit called Echned Zekin will appear and give the player a dark dagger and ask them to kill Viyeldi with it. The second time a boulder is pushed, Nezikchened will spawn and attack the player.
