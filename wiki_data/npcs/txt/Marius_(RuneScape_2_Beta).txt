Item: Marius (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: Marius was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He would have appeared in the original version of Death Plateau. Presumably he would have been the start point for the quest, asking the player to find a path up the plateau and gain access to the equipment storage room. Players would have been required to deliver the secret way map and the combination scroll to him in order to complete the quest.
