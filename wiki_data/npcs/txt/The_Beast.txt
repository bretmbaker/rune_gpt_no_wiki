Item: The Beast
Summary: The Beast is a cat, and a close companion of Smokin' Joe, a dwarf. The Beast lives in Keldagrim, where he ensures that those visiting the Laughing Miner Pub do not enter the Rat Pits unauthorised. If the player attempts to speak to The Beast, with or without a catspeak amulet, the cat will simply glower at them without responding.
