Item: Slave (Mourner Tunnels)
Summary: Slaves are citizens of West Ardougne whom the mourners took to their tunnels to dig towards the Temple of Light so that they could access the power of the Death Altar to speed up the Dark Lord's return, with the excuse that they had succumbed to the plague and therefore required to be quarantined. Four slaves can currently be found: two mining with pickaxes, one digging with a spade and a smaller one just walking around. Two mourners are guarding and taunting them. Because the mourners are unaware that the Temple's safeguard have been restored, the slaves continue digging despite their efforts being futile.
