Item: Pious Pete (20th Anniversary event)
Summary: Pious Pete was one of the occupants of the Realm of Memories during the 20th Anniversary event. He was a character in a former random event that was removed in 2006 before Old School RuneScape was released. When spoken to, Pious Pete laments how his candle lighting instructions used to confuse adventurers and eventually his chapel was closed down because of it.
