Item: Kephri
Summary: Kephri is a dawn scarab encountered at the end of the Path of Scabaras, within the Tombs of Amascut raid. Kephri, as the last of her kind, was tricked with an offer to be granted offspring and instead came under Amascut's servitude to be able to lure and capture Kephri's god Scabaras.
