Item: Araxyte (NPC)
Summary: Araxytes are a rare species of arachnid found exclusively in the Morytania Spider Cave. Though the smallest of these are unattackable and thus harmless to the player, their more matured variants are aggressive, can inflict venom, and require level 92 Slayer to be harmed.
