Item: Hooded Stranger
Summary: The Hooded Stranger originally appeared in the 2005 Christmas Event as Santa in disguise. Although the event was brought back in 2014, Santa had been graphically updated and the character was replaced by the Bearded stranger. As a result, he has never been present in Old School RuneScape.
