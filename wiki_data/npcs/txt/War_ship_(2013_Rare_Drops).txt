Item: War ship (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The war ship was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a war ship. This was the first introduction of the war ship in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of annual birthday holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the christmas cracker during the final week of 2013 rare drops.
