Item: Tegid
Summary: Tegid is a druid washing dirty laundry in the lake in Taverley. He plays a small role in Eadgar's Ruse and Mourning's End Part I quests. During the former quest, the player must ask him to hand over his dirty robes in order to make the fake man smell like a human. During the latter, the player must steal his soap with which to clean the bloody mourner top.
