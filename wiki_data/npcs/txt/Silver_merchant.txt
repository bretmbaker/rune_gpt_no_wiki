Item: Silver merchant
Summary: Erin, the Silver merchant, runs the Ardougne Silver Stall in East Ardougne. He plays a fairly large part in the Making History quest. The enchanted key is obtained from Erin during and after the quest; it is used in a miniquest to obtain the god Mjolnir weapons. He sells silver bars, silver ore, and unstrung symbols on his stall, buying unstrung symbols for more coins than usual shop owners.
