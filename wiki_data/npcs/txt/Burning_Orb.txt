Item: Burning Orb
Summary: Burning Orbs are objects that appear during the fight with Akkha in the Tombs of Amascut, where they appear if he unleashes his Trailing Orbs attack, and the player moves whilst in the north-west quadrant. If players walk into one, it will inflict a burn that periodically deals 5 damage for several hits, and can spread to unaffected players if next to them.
