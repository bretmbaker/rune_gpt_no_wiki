Item: Lux grub
Summary: Lux grubs are native inhabitants of the Chambers of Xeric. They are found in the same room as Vespula and are part of her encounter. As part of the fight, Vespula will periodically sting a grub, presumably injecting her eggs. They will then have a meter above their heads that slowly depletes, and must be fed Medivaemia blossoms in order to restore the meter. If their meter reaches zero, they will explode and release a Vespine soldier, which must be defeated, while also healing Vespula and the abyssal portal. Dealing with the grubs and the Vespine soldiers can be ignored if using the Redemption method, outlined in Vespula#Strategy. Otherwise, it is recommended to have at least one team member solely focusing on feeding the lux grubs found around the chamber to prevent the boss from healing itself.
