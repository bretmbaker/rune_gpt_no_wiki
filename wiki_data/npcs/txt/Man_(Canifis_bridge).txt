Item: Man (Canifis bridge)
Summary: A man could be found at the flooded bridge to the north-east of Canifis when the area was first released in June 2004. When spoken to, he told players that the bridge and the swamps to the east were flooded, preventing access to eastern Morytania. When the Haunted Woods were released in October, the swamp water receded, and the man was removed. Mazchna took his spot on the bridge when Slayer was released in January 2005.
