Item: Desert Spirit
Summary: The Desert Spirit is an unused NPC released with Enakhra's Lament. Its examine suggests it would have been encountered in the quest after defeating the first Boneguard who has a spirit trapped inside it. However, the Desert Spirit does not appear, and the player talks to a different character named Freed Spirit instead.
