Item: Seth
Summary: Seth was a certer in RuneScape Classic, who could provide certificates for Lobsters and Swordfish. Most certers were not converted to RuneScape 2 as they were replaced by the bank note system. However, Seth was included in the RuneScape 2 beta files, as he was classified as an NPC used in the Heroes' Quest. His stall can still be found in Brimhaven west of the Agility Arena entrance.
