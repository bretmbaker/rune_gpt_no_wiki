Item: Restless ghost
Summary: The restless ghost is the ghost main character of The Restless Ghost quest. Talking to him requires a ghostspeak amulet obtained from Father Urhney, who lives in a shack on the other side of the Lumbridge Swamp. He will say that a warlock stole his skull from the coffin. The ghost's skull is on an altar in the basement of the Wizards' Tower. Upon returning his skull to coffin, he will thank the player and disappear into the River Lum. Should the player see the ghost after that, he will not be interested in talking.
