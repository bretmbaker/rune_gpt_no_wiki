Item: Sherpa (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: The sherpa was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He would have appeared in the original version of Death Plateau. Presumably players would have been directed to speak to him by the hermit. After helping him, he would give the player the secret way map, which alongside the combination scroll would have been given to Marius to complete the quest.
