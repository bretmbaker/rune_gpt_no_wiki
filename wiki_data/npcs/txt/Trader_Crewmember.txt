Item: Trader Crewmember
Summary: Trader Crewmembers are employees of Trader Stan, who runs the charter ship system that operates all over Gielinor. At each port, there are two crewmembers, with the exception of Port Sarim and Corsair Cove, where Trader Stan himself is also present. Players may charter passage between ports for large sums of coins ranging from 200 to 3,200, destinations include Brimhaven, Karamja, Land's End, Port Khazard, Port Phasmatys, Port Piscarilius, Port Sarim, Corsair Cove, and the Shipyard. Crewmembers also run Trader Stan's Trading Post, an exotic store containing a variety of items, including the otherwise-unobtainable Tyras helm.
