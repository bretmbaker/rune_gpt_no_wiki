Item: Vampyric hound
Summary: The Vampyric hound is an unused NPC added with the expansion of Morytania. Presumably, it was intended to be found in the Haunted Woods, where it would have served as the companion of the Feral Vampyre Count. For unknown reasons, both characters were ultimately not released.
