Item: Fritz the Glassblower
Summary: Fritz the Glassblower teaches people how to make glass on Entrana. He will also buy molten glass from players for 20 coins per piece (25 coins if players are wearing the ring of charos (a)). It is not advisable to sell glass to him as on the Grand Exchange it can sell for around 73 coins each, which is much more than he will pay.
