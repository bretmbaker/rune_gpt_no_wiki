Item: Klenter
Summary: Klenter is a ghost and the former High Priest of Icthlarin. He died recently and was buried by means of an embalming ritual. Few mourned his loss or liked the man. The local embalmer describes him as a cruel and hard man, as well as grudgy and vindictive. Neite, who permitted him to feed her, also called him cranky and prone to making people suffer if he did not get his will.
