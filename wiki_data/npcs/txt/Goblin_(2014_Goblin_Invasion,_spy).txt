Item: Goblin (2014 Goblin Invasion, spy)
Summary: Goblins were involved in the first stage of the 2014 Goblin Invasion. During this stage, large numbers of goblins and guards could be found in and around Falador, with options to identify and capture. Players could side with either the guard or goblin factions by talking to the Guard Recruiter or Goblin Recruiter, then click to identify and capture the spies of the opposing side. Capturing a spy would increase the score of that player's faction by 1. This variant of goblin was removed with the release of the second stage of the goblin invasion event and replaced with the paintable goblin variant.
