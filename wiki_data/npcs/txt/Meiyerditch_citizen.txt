Item: Meiyerditch citizen
Summary: Meiyerditch citizen is a general term applied to many non-player character residents of Meiyerditch. They are seen throughout the entire city. Meiyerditch citizens are forced to give blood tithes or do menial work for the vampyres who dominate the Sanguinesti region of south-eastern Morytania.
The terrible living conditions and regular tithing make the Maiyerditch citizens very pale, thin and weak, many citizens have visible bite marks on their necks and blood running from their nose.
