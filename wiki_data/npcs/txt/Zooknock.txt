Item: Zooknock
Summary: Zooknock is the 10th squad mage who is involved in two quests. He can be found on Ape Atoll at the end of the Ape Atoll Dungeon. He makes enchanted bars with a m'amulet mould and monkey denture. He also makes monkey greegrees with a monkey talisman and the remains of a monkey (bones or corpse). You must first talk to him and ask "Can you make me another monkey talisman?" Then right-click the remains and use them on him and do the same with a talisman, he will not take items from the player's inventory. He will only accept items for one greegree each time he is asked; you must ask him again for each additional greegree you wish to make.
