Item: Sil'as Dahcsnu
Summary: Sil'as Dahcsnu is a monk of the Dagon'hai order. He can be found in the Tunnel of Chaos as part of What Lies Below. If spoken to, he will cast a spell that causes your character to dance and shout, "Argh! I can't stop dancing/headbanging/jumping!" However, if you have level 80 Magic or higher it will backfire onto him making him dance instead.
