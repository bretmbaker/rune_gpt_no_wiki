Item: Sir Prysin
Summary: Sir Ehntor Prysin [1] is one of King Roald's knights. He is located in the west part of Varrock Palace, on the ground floor[UK]1st floor[US]. He is the great-grandson of Wally who defeated Delrith 150 years ago, and, as such, is the custodian of Silverlight. To reduce the risk of Silverlight falling into the wrong hands, Sir Prysin placed the sword in a protective box that requires three keys to open. He then gave one key to wizard Traiborn, another to Captain Rovin, and kept the third key for himself.
