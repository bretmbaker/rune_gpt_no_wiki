Item: Disk of Returning (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The disk of returning was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a disk of returning. This was the first introduction of the disk of returning in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the midsummer holiday events and in Diango's Toy Store. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the chicken suit.
