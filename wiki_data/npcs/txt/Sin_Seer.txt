Item: Sin Seer
Summary: Sin Seer is one of the only known female seers. She can be found on the second floor of the building with the spinning wheel in Seers' Village. She is consulted during The General's Shadow miniquest. She is slightly crazy and (if not doing the mini-quest) will say "Augh! Your sins! They BLIND me!"
