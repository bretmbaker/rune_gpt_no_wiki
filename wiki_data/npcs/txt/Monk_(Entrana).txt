Item: Monk (Entrana)
Summary: The monk is an NPC who will expel anyone carrying weapons or armour from Entrana. If a player somehow manages to acquire any prohibited items while on the island, he will appear and say Hey, get that stuff off our island!. The player is then knocked unconscious and wakes up back at Port Sarim, exclaiming Urrrrrgh!
