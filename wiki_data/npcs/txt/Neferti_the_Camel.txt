Item: Neferti the Camel
Summary: Neferti the Camel is a camel found in a small paddock in Sophanem. Neferti can be spoken to using a Camulet, although the player does not need to be standing next to her, as there is no way into the pasture. When spoken to, Neferti asks the player to take her travelling with them, as her master is suffering from the plague, and is unable to leave Sophanem. The player declines as Neferti is too big to fit in the player's backpack.
