Item: Terror dog statue
Summary: Two Terror dog statues are found next to Tarn in the penultimate room of Tarn's Lair during the Lair of Tarn Razorlor miniquest. At the start of the battle with Tarn, he casts a spell on them to shatter them, revealing actual terror dogs. They then attack the player alongside Tarn's mutant form, although only Tarn must be defeated to progress.
