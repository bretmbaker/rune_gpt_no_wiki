Item: Golden sheep (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: Golden sheep were unused non-player characters present in the RuneScape 2 beta. They would have appeared in the original version of The Fremennik Trials, then known as "A Viking Quest". Presumably, they would have been found alongside Lalli and involved in one of the trials.
