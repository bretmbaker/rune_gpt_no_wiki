Item: Thorvald (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: Thorvald was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He would have appeared in the original version of The Fremennik Trials, then known as "A Viking Quest". Presumably, he would have assigned one of the trials needed to gain admission to the council.
