Item: Old man
Summary: The Old man is a pale old man who can be found on the deck of the wrecked ship north-west of Port Phasmatys. He is the Old Crone's lost son, and the player finds him for her during the quest Ghosts Ahoy. You need to return his ship to him to receive a Chest key. He is slightly insane as when you ask him why he's on this shipwreck, he will claim that his captain, a skeleton in a chair, is just waiting for the "winds to change".
