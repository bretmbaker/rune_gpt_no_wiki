Item: Mysterious Figure
Summary: The Mysterious Figure is an assassin hired by Enakhra[1] encountered during the quest Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire. After the player has obtained and placed one medallion, she will sometimes appear and attack players when they have one or more medallions in their inventory, similar to the stranger from Desert Treasure I, except if the player is in a Free-to-Play world. However, she is far more aggressive and lethal than the stranger, as she is capable of using protection prayers, attacks with all 3 combat styles, can Tele Block and freeze the player, and will return to ambush the player even if they defeat her. She can even follow the player into their own house, and can disguise herself as the sandwich lady random event. She can also appear when the player attempts to use a fairy ring. If the Mysterious Figure spawns in your house, they will stay stuck in your house until you deliver the medallion to the Ancient Vault and may not attack you on your way to the vault. Logging out while the medallion is in your inventory will NOT despawn the Mysterious Figure.
