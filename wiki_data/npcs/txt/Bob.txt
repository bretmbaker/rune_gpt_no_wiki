Item: Bob
Summary: Bob is the owner of Bob's Brilliant Axes in southern Lumbridge. Players can pay Bob to repair damaged Barrows equipment and Moon equipment. However, many players prefer to repair their Barrows armour at an armour stand in a player-owned house because it is usually cheaper depending on the player's Smithing level.
