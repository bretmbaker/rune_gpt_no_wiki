Item: Large Tendril
Summary: Large tendrils are part of The Strangler which appear during the fight with Vardorvis during and after Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire. Throughout the fight, they appear from the ground around the edges of the arena, and throw an axe before disappearing. As Vardovis's health is depleted, more and more tendrils will spawn at once.
