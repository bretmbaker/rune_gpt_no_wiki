Item: Recruiter
Summary: The Recruiter is found in the city square of West Ardougne. He tries to recruit the citizens of West Ardougne into King Tyras's army. Due to Tyras being unpopular and hated among the people of West Ardougne, his job has been a really tough one as he is pelted with tomatoes whenever he mentions Tyras. Apparently, the Recruiter is not aware of the death of King Tyras, which occurs during Regicide.
