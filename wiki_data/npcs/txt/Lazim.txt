Item: Lazim
Summary: Lazim is a mysterious character in the southern Kharidian Desert near the Quarry, and starts the quest Enakhra's Lament here, whilst posing as a desert sculptor. Though he is openly a mage and follower of the god Zamorak, his true intentions are not revealed until the end of the quest. He is particularly impatient and sarcastic, often making snide remarks at the expense of player's intelligence.
