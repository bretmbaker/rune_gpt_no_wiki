Item: Kuradal
Summary: Kuradal is a Slayer master and daughter of Duradel, whom she replaces after While Guthix Sleeps. Like her father, Kuradal requires a combat level of 100 and a Slayer level of 50 in order to receive Slayer tasks from her. Players may also present the Slayer cape to Kuradal if they do not meet the combat level requirement for her.
