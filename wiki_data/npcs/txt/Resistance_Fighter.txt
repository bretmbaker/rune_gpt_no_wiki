Item: Resistance Fighter
Summary: Resistance fighters are people of West Ardougne that appear during the revolution in West and East Ardougne during Song of the Elves.
The resistance fighters fight alongside the player, Elena, Jethick, Kilron and Omart against the mourners, knights of Ardougne and paladins as part of the liberation of Ardougne from the Iorwerth Clan and King Lathas. They are poorly equipped and not particularly trained in combat and can, unlike the named NPCs, die in battle. The resistance fighters can however be a useful asset if the player can distract the enemies.
