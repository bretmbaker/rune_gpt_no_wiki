Item: Dwarven Ferryman
Summary: Two Dwarven Ferrymen can be found in the Keldagrim south-west mine outside of Keldagrim. One is located in the same area as the Dwarven Boatman. The ferrymen are both near the entrance to the mines. They will take players across the River Kelda to the deeper section of the mines for a fee of 2 coins. Their ferry is two-way (with one of the dwarves operating the ferry from each side of the river), so it would be a total of 4 coins for a roundtrip. The trips are free, however, if the player has a ring of charos (a) equipped. The trip from the mine to the mainland is also free, should the player not have 2 coins on them.
