Item: Postie Pete
Summary: Postie Pete is a sentient skull and postman. He delivers all of the 'Postbag from the Hedge' letters to their destinations and ventures into whatever dangerous places he must to get there - although he can never be seen to do this in-game, preferring instead to pop up around Castle Wars, the Falador Party Room, Varrock Palace library, Ice Mountain, the Laughing Miner Pub the Bandit Camp general store in the Wilderness, and the Ardougne Zoo.
