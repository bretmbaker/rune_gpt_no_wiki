Item: Delrith
Summary: Delrith is a demon of unknown origin resembling a Lesser demon in appearance. He is summoned by dark wizards from a stone table during the Demon Slayer quest. Delrith was once summoned in ancient times by a cult of monks. Immediately after being summoned he was confronted by Wally, an ancient knight of sorts, and quickly defeated with the powerful weapon known as Silverlight and an incantation. For unknown reasons the cult of Zamorakian Dark wizards at the south entrance of Varrock are performing the ritual to summon Delrith into this world again.
