Item: Kaleb Paramaya
Summary: Kaleb Paramaya runs the Paramaya Inn on the 1st floor[UK]2nd floor[US] of the north-east building in Shilo Village. He sells Paramaya tickets for 35 coins or a pack of 5 for 175 coins. These grant access to the dormitory to sleep, however, as players do not need to sleep, this is a purely aesthetic feature.
