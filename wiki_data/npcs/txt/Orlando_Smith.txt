Item: Orlando Smith
Summary: Orlando Smith is a natural historian found on the basement floor of the Varrock Museum. He runs the Natural history quiz there, in which he asks players to go around and look at the plaques on all of the museum exhibits, testing their knowledge of the creatures of Gielinor. He will reward players who finish the quiz with museum kudos and 1,000 Slayer and Hunter experience. Once a player has 153 kudos, they may speak to him to complete a step in the Hard Varrock Diary.
