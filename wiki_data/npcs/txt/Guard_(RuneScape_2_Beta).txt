Item: Guard (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: The Guard was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He would have appeared in the original version of Death Plateau. Presumably, players would have been sent to him by the head servant to find the combination scroll to the storeroom. Most likely, players would have played dice against him in order to obtain the scroll.
