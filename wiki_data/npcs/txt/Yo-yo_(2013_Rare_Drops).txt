Item: Yo-yo (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The yo-yo was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a yo-yo. This was the first introduction of the yo-yo in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Christmas holiday events. The spawns were available for one week.
