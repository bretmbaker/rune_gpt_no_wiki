Item: Coenus
Summary: Coenus is a Menaphite guard and chief gatekeeper of Menaphos. He appears briefly during the Contact! quest, during a cutscene. Since Sophanem was quarantined as a result of several plagues Coenus has monitored the bridge that connects the cities, ensuring that the disease does not spread. His brutal methods have drawn some criticism, and he is a contemptible and hated man in Sophanem.
