Item: Moonlight antelope
Summary: The moonlight antelope is a creature that players can capture with the Hunter skill at level 91 by using a pitfall trap. They can be found underground in the Hunter Guild, south past the moonlight moths. Unlike other creatures hunted via pitfall traps (such as horned graahks), players will always succeed in hunting moonlight antelopes.
