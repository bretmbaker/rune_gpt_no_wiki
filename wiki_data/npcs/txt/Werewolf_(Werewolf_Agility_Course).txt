Item: Werewolf (Werewolf Agility Course)
Summary: This werewolf guards the entrance to the Werewolf Agility Courses, located in the Haunted Woods. He will not let a player in unless they're wearing a ring of charos. Attempting to speak to him as with a low combat level may be tedious, as the ruins where he is located in often contain leeches.
