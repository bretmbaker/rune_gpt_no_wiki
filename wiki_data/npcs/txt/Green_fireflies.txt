Item: Green fireflies
Summary: Green fireflies are found in the Scrubfoot's cave beneath Goblin Village, at the bottom of the long slide. They were originally added as part of the 2020 Christmas event, during which certain green fireflies could be caught to obtain a set of green fireflies as an item.
