Item: Guard (Below Ice Mountain)
Summary: Guards loiter around the courtyard of the Varrock Palace as the adventurer runs past them at the very end of a barbarian workout coached by Atlas, which must be completed in order to impress Checkal during the events of Below Ice Mountain. Unlike their common counterpart, these guards cannot be fought or stolen from.
