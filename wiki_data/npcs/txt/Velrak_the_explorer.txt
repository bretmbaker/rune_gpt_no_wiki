Item: Velrak the explorer
Summary: Velrak the explorer plays a small role in the Heroes' Quest and Scorpion Catcher quests as he is the one who gives the player a dusty key (assuming that players are not fishing for lava eels in the Lava Maze during Heroes' Quest and do not have access to the Legends' Guild to buy a dusty key during Scorpion Catcher). He can be found in the Black Knights' Base in Taverley Dungeon in a prison cell.
