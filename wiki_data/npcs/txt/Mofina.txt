Item: Mofina
Summary: Mofina is a priest found on the top floor of the Arceuus church. Players who speak to her will learn that the Arceuus church is used for meditation for the mysteries of the Dark Altar, rather than a church used for worshipping gods. However, players may pray at the altar to restore their prayer points.
