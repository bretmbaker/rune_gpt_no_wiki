Item: Meiyerditch miner
Summary: Meiyerditch miners extract daeyalt ore for the vampyres. It appears that they have been doing this for their whole life. They wield unique, one-headed pickaxes. If you have no pickaxe when entering the mine, a bronze pickaxe can be obtained by speaking to one of the miners.
