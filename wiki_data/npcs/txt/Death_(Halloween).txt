Item: Death (Halloween)
Summary: Death is a non-player character who appears at a player's death during Halloween events. When he appears, he proclaims a random phrase (a list of which can be seen below). According to Mod Ash, Death is an aspect of the Grim Reaper, and is merely a visual representation of the "inconceivable reality".[1]
