Item: Iago
Summary: Iago was an unreleased member of the Group of Advanced Gardeners who was added to the game with the release of Farming. Most likely, he was originally intended to watch over the Cactus patch in Al Kharid, but the ability to protect cacti was removed before launch. When this feature returned in an update in 2014, Ayesha was added to supervise the patch instead, and Iago was removed from the game files. As a result, he has never been present in Old School RuneScape.
