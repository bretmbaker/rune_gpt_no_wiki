Item: Wizard Distentor
Summary: Wizard Distentor is one of the non-player characters who teleports you to the rune essence mine. He is the leader of the Wizards' Guild in Yanille. He is also considered by most to be the best NPC for rune essence, as he is positioned closest to a bank; however, players need to have a Magic level of 66 to access this.
