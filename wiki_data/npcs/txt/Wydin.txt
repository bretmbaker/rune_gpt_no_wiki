Item: Wydin
Summary: Wydin is the owner of Food Store in Port Sarim. He sells a variety of fresh food. Wydin also plays a small part in the Pirate's Treasure quest; players must retrieve smuggled rum from a crate in his storeroom. To enter the storeroom players must be both an employee of Wydin's store, and wearing a white apron. There is an apron located in the storeroom, but it cannot be telegrabbed as there is a solid wall in the way. However, there is also an apron hanging in the nearby Gerrant's Fishy Business directly north.
