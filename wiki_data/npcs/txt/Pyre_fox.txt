Item: Pyre fox
Summary: The pyre fox is a creature found in the Avium Savannah, south-east of the Hunters' Guild, that players can capture with the Hunter skill at level 57 by using a deadfall trap. Setting up a deadfall trap requires a knife and logs, and optionally baiting it with a jerboa tail. It is recommended to bring an axe as there are trees nearby.
