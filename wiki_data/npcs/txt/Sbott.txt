Item: Sbott
Summary: Sbott is the werewolf tanner on the northern side of Canifis. His shop is marked with the tanning icon (). His tannery is more expensive than average, charging a bit more than double what most other tanners charge to tan a hide. However his shop is very close to the CKS fairy ring in Canifis as well as a bank, so some players find the convenience to be worth the few coins extra cost.
