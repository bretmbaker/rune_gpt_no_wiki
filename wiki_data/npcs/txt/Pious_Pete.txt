Item: Pious Pete
Summary: Pious Pete was a Saradominist monk who was featured in the Candlelight random event. The event, which consisted of relighting candles in Pete's church, was notoriously difficult due to the vague instructions given, and the fact that candles would frequently extinguish before all could be lit. It could take some players hours or even days to complete, yet would only give a few hundred coins as a reward, making it deeply unpopular. While there were many reports of players getting the event from February until June 2006, it appears to have been quietly removed after this date, with the last confirmed occurrence on 2 June.
