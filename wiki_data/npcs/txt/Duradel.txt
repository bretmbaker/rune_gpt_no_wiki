Item: Duradel
Summary: Duradel is the highest level Slayer master. He's located in Shilo Village, which requires the completion of the Shilo Village quest to be accessed. He can be reached by climbing the ladder in the fishing shop located just south of the river. To receive Slayer tasks from Duradel, a combat level of 100 and a Slayer level of 50 is required, or any combat level if the player has achieved 99 Slayer and shows him the Slayer cape. Being assigned a Slayer task from him is a hard task in the Karamja Diary. Duradel appears to be wielding rune claws.
