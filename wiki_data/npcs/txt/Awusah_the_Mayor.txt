Item: Awusah the Mayor
Summary: Awusah the Mayor is the leader of Nardah, a small settlement in the south-eastern Kharidian Desert. Prior to the completion of Spirits of the Elid, Nardah is beset by a curse that caused the town's water supply to dry up, making his job considerably more difficult. Although he has been mayor for a while, he has not yet learnt how to properly deal with the bureaucracy in the capital Menaphos, but this has not affected his popularity.[1] He has three armed guards, Poltenip, Radat, and Tarik, outside his room in the town hall.
