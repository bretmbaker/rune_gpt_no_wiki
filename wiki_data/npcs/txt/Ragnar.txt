Item: Ragnar
Summary: Ragnar is a member of the Mountain Tribe, a Fremennik group who reside in a Mountain Camp. He was betrothed to Asleif Hamalsdotter, the daughter of the camp's chief, Hamal.[1] In Year 155 of the Fifth Age, the couple were supposed to meet up by the pool near the camp, where he intended to give her a necklace.[2] However, she arrived before him and was killed by the Kendal, a man impersonating a local deity.[3][4] Unwilling to leave without her, the camp remained in the same spot, with Hamal and eventually Ragnar both denying that she was dead.[5][6] Asleif's spirit would sing, drawing Ragnar to the pool.[7]
