Item: Chicken suit (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The chicken suit was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a chicken suit. This was the second introduction of the chicken suit in Old School RuneScape following the 2013 Easter event, though it was later made available as part of the annual easter holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the disk of returning.
