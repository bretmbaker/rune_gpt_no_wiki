Item: Red geist
Summary: Red geists were found in the 2013 Halloween event by shooting toy boatmen with a ghost buster 500 loaded with a white destabiliser. The red geist could then be busted with a red destabiliser. After busting 3 of one type of geist you could collect one piece of the skeleton outfit from Diango.
