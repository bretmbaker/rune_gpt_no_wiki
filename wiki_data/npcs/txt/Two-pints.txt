Item: Two-pints
Summary: Two-pints is located in the Flying Horse Inn at East Ardougne. She is known for being the taskmaster for the Ardougne Diaries. Her name is most likely a reference to the fact that she had one too many pints, as her drunken gait suggests. She supplies the player with free Ardougne cloaks once they complete the corresponding achievement diary.
