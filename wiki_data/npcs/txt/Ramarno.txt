Item: Ramarno
Summary: Ramarno is an Imcando dwarf found in the Ruins of Camdozaal, accessible after completion of the quest Below Ice Mountain. Ramarno believes that he is the last remaining Imcando dwarf. He requests the player's assistance in gathering Barronite for the Sacred Forge as he supposedly is blind. Players can collect Barronite shards throughout Camdozaal which can be given to Ramarno in exchange for buffs. All five of the permanent buffs can be activated at the same time.
