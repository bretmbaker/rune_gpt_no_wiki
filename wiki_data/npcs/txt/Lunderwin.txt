Item: Lunderwin
Summary: Lunderwin is a fairy found near Irksol, who buys cabbages from the player for 100 coins each. The cabbages cannot be noted. This is not a recommended way for players to make money as it will come at a low profit due to the entrance fee of one diamond to enter the marketplace.
