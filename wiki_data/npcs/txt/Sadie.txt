Summary: Sadie is a shepherd dog who was adopted by Sarah during the 2024 Christmas event. Following an update, she remains adopted regardless of whether or not the player has completed the event. When petted, a game message will state, You pet the dog... The resulting frantic tail-wagging disturbs a crop of dust bunnies.
