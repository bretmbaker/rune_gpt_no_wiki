Item: Monkey (Trouble Brewing)
Summary: A monkey is used in Trouble Brewing to gather bitternuts. They are found in the island in between the two bases, and they can be caught awarding the player with 15 Agility and Hunter experience. A bowl of red water or a bowl of blue water must be used on the monkey, making it a red monkey or a blue monkey. The dyed monkey can then be used on a Bitternut Tree, and it will throw down a bitternut to the player. If a monkey from the opposing team is in the tree as well, the two monkeys will fight, only one will throw down a bitternut, and the other will disappear.
