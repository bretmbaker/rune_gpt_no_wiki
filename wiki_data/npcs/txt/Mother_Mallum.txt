Item: Mother Mallum
Summary: Mother Mallum - Mahey'ish Medron in the ancient, all but forgotten, Saradominist language - is the queen of the Sea Slugs and resembles an enormous mollusk, and she plans to take over Gielinor. She currently has control of the Fishing Platform and Witchaven. She first reveals herself to the world during The Slug Menace quest when the player is unknowingly tricked into releasing her. She attempted to conquer Gielinor over 4000 years ago but was stopped by the Temple Knights. She communicates using a human body as a host, and during the last part of the Slug Menace quest, she tries to obtain the player character as a new host. The player is ultimately saved from her by being teleported out of the cave by Savant.
