Item: Gita Prymes
Summary: Gita Prymes is one of the Spirit Anglers found at their base at the Ruins of Unkah, east of the docks. She is right next to the rope and harpoon spawns. She designed the spirit angler's outfit and will offer to change any piece of the Angler's outfit into the corresponding Spirit Angler equivalent for the price of 1,200 spirit flakes per piece, thus requiring 4,800 for the whole outfit.
