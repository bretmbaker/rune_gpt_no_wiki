Item: Mayor Hobb
Summary: Mayor Eustace Hobb is the current mayor of Witchaven. He can be found in his house before the completion of The Slug Menace quest. As the antagonist, he is heavily involved with Slug Menace, and after the quest, he disappears. During the quest, you find out he is in league with Mother Mallum, and he actually has gills (as he is possessed by a Sea slug). He helped release Mother Mallum by trying to open up a Saradomin shrine, but this was a cover up of what he really plans to do. His location after the quest is unknown.
