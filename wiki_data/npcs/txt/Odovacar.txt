Item: Odovacar
Summary: Odovacar is the poor banker in Tarn's Lair. He allows players to access their banks or check their Grand Exchange offers, for a fee of 100 coins per use of his services. Players are advised to bring a good amount of coins (at least a couple thousand) in case they plan on making frequent use of his services, such as banking drops from the monsters in the dungeon. Unlike other bankers, Odovacar does not un-note items for players.
