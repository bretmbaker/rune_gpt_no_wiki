Item: Cornelius
Summary: Cornelius is the banker of Burgh de Rott. During In Aid of the Myreque, he explains to the player what needs repairing in the bank to make it usable as such. After fixing the bank booth and patching up the wall, he mentions that the player needs to find someone to operate it, to which the player answers by offering him the job, and he gladly accepts after "getting dressed appropriately for the job", when he just puts on a hat with poker cards fit in it. After this, the bank in Burgh de Rott remains unlocked for the rest of the game.
