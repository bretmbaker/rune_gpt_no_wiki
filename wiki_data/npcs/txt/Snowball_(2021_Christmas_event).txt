Item: Snowball (2021 Christmas event)
Summary: Snowballs were found during the 2021 Christmas event when building snowmen for Buoy and Gurl. A tiny snowball was placed on the ground when choosing the roll-snowball option on snow. Each time the snowball was rolled, it would move one tile forward and increase in size by 1 increment. Once the snowball had become a little snowball or larger, it could be picked up to obtain the item of corresponding size: little, small, normal, big, large, huge, or humongous, along with the message You pick up the snowball. The snowballs could then be placed on the scuffed snow piles to create a snowman.
