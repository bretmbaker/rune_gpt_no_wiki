Item: Tiadeche
Summary: Tiadeche is the youngest son of the chief of Tai Bwo Wannai, Timfraku, and one of the three brothers in Tai Bwo Wannai. He is an aspiring fisherman, but unsuccessful; according to his father, it is because he does not listen to advice about how to improve his technique. During Tai Bwo Wannai Trio, he can be found fishing Karambwan on the coast of Karamja, north of the crashed gnome glider by the shipyard (not functional gnome glider or on the same section of the island as the volcano). When the Tai Bwo Wannai Trio quest is complete, he can be found in the village of Tai Bwo Wannai in the most south-western house where he runs his shop.
