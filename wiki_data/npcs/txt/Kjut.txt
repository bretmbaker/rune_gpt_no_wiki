Item: Kjut
Summary: Kjut runs Kjut's Kebabs in Keldagrim. He will not let players use his sink and fireplace and will complain if a player uses any item on either. He also converses with players about the location of the Drunken Dwarf Random Event informing them that he just recently stopped by to purchase Kebabs and probably won't be back for a long time.
