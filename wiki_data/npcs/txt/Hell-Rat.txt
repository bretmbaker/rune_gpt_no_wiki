Item: Hell-Rat
Summary: Hell-rats are found in Evil Dave's basement in Edgeville and can only be accessed after starting the Evil Dave subquest in Recipe for Disaster. Hell-rats are caught by having your cat chase and catch them, just like normal rats. After a cat or kitten manages to kill a couple of Hell-rats, it will become a hellcat or hell-kitten. The cat may be changed back to normal by feeding it milk or by talking to Dave's mother.
