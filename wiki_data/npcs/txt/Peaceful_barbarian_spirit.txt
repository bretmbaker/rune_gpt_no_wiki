Item: Peaceful barbarian spirit
Summary: Peaceful barbarian spirits appear when chewed bones are cremated atop Baxtorian Falls during and after the Barbarian Training miniquest. After the remains are cremated on a pyre ship, they fly off into the sky and reward the player who freed them. If mangled bones are used, a Ferocious barbarian spirit will appear instead.
