Item: Noterazzo
Summary: Noterazzo is the owner of the Bandit Duty Free, he is located in the Wilderness Bandit Camp. He purportedly gives players the best deals they will find. When asked why, he says it is due to the heavy taxes on general stores in Asgarnia and Misthalin and because of that it is hard for them to run an effective business, while he claims that the taxmen do not visit him. This is reflected in his buying prices, which at empty stock are the same as High Level Alchemy value, a trait shared with Martin Thwait's Lost and Found.
