Item: Rokuh
Summary: Rokuh runs Rok's Chocs Box merchant stall. He can be found in the town square of Nardah, located just south-east of the fountain. He is generally well liked by his fellow citizens, as he sells choc-ice at an affordable price while a curse affected the town's water supply. He says he purchased a box of magical non-melting ice (possibly an ice cooler) from a visitor, which provides the ice for the choc-ices.
