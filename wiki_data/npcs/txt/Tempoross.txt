Item: Tempoross
Summary: Tempoross is a minigame-style boss that is fought using skills rather than combat. Also known as the Spirit of the Sea, it is an ancient entity believed to be as old as Gielinor itself. It is able to create intense storms that make sailing difficult, and has recently awoken after having laid dormant for centuries, wreaking havoc upon sailors who were unfortunate enough to cross its path in the seas.
