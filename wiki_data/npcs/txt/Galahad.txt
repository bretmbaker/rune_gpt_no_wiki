Item: Galahad
Summary: Brother Galahad[1] was formerly a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He now lives in a house west of McGrubor's Wood and does not mind somebody stopping by to talk to once and a while, stating that it is rare that this happens. During the conversation he may give players a cup of tea.
