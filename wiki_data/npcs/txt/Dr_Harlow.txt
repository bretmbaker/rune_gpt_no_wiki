Item: Dr Harlow
Summary: Dr Randulf Harlow [1] is a retired vampyre slayer in the Blue Moon Inn in Varrock. If a player has started Vampyre Slayer, they must buy him a beer in order to convince him to teach them how to kill Count Draynor. Dr Harlow will then give players a stake. After completing the quest, Dr Harlow will go back to what he was saying before ("Buy me a beer pleash").
