Item: Gnome traveller
Summary: The gnome travellers (also known as gnome companions) are two gnomes on the 1st floor[UK]2nd floor[US] of the King's Axe Inn claiming to be from the Grand Tree, although one of them claims to be from the Tree Gnome Village before being corrected by the other. They disappear after The Giant Dwarf is completed. They appear to be led by the gnome emissary, Laneel.
