Item: Captain Siad
Summary: Captain Siad is the man who controls the Desert Mining Camp, a harsh camp deep in the Kharidian Desert that forces slaves to work. Players must investigate Siad's room during The Tourist Trap, though he watches the player and distrusts them. However, once the player searches his bookcases and finds that he has an interest in sailing, they can distract him while he talks about his days at sea and find the Wrought iron key and the Cell door key. Sure enough, if a player searches the bookcase in his office, they will find the Sailing book.
