Item: Nulodion
Summary: Nulodion is the official Dwarf Cannon engineer and Weapons Development Chief of the Dwarven Black Guard. During the Dwarf Cannon quest, he gives the player an ammo mould and Nulodion's notes to bring back to Captain Lawgof. Nulodion's Multicannon parts for sale is the only place in all of RuneScape that sells the parts of the dwarf multicannon (once the player has completed the Dwarf Cannon quest). The store also sells the cannon instruction manual, and ammo moulds to make your own cannonballs. Ammo moulds are used in the Between a Rock... quest.
