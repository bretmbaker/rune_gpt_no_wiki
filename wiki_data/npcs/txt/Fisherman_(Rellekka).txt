Item: Fisherman (Rellekka)
Summary: A Fisherman is a Fremennik found fishing on the docks of Rellekka, the capital of the Fremennik Province. As a member of the council, he can be asked for his vote during The Fremennik Trials, but he refuses to give it to the player. During Sigmund's trial, he asks the player for a map from Swensen the Navigator in exchange for a rare fish. If the player has completed the quest, the Fisherman will greet them warmly if spoken to.
