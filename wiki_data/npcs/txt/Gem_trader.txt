Item: Gem trader
Summary: The gem trader runs the Gem Trader stall in Al Kharid. He buys and sells sapphires, emeralds, rubies, and diamonds and their uncut versions as well. His shop isn't frequently used by most players due to the predominance of the Grand Exchange, where sellers can receive more money for the gems, cut or uncut. However, it is popular with ironmen. In the Family Crest quest, he directs the player to Avan at the Al Kharid mine.
