Item: Malak
Summary: Malak is a vampyre noble who can be found in the Hair of the Dog Inn in Canifis. He is fairly haughty and cunning and has a very low opinion of the village's inhabitants, whom he calls 'filthy wolfen folk' and plainly 'idiots', whilst Canifis itself he describes as a 'pathetic excuse for a village' and a 'wolfen cesspit.'
