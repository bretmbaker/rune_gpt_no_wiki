Item: Perdu
Summary: Perdu is a travelling dwarven merchant who runs the Lost Property shop. He will return certain reward items to you if he thinks you have lost them, although his prices are higher than what you would pay elsewhere. The items on Perdu's list are things that you normally could get back for free, or for a smaller payment of coins.
