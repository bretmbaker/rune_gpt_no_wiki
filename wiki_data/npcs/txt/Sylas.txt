Item: Sylas
Summary: Sylas is a rather peculiar item collector found in Taverley. He is just south of the house portal in Taverley. He starts the members' quest Grim Tales. Sylas often repeats what he says in a way that he is reassuring or talking to himself. He seems quite strange and not aware of the world around him.
