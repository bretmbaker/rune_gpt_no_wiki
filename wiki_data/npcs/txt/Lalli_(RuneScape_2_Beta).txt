Item: Lalli (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: Lalli was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He would have appeared in the original version of The Fremennik Trials, then known as "A Viking Quest". Presumably, he would have been found alongside the golden sheep and involved in one of the trials.
