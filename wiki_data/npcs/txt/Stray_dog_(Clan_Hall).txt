Item: Stray dog (Clan Hall)
Summary: Stray dog is a dog that occasionally appears outside of the gates of the Clan Hall when a player loads in. She is outside of the player's reach. Unlike the stray dogs in Varrock, she does not have a shoo option, although she does have a pet option. She also appears noticeably healthier and cleaner than other stray dogs.
