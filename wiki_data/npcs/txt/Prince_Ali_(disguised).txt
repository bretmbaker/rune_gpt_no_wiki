Item: Prince Ali (disguised)
Summary: During Prince Ali Rescue, Prince Ali escapes from jail by lightening his skin using paste, donning a wig, and wearing a pink skirt in order to make himself resemble Lady Keli. Due to a change in the quest released alongside Beneath Cursed Sands, this now happens off-screen, and the NPC is no longer used.
