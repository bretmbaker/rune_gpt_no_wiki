Item: Ali the Carter
Summary: Ali the Carter is a salesman and conman who operates in the dried-up town of Nardah, deep in the southern Kharidian Desert and perfectly south-east of Pollnivneach, where it is apparent Ali the Carter hailed from, given his name and examine info. Prior to completion of the Spirits of the Elid quest, Ali stands in the town square of Nardah and sells waterskins for a staggering 1,000 coins each and thus scamming the townspeople and making insane profits from the desperate locals, who have no other source of water.
