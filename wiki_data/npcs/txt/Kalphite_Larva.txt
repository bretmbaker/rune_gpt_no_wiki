Item: Kalphite Larva
Summary: Kalphite Larvae are the first stage of development in the lifecycle of the Kalphite, a species of large scarab-like insects native to the Kharidian Desert. They are at the lowest level in the Kalphite caste system and a member of the Kalphiscarabeinae family. The larvae, unlike its adult forms, are completely harmless to humans, and will usually retreat when it sees one. They cannot be fought, although wily cats can catch them in much the same way as rats.
