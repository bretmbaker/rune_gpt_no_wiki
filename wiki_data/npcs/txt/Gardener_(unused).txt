Item: Gardener (unused)
Summary: Gardeners were unreleased members of the Group of Advanced Gardeners that were added to the game files with the release of Farming. It is unknown where they were intended to appear, but presumably they would have protected players' Spirit Tree Patches; however, this feature was removed before launch. When it was re-added in an update in 2006, Frizzy Skernip, Praistan Ebola, and Yulf Squecks were added to watch over Spirit Tree Patches instead, and the gardeners were removed from the game. As a result, they have never been present in Old School RuneScape.
