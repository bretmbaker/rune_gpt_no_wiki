Item: Sir Percival
Summary: Sir Percival was a knight of Camelot, and was part of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. While searching for a set of legendary artefacts called the "Golden Boots of Arkanesses," he was kidnapped by goblins in northern Asgarnia. He became their slave, and was thrust into a sack and forgotten for over a day. Percival is rescued during the Holy Grail quest and succeeds his father, The Fisher King, as new king of the Fisher Realm. It is not known what happens to the Fisher King, though it is implied that he passes away. After the quest, King Percival can be found on the 1st floor[UK]2nd floor[US] of the castle to the south of fairy ring code BJR.
