Item: Fycie
Summary: Fycie is the daughter of Rantz. She has a brother named Bugs. She lives in Rantz's Cave, and sells feathers during Big Chompy Bird Hunting. In Recipe for Disaster, both Fycie and her brother Bugs use the ogre boat ride to get to Karamja. During some Treasure Trails, she has to be talked to. When doing so, she says 'Human done good!', and gives you your next clue, or the reward. One method of getting to her is to take a fairy ring to AKS and running east.
