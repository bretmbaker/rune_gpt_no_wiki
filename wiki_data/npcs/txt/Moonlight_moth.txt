Summary: The moonlight moth is a creature found in Neypotzli, in the basement of the Hunter Guild, and in the Ruins of Tapoyauik. Players can capture them with the Hunter skill at level 75 by using a butterfly net and jar. Players with level 85 Hunter can catch moonlight moths barehanded. Moonlight moths may be assigned as a hunter's rumour task starting at level 85 by Guild Hunters Gilman, Aco, or Wolf. There are a few variants of the moonlight moths in Neypotzli, only one of which can be caught.
