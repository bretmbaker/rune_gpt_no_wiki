Item: Ghost guard
Summary: Two Ghost guards watch over the energy barriers allowing access into Port Phasmatys, a ghost-town in northern Morytania. The guards make sure nobody enters the town without paying the toll of two ecto-tokens - the town's main currency - and require an amulet of ghostspeak to converse with. It is possible to right-click the barrier to enter the town by paying the ecto-tokens without needing a ghostspeak amulet. After completion of the Ghosts Ahoy quest, entry to the town is free, and players can pass without needing ecto-tokens.
