Item: Alfonse the waiter
Summary: Alfonse the waiter runs The Shrimp and Parrot in Brimhaven which sells food. He is a member of the Phoenix Gang and will help the player during the Heroes' Quest if they are in the gang. He also sells fish including cooked karambwan. Alfonse is quite well-mannered. This is odd for a resident of Brimhaven, known for its population of pirates and thieves.
