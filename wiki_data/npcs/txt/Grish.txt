Item: Grish
Summary: Grish is an ogre shaman who the player speaks with to begin the quest Zogre Flesh Eaters. He has no other use beyond this, but players can still talk to him and ask him questions about the ogres in Gu'Tanoth and about Rantz, who the player must speak with to begin Big Chompy Bird Hunting. When speaking to Grish to start Zogre Flesh Eaters he will give the player two Super restore potions and three cooked chompy birds.
