Item: Skavid
Summary: Skavids are an elusive race of small, clawed humanoid creatures that dwell in the Feldip Hills in small caves. They are forced to serve as slaves to the Ogre race around the city of Gu'Tanoth. Skavids can be found in their dark Skavid caves, where the player must explore in the Watchtower quest, though they need maps to find their way around the caves.
