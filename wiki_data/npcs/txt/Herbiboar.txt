Item: Herbiboar
Summary: The herbiboar is a creature that players can capture with 80 Hunter and 31 Herblore, granting between 1,950 and 2,461 Hunter experience. It can be caught by first tracking down footsteps left across Fossil Island, until reaching a point where the footsteps enter a burrow. Players can then kick the burrow, causing the herbiboar to appear and get stunned just outside the hole. Players may then harvest between one and three herbs off the herbiboar's back before it flees. Secateurs are not required to harvest the herbiboar, but having magic secateurs equipped will allow players to harvest an additional herb. This effect does apply when the magic secateurs are in the player's inventory.
