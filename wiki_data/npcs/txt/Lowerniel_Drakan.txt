Item: Lowerniel Drakan
Summary: Lord Lowerniel Vergidiyad Drakan is the vampyre dictator of Morytania. Drakan is a trueborn vampyre hailing from Vampyrium, brought to Gielinor alongside many of his kind by Zaros during the Second Age to contribute to the Zarosian Empire. Drakan later supported Zamorak in his rebellion against Zaros, and later led an army into the kingdom of Hallowvale, which was conquered by Drakan and his forces. Drakan then became the overlord and tyrant of the land he named Morytania, transforming its capital into a blood-farming ghetto and corrupting the entire land. His reign has been marred by violence, including, amongst countless other incidents,  the Misthalin - Morytania War, and the Morytania Campaign.[1]
