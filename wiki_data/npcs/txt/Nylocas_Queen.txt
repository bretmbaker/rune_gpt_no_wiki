Item: Nylocas Queen
Summary: The Nylocas Queen is a massive nylocas created by Verzik Vitur through her extensive breeding program in order to create "the nylocas to end all nylocas". The Nylocas Queen had been growing inside Verzik Vitur after she was bitten by a young prototype nylocas, with the Nylocas Queen presumably ending up killing Verzik, but assuming both her form and her nature.
