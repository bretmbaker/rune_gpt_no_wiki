Summary: Lord Iestin Edern Iorwerth is the older brother of a deceased mourner named Nissyen Edern. He is first mentioned in Edern's journal and later appears in Prifddinas. Some of Iestin's research has led him to the conclusion that Lord Iorwerth has somehow broken one of the 9 seals that Seren put in place to protect the Grand Library from the hands of men.
