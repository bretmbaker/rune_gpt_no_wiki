Item: Raulyn
Summary: Raulyn is a ghost located at the centre of the Slayer Tower's basement. He was a servant to Viggora, who built the tower long ago.
If players attempt to attack the monsters in this area, he will stop them from doing so, claiming the basement is only for those who have an active Slayer task.
