Item: Eblis
Summary: Eblis is a Zarosian mystic who plays a large role in the Desert Treasure I quest. During the quest, the player helps Eblis free the Mahjarrat Azzanadra from his prison in the Ancient Pyramid; to do this, the four Diamonds of Azzanadra must be collected, and to this end Eblis (with the player's help) enchants a number of mirrors to discern the diamonds' locations.
