Item: Chef (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: Chef was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He is an alternative version of Caleb from Family Crest. Although Caleb was also present in the game files, Chef's name and appearance more closely resemble the character as he appeared in RuneScape Classic. Although Caleb is marked as a Family Crest quest NPC, Chef is instead a generic shopkeeper from Catherby.
