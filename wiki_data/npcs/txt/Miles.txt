Item: Miles
Summary: Miles is the brother of Giles and Niles. Like his brothers, he may appear to initiate the Certer random event, in which he will ask players to identify an item, such as a fish, with three possible choices of what the object is. If the player correctly identifies the item, Miles will give the player a reward of either coins, a gem (uncut, up to diamond), a cosmic talisman, a half key, a spinach roll, or a kebab.
