Item: Saniboch
Summary: Saniboch is a tribesman who guards the entrance to Brimhaven Dungeon. Players must pay 875 coins to him to gain entrance, or a one-off fee of 1,000,000 coins (equivalent to 1,143 entry fees) for permanent free access. An axe is needed in order to navigate the dungeon. Only players who are prepared should enter, as it is very dangerous and contains some very powerful monsters, the strongest of which are Steel dragons.
