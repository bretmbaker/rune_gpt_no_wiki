Item: Light creature
Summary: Light creatures are found near Juna in a chasm within the Lumbridge Swamp Caves. They are used to get across the chasm by using a sapphire lantern on them during the Tears of Guthix quest. During and after While Guthix Sleeps, they can also be used to go down the chasm and into the Ancient Guthixian Temple, where tormented demons reside.
