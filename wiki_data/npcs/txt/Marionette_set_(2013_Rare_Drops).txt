Item: Marionette set (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The marionette set was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a red, green, and blue marionette. This was the first introduction of marionettes in Old School RuneScape, though they were later made available as part of the annual Christmas holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the easter ring.
