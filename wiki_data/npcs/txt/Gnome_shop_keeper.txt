Item: Gnome shop keeper
Summary: The Gnome shop keeper is an used character who was added to the game during the RuneScape 2 beta. Presumably, he would have been a generic character in the Tree Gnome Stronghold or Tree Gnome Village, similar to the Gnome banker. He has a very similar appearance to Bolkoy, who runs the general store in the Tree Gnome Village.
