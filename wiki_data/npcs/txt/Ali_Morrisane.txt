Item: Ali Morrisane
Summary: Ali Morrisane can be found in the north-eastern part of Al Kharid's market, not far from the cactus patch. He is a greedy, cunning, and (in)famous Pollnivnian merchant who is always on the lookout for new business opportunities and will often sell useless junk to players without the player's consent. He is the owner and namesake of Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises Ltd., a company engaging in a variety of activities, and the brain behind the magic carpet fleet operating in the desert.
