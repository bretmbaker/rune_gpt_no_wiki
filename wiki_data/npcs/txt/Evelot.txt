Item: Evelot
Summary: Evelot is a member of the Khazard Army fought during the Secrets of the North quest. She is the prime suspect in the murder of Ceril Carnillean, as evidenced by an amulet bearing her name and the symbol of the Khazard Army found at the crime scene. After defeating her, she tells you she was hired to break into the Carnillean mansion to steal a certain scroll, but insists she was not Ceril's killer. She then delivered the scroll to the Hazeel cultists, only to discover they had not hired her to retrieve the scroll.
