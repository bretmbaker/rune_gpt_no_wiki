Item: Ghost farmer
Summary: The Ghost farmer is an unused NPC who could originally be found at the farm near Port Phasmatys. He served no purpose other than to tend over the undead chickens and cows. With the release of Farming, Alice was added to the farm, and eventually the Ghost farmer was replaced by a new character called Alice's husband when the Animal Magnetism quest was released. As a result, he has never been present in Old School RuneScape.
