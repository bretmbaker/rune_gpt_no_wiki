Item: Zaff
Summary: Zaff is a salesman who owns Zaff's Superior Staves in the city of Varrock. He is located in his shop just north-west of Varrock centre. His shop is often visited because it is one of the few places that sells battlestaves, the other being Baba Yaga on Lunar Isle. He is also involved in the What Lies Below quest. During the quest, players can summon him by using a beacon ring and Zaff's instructions.
