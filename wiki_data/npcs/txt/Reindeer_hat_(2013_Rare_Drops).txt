Item: Reindeer hat (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The reindeer hat was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a reindeer hat. This was the first introduction of the reindeer hat in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Christmas holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the bunny ears.
