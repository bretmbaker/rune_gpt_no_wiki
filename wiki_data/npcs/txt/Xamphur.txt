Item: Xamphur
Summary: Xamphur is one of Xeric's closest comrades that players must fight during A Kingdom Divided. Xamphur mainly attacks using grasp spells, which can bind the player if damage is taken; praying Protect from Magic will greatly reduce any damage done by his grasp spells. He uses Protect from Magic himself during the fight, thus rendering him immune to Magic spells. The fight begins with a number of marks on the floor, and walking over these will inflict a Mark of Darkness upon on the player, causing Xamphur's grasp spells to become twice as effective, and cause corruption to occur twice as often if they get corrupted by one of the other mechanics mentioned below. Avoid the marks to fully avoid this effect.
