Item: Duke (monkey)
Summary: Duke replaces Kruk as head of the Ninja Monkey Guards of Marim after the events of Monkey Madness II. He can be spoken to post-quest to receive 2 x 50,000 XP rewards in Magic, Ranged, Attack, Defence, Strength, or Hitpoints if you also received the experience reward from Daero after finishing Monkey Madness I. He can be found on the east hill above the main gate of Ape Atoll. This hill can be reached by walking up the west hill and climbing up the ladder to access a bridge leading to the east hill.
