Item: Arancini
Summary: Arancini is an araxyte that can be found in a secret room in the Morytania Spider Cave. She is part of a series of tunnels that require multiple drops from Araxxor to navigate, ultimately leading to a man that will change a player's amulet of rancour into an ornamented silver version. Your pet must be in the room (call follower) before talking to Arancini or you will have to complete the prior steps again.
