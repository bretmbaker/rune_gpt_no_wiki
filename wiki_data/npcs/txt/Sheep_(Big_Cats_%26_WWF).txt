Item: Sheep (Big Cats & WWF)
Summary: Sheep were used during the Big Cats & WWF event as part of the snow leopard habitat restoration. The sheep were located in a pen that had broken fencing that needed to be repaired. The sheep were decorative and couldn't be interacted with, since they were inside the pen.
