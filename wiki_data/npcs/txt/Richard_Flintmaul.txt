Item: Richard Flintmaul
Summary: Richard Flintmaul is an unused non-player character released with the Kebos Lowlands. Presumably, he is a citizen of Lovakengj. It is possible that he was meant to be involved in The Forsaken Tower quest alongside Undor and Thirus, but was never added to the game for unknown reasons.
