Item: Seia, Teoki of Ranul
Summary: Seia is a Teoki within the Sect of Ranul, found in the Fortis Colosseum entrance. She will not converse with the player for long, explaining that she is busy.[1] This is likely due to the amount of death that occurs in the Colosseum, since Ranul is associated with guiding those who pass away to the Gates of Mictl, or the afterlife, and his followers hold responsibility over funerary rites.[2]
