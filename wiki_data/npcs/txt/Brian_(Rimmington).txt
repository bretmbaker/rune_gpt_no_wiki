Item: Brian (Rimmington)
Summary: Brian is a non-player character who runs Brian's Archery Supplies in Rimmington. He was not originally there when Rimmington was added to the game; he was added when more bows and arrows became available to free players. His prices are slightly higher than most archery shops, and his poor location means he is not used nearly as the archery shops in places such as Catherby and Varrock.
