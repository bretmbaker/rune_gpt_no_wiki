Item: Fishing spot (The Stranglewood)
Summary: A fishing spot can be found by a small dock in the south-western area of The Stranglewood. Besides raw pike, the fishing spot can also give a variety of odd items such as newspapers, old boots, and acorns. This spot gains resources notably much slower than most other fishing spots in the game, and therefore is not recommended for training Fishing, not even when trying to obtain raw pike or caskets.
