Item: Viggora
Summary: General Viggora was once a powerful and vicious human warrior of the late Second Age. He was one of the few Zarosian generals, and the only one of them to be human. He built the Slayer Tower also known as Viggora's Folly, a massive and dark tower of Morytania that holds many horrific beasts that require a special technique in order to be slain. Despite being a Zarosian general during the Second Age, he eventually stopped following Zaros, and became a follower of Zamorak, who was another Zarosian general at that time. Viggora was a powerful general despite being a human, having possessed a powerful chainmace and used it during his conquests.
