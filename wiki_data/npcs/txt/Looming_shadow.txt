Item: Looming shadow
Summary: The Looming shadow can be seen on the ground beneath Glough's airship during Monkey Madness II. Glough and Assistant Le Smith use the airship to launch an attack on the Grand Tree. While the airship successfully takes off from Ape Atoll, the cabin is overwhelmed by the tortured gorillas on the ship causing it to crash north of the Tree Gnome Stronghold.
