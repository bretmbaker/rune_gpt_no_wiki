Item: Verac the Defiled
Summary: Verac the Defiled is the youngest of the six Barrows brothers. Verac's crypt is located to the north-west of the Barrows area. He uses melee equipment, which make him vulnerable to Magic attacks. Verac's set effect is Defiler, which gives him a 25% chance per attack to ignore Defence and armour bonuses. In addition, unlike players who use his set, Verac's set effect penetrates through protection prayers.
