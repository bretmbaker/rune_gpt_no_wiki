Item: Tarik
Summary: Tarik is an archaeologist standing outside the Jalsavrah Pyramid in Sophanem. He explains to the player about the pyramid next to him, where the Pyramid Plunder minigame takes place and the dangers players attempting to loot it will face, and then goes on to talk about selling artefacts that you gain throughout the minigame to Simon Templeton for money. He also tells that he has heard a rumour about a valuable magic sceptre to be found in the pyramid, which used to belong to one of Tumeken's sons.
