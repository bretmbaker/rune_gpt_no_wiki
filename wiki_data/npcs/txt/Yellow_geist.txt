Item: Yellow geist
Summary: Yellow geists were found in the 2013 Halloween event by shooting wooden ducks with a ghost buster 500 loaded with a white destabiliser. The yellow geist could then be busted with a yellow destabiliser. After busting 3 of one type of geist you could collect one piece of the skeleton outfit from Diango.
