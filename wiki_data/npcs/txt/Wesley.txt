Item: Wesley
Summary: Wesley is a small man found outside Zahur's home in Nardah, just south of the fountain. For 50 coins per item (noted items work), he will crush items that require the use of a pestle and mortar, such as unicorn horns, blue dragon scales, bird nests and chocolate bars. He can crush all items in one go, so if a player is willing to pay, you can save considerable time using him instead of crushing the items yourself.
