Item: Lubufu
Summary: Lubufu is an old fisherman found near the Brimhaven player-owned house portal, marked with a  icon. He holds the secret to catching karambwan and is the karambwan supplier for the nearby restaurant The Shrimp and Parrot. He introduces himself as the son of Kedoaba, brother of Kedenda and second cousin twice removed of Ibeli. Having never found a suitable wife, Lubufu has not sired any children, to his own regret, fearing the secret to catching karambwan will die with him.
