Item: Ingrid Hradson
Summary: Ingrid Hradson features in Olaf's Quest. She is the wife of Olaf Hradson and mother of Volf Olafson. After giving her crude carving she seems sceptical of your story regarding Olaf's success but will reward you with freshly-baked bread.
She lives just east of main hall in Rellekka, wandering around the well.
