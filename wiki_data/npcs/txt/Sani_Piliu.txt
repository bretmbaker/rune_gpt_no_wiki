Item: Sani Piliu
Summary: Sani Piliu was the only known female member of the Myreque. Her family was slain by the Vampyres when she was nine. After surviving on her own devices, she bumped into Veliaf Hurtz in the Hair of the Dog tavern. She joined the Myreque to avenge the death of her family and to eventually escape across the River Salve. She didn't succeed in her goal as she was killed by Vanstrom Klause during Vanstrom's raid of the Myreque's Canifis headquarters, along with Harold Evans.
