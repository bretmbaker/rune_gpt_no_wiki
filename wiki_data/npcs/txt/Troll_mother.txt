Item: Troll mother
Summary: The troll mother is the mother of the troll child near the Ice Gate north of Trollheim. She, along with her husband, were captured and frozen by Kamil. Dialogue with the troll father suggests he had found the Ice diamond, not knowing what it was and planned to return it to its owner. However, when they attempted to, Kamil thought that they had stolen it from him and froze the two as punishment. She is freed along with her husband after their son told the adventurer that they had the diamond. After the quest, she can be found near the Ice Gate, along with her husband and son.
