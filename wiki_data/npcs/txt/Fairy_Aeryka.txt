Item: Fairy Aeryka
Summary: Fairy Aeryka is a fairy who resides just outside the permanent Puro-Puro entrance portal, a crop circle in the Zanaris wheat field. When talking to her, she tells you of Puro-Puro and a bit about implings. If you ask her about dragon metal, she will claim it was the Necrosyrtes Dragonkin that created the red metal.
