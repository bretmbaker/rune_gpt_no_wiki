Item: Harold Evans
Summary: Harold Evans was a member of Mort Myre order of The Myreque, working to help free Morytania from the clutches of Lord Drakan. Harold was the group's main fighter, and he provided close combat assistance for his allies, often bearing the brunt of damage and was normally in the thick of the battle. He showed promise, but was slain by Vanstrom Klause during Vanstrom's raid of the Myreque's Canifis headquarters, along with Sani Piliu.
