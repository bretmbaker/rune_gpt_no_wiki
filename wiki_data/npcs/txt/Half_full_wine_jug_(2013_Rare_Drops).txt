Item: Half full wine jug (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The half full wine jug was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a half full wine jug. This was the second introduction of the half full wine jug in Old School RuneScape following the 2013 Goblin Invasion. It was later made available as part of various midsummer and birthday holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the zombie head.
