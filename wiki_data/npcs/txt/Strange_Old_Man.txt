Item: Strange Old Man
Summary: The Strange Old Man can be found digging in the Barrows mounds. As his title suggests, he is a very peculiar individual with an obsession for digging, often saying strange things. The crumbling tome is occasionally received when he is talked to. Players can also ask him to condense the warnings when entering the Barrows crypts into only one message.
