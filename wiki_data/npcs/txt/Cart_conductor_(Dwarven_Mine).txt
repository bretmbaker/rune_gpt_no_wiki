Item: Cart conductor (Dwarven Mine)
Summary: The cart conductor is a dwarf in the Dwarven Mine. Like other cart conductors, he was hired by the Consortium to ensure that the Keldagrim minecart system is running smoothly. Despite the minecart system being a members only feature, this cart conductor is visible and can be talked to in free-to-play, although he will not sell you tickets or allow you to use the minecart system.
