Item: Jaraah
Summary: Jaraah also known as "The Butcher" is one of the two surgeons at the Emir's Arena. Jaraah, along with Surgeon General Tafani, and the two nurses (Sabreen and A'abla), are able to heal players, restoring all their hitpoints for no cost, but cannot cure poison. Players must right-click (and choose "Heal" from the Choose Option menu) or talk to these NPCs to benefit from this.
