Item: Mairin
Summary: Mairin is a mermaid located in the underwater section of Fossil Island. She runs a market which sells a variety of underwater-related items, bought with mermaid's tears. She can also train the player's Agility and Thieving in exchange for glistening tears. If players exchange them for experience with more than 700 glistening tears in the inventory, the excess will be discarded. Both tears are obtained by searching chests and clams in the mermaid's domain.
