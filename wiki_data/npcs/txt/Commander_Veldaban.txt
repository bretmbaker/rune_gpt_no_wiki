Item: Commander Veldaban
Summary: Veldaban is the commander of the Keldagrim division of the Dwarven Black Guard, the elite military and police regiment of the dwarves. Commander Veldaban can be found in the headquarters, west of the Keldagrim bank. As Veldaban is a commander of an elite dwarven force, he may appear harsh at first, but is actually a warm-hearted individual with the city's best interests at heart. He is always aware of all that takes place within the city and will always justify his actions while not causing unnecessary victims. He is kind and cares for all inhabitants of the city, especially the poor dwarves in the East. Veldaban is particularly suspicious of The Red Axe and their brutal methods of business. Much of Veldaban's early history remains unknown. His father is Dondakan, a rich and old miner.
