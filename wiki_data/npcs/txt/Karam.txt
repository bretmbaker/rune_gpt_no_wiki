Item: Karam
Summary: Karam is a member of the 10th Squad who appears in invisible armour, similar to the ghostly robes. He states that their mage Zooknock is giving him invisibility, and that he is trying to find a way to free his fellow gnome members from the Marim jail. Karam will instantly kill any monkeys that try to apprehend the player, as long as he is able to see the player and the monkeys trying to apprehend them.
