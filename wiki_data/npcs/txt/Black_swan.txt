Item: Black swan
Summary: The Black swan is an unused black variant of swans. It was added with the graphical update of Falador in 2006, and presumably would have been found alongside regular swans in Falador Park and the moat around the White Knights' Castle. For unknown reasons, the black swan was never added to the game, and cannot currently be found anywhere.
