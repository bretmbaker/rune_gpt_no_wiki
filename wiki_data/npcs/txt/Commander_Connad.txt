Summary: Commander Connad is a barbarian located on the main floor of the Barbarian Outpost.

There, players can spend points on levelling up their roles, buying penance gear, or gambling for items. Players can also talk to him to get their wave in the minigame reset to 1, or use penance gear on him to receive a point refund equal to 80% of the purchase price. he will not refund (broken) items, however he will refund locked items, consuming the trouver parchment in the process, so it is recommended to unlock any locked items before refunding them.
