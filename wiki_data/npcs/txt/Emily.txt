Item: Emily
Summary: Emily works with Kaylee and Tina as a bartender (and most likely the owner) at the Rising Sun Inn in Falador. She sells Asgarnian ale, Wizard's mind bomb, and Dwarven stout which can all be bought for 3 coins each. If you ask for a drink but do not have enough coins, she gets angry and yells at you.
