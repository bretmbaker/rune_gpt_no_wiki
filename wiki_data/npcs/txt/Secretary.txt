Item: Secretary
Summary: The Secretary is an unused NPC added alongside the release of Keldagrim. The name and examine suggest that she would have been the coordinator of the Keldagrim tasks minigame. However, the Secretary was ultimately not added to the game, and players receive tasks by speaking directly to the clients instead.
