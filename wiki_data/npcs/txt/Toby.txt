Item: Toby
Summary: Toby is the taskmaster for the Varrock Diaries and is located just south-east of the centre of Varrock. Players can begin the Varrock Diaries by speaking to him. He also awards players the Varrock armour for completing easy, medium, hard and elite tasks. The hammer he is carrying may be in reference to the fact that the Varrock armour provides enhancements for mining and smelting.
