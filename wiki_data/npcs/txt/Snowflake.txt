Item: Snowflake
Summary: Snowflake is an ice troll princess who resides in Weiss. She is the daughter of Mother, who despite the name happens to be her father and also the ruler of Weiss. She features heavily in the Making Friends with My Arm quest, where she becomes romantically involved with My Arm. Unlike many other ice trolls, particularly those loyal to Mother, she is interested in science and loathes combat. Her father is opposed to her marrying someone who is not a warrior, because he feels that the successor to his reign must be someone who is a proven warrior. After Mother's demise, she eventually marries My Arm and succeeds her father as the new ruler.
