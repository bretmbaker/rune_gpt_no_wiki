Item: Oozing barrier
Summary: Oozing Barriers are barriers in the Pit of Pestilence, the third level of the Stronghold of Security. They will ask players questions about account security before allowing them to pass, unless the Box of Health has been claimed. Passage through a door from a room filled with monsters is always immediate, however, allowing one to escape combat if needed.
