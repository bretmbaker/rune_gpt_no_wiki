Item: Clan Guard
Summary: The Clan Guard is an unused NPC who was presumably intended to guard the entrance to the Moon Clan. He would have been the only male capable of using Lunar magic except the Sirsal Bankers. For unknown reasons, he was not added to the game, and therefore has never been present in Old School RuneScape.
