Item: Head Servant (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: The Head Servant was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He would have appeared in the original version of Death Plateau. Presumably players would have been required to speak to him about gaining access to the storage room, following which he would direct players to speak to the guard.
