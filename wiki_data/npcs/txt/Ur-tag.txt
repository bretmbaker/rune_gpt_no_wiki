Item: Ur-tag
Summary: Ur-tag is the current elected head of the cave goblins. Unlike most societies in Gielinor, no single figure rules over all the Dorgeshuun, and Ur-tag is merely the head of the elected council. He is one of the oldest of the cave goblins, but was also one of the first to see the lands above when he went to sign the treaty with Duke Horacio.
