Item: Siamun
Summary: Siamun is a dyer living in Sophanem. He can be found between the building with the spinning wheel and a silk stall. During Icthlarin's Little Helper, he is quite angry with the player and either refuses to talk, or rudely tells him to get lost. After the quest and speaking to Ali Morisane, he becomes less hostile and will speak to the player about the Rogue Trader minigame.
