Item: Irena
Summary: Irena is a woman from Al Kharid, and the mother of Ana, an eager explorer/tourist. Recently, she went down into the Kharidian Desert and Irena hasn't seen her since, so she waits and sobs at the gates of the Shantay Pass, waiting for Ana to return, and waiting for an adventurer to arrive and help her. A player can talk to her to begin The Tourist Trap.
