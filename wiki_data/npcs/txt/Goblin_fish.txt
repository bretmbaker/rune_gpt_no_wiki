Item: Goblin fish
Summary: Goblin fish or cave pond loaches are a species of subterranean fish native to the underground city of Dorgesh-Kaan. They are named so either because they are found in the goblin city or because they somewhat resemble cave goblins (pale green skin and bulging eyes). A single Goblin fish can also be found at the start of the River Dougne, north of Baxtorian Falls.
