Item: Knight (Enakhra's Lament)
Summary: Knights of Avarrocka (modern-day Varrock) were a small group of soldiers sent to slay Enakhra and destroy her temple.[1] However, they failed, being quickly slain. One of their members, Pentyn, was kept alive in order to fuel a spell trapping Akthanakos, being tortured and starved for thousands of years.[2]
