Item: High Priest of Scabaras
Summary: The High Priest of Scabaras is encountered in the Beneath Cursed Sands quest, found in the Scabaras Dungeon beneath the Ruins of Ullek. He is the current of a long line of Scabarite High Priests who all have been corrupted and manipulated by Amascut, the Devourer across the centuries. Thanks to the adventurer he is finally relieved of Amascut's influence, after which he explains how he and the rest of the Sect of Scabaras were forced into helping Amascut by hunting and capturing the four minor gods: Apmeken, Crondis, Het and even their founder-god Scabaras as well as causing the infestations of locusts and plague frogs and poisoning the cows of Sophanem.
