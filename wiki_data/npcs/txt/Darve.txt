Item: Darve
Summary: Darve is Movario's bodyguard and a member of the Khazard Army. He is found in the Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon after Temple of Ikov is completed. When pickpocketing Movario, Darve is the one who hits the player if they fail. Darve is shown to be overly impatient and intellectually lacking.
