Item: Ignatius Vulcan
Summary: Ignatius Vulcan is a master firemaker, who wanders around the forest north-east of the Sorcerer's Tower, south of Seers' Village. He makes fires in a random area, but when the fire is gone, no ashes remain. If you have a conversation with him, he implies that he neglected his combat skills, as well as Mining, and questing, in order to become a master of Firemaking.
