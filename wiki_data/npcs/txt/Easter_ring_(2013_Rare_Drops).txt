Item: Easter ring (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The easter ring was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with an easter ring. This was the first introduction of the easter ring in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Easter holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the marionette set.
