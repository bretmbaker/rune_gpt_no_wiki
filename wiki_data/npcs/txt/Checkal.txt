Item: Checkal
Summary: Checkal is one of the members of Willow's gang. Players need to recruit him to join in the expedition during the quest Below Ice Mountain. Checkal is a strongman and very fond of his muscles, and will refuse to help unless the player commits themselves to a tough training session with Atlas. Following this, he helps clear a load of rocks blocking the entrance to the Ruins of Camdozaal.
