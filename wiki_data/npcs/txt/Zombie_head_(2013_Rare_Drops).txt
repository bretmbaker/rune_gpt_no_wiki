Item: Zombie head (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The zombie head was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a zombie head. This was the first introduction of the zombie head in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Halloween holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the half full wine jug.
