Item: Ali the Operator
Summary: Ali the Operator is a member of the Menaphite Thugs, an evil group of Menaphites banished from Menaphos because of their worship of the goddess Amascut, The Devourer. Ali and the rest of his gang seek to cause massive destruction throughout the world in her name, but they are greatly hindered by the bandits, a separate gang that control much of Pollnivneach. Their ultimate goal is world domination, although this currently seems unlikely.
