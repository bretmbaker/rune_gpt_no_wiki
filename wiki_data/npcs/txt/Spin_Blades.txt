Item: Spin Blades
Summary: Spin Blades are obstacles found in the Rogues' Den minigame. The spin blades move in an anticlockwise circle and can be avoided by waiting in alcoves. The spin blades are only found in the north-east corner of the Rogues' Den, which is on the longest path to the centre of the maze and therefore rarely visited by players.
