Item: Rug Station Attendant
Summary: The Rug Station Attendant could previously be found running the Magic carpet station outside Menaphos. He was stationed there to wait until Menaphos would reopen, and in the meantime had to try to think of reasons for Ali Morrisane to keep the station open. However, the Rug Station Attendant was removed from Old School RuneScape in a hidden update in 2013 and replaced by a normal Rug Merchant, suggesting that Menaphos will never reopen.
