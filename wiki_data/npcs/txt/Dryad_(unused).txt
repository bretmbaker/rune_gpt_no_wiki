Item: Dryad (unused)
Summary: Dryads are a cut race planned to be added to RuneScape 2. Unlike other cut creatures, they were most likely scrapped very early on. They lack any interaction options and their combat level is the default, while they were not mentioned as one of the planned updates in March 2004.
