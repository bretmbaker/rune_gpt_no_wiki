Item: Soldier (recruits)
Summary: Soldiers are new recruits to the Shayzien Army training under the Drill Sergeant in the Shayzien Encampment. They cannot be interacted with and periodically perform the star jump, sit up, and push up emotes, as well as punch, kick, block, or deflect, depending on what the drill sergeant last shouted out. They only do each of the emotes for a fraction of the time that the player does the emote for, so they never complete a full sit-up or push-up. This is not their fault however, as the drill sergeant also does not show the full motion for either exercise when demonstrating an example.
