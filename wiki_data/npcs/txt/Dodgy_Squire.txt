Item: Dodgy Squire
Summary: The Dodgy Squire can be found at the Void Knights' Outpost and will refund 80% of the original value of Commendation points in exchange for Void Knight equipment pieces, excluding the Void seal. He is located just north of the bank. He will not accept (broken) items, nor any of the ornamented items. He will accept locked items, but the trouver parchment is not refunded, so it is recommended to unlock the item before refunding it.
