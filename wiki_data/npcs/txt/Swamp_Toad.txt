Item: Swamp Toad
Summary: Swamp toads are creatures found near the swamp south of the Castle Wars arena. They can be filled with swamp gas using ogre bellows to create a bloated toad, which is used as bait when trying to kill a chompy bird. They are also used in the quest Mourning's End Part I, in which they are injected with dye to produce coloured toads. They occasionally say "Ribbit" or "Croak" in public chat.
