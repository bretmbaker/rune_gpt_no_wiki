Item: Barbarian guard
Summary: The Barbarian guard is one of five NPCs in the Barbarian Outpost. He does not let players in the Barbarian Outpost until they complete the Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl miniquest. Unlike many other barbarians, he cannot be attacked. He stands next to the gate of the Barbarian Outpost, just east of the Barbarian Assault building.
