Item: Rakkar
Summary: Rakkar is the sole inhabitant of the Fishing Hamlet. He has gone insane and is unable to coherently form a sentence. This was because, according to the smelly journal, he was "made an example of" when he attempted to throw the snakestone, an artefact of unknown origin, back into the ocean.
