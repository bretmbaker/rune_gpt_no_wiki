Item: Mage of Zamorak
Summary: Herbert, the Mage of Zamorak, is a member of the Zamorak Magical Institute, and stands around the Southern Wilderness mining site and at the Altar of Zamorak in Varrock. He sells runes in his shop, Battle Runes, and teleports players into the Abyss (resulting in a drain of all Prayer points) once the Enter the Abyss miniquest has been completed. He can teleport players even if they are affected by Tele Block.
