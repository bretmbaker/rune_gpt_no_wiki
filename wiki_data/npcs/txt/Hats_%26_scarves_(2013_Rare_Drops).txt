Item: Hats & scarves (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: Hats & scarves were items that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a full set of hats and scarves. This was the first introduction of the hats and scarves in Old School RuneScape, though they were later made available as part of the annual Christmas holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the rubber chicken.
