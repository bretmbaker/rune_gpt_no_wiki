Item: Pirate Jackie the Fruit
Summary: Pirate Jackie the Fruit can be found at the Brimhaven Agility Arena entrance. She runs the Agility Arena Store, exchanging the tickets and vouchers obtained in the arena for various rewards, consisting of valuable herbs, amylase packs, Agility experience, and the expensive pirate's hook. The amount of Agility experience received can be increased by 10% by wearing Karamja gloves 2 or higher. Players can also use graceful outfit pieces that have been recoloured blue on her to revert them to their default colouring, although this does not refund any tickets.
