Item: Gnome pilot (historical)
Summary: Gnome pilots were gnomes who could originally be found piloting the gnome gliders. With the release of the revamped Gnome Restaurant minigame, they were replaced by four updated pilots with unique names on 7 August 2006. However, one pilot remained at the crashed glider west of the Digsite, until he too was replaced by an embarrassed Captain Errdo in a hidden update in January 2007. As a result, they have never been present in Old School RuneScape.
