Item: Tolna
Summary: Tolna Talvoy is the child of Launa and Brana Talvoy. When he was young, he left home as he wanted something greater than what he had.[1] He heard rumours of a lost civilisation east of Varrock and went in search of it, but when he reached the site, a rift opened up in the ground and swallowed him.[2]
