Item: Eadgar
Summary: "Mad" Eadgar lives in a cave at the top of Trollheim. He plays a very small part in the Troll Stronghold quest, where players free him from his cell. He also plays a central role in Eadgar's Ruse, acting as an advisor to the player, helping them craft a ruse with a parrot to fool the trolls into believing it to be a human.
