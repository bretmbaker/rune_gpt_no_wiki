Item: Gertrude
Summary: Gertrude Fairweather[1] is a woman living in a house just west of Varrock. She is the starting point for both the Gertrude's Cat and Ratcatchers quests. Additionally, once your cat has become Overgrown, she will sell you kittens for 100 but keep in mind you can only have one kitten at a time. When you have a normal cat in your inventory or in your bank she won't give you a kitten. When you store your normal cats in your POH, she will sell you a new kitten. The colour of the kitten is random unless you have an activated ring of charos, then you will be able to charm Gertrude into letting you choose the colour of the kitten. Doing so the first time will complete a medium Varrock Diary task.
