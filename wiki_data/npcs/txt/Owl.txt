Item: Owl
Summary: Owls are birds that can be found roaming the third floor of the Hallowed Sepulchre in Darkmeyer. They are spectral creatures, symbols of the wise; they are blessed by Saradomin and the wisdom of ages long past. They are the watchers of the Hallowed Sepulchre, and the last defence against unseen evils. They accompany the Knight of the Owl in service of Zachariah, Justiciar of the Owl.[1]
