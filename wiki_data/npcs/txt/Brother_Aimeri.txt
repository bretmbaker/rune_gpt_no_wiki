Item: Brother Aimeri
Summary: Brother Aimeri is a travelling monk found south of the Spider's Den in the Forthos Dungeon, by the entrance to Sarachnis' lair. Travelling from the Kingdom of Varlamore, he came to the temple to uncover its secrets, believing Ralos, the god of the sun in which most people from Varlamore follow, may have originated from there.
