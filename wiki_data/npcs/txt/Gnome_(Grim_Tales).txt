Item: Gnome (Grim Tales)
Summary: Gnomes are unused NPCs that are stuck inside of cages. Presumably, they would have been found underneath the Witch's House in Taverley near Winkin, and could have been spoken to. However, the gnomes were never added and the other cages are currently empty. As a result, they have never been present in Old School RuneScape.
