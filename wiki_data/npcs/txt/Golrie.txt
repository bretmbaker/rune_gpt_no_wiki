Item: Golrie
Summary: Golrie is a gnome found in the jail of the Tree Gnome Village dungeon. He locked himself in a room to avoid some hobgoblins, but managed to leave the key to unlock the door elsewhere, outside the room. He was not planning on leaving until the hobgoblins departed, but does ask the player to help him solve his dilemma in the Waterfall Quest.
