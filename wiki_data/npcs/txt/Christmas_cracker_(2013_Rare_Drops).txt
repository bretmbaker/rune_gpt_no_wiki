Item: Christmas cracker (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The christmas cracker was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a christmas cracker. This was the first introduction of the christmas cracker in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of annual Christmas holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the war ship during the final week of 2013 rare drops.
