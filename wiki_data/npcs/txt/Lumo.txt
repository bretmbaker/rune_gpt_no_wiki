Item: Lumo
Summary: Lumo is a member of the 10th Squad who is imprisoned in the jail in Marim, Ape Atoll. He and his squad were sent by King Narnode Shareen to oversee the decommissioning of the Shipyard on Karamja, following Glough's defeat. However, the gnome gliders the squad were using as transport were caught in a strong wind, causing them to crash on Crash Island. Lumo accompanied Sergeant Garkor to the nearby Ape Atoll. However, he and two of his squad, Carado and Bunkdo, were captured by the simian natives and thrown in jail.
