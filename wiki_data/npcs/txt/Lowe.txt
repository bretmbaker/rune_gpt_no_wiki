Item: Lowe
Summary: Lowe is the owner of Lowe's Archery Emporium, found in Varrock just east of the general store. He sells ranging equipment including bronze through adamant arrows, bronze bolts, crossbows, and a variety of shortbows and longbows. The higher level equipment there is, the less there will usually be in stock, since it is higher in demand.
