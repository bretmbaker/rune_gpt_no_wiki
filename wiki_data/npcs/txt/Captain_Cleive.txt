Item: Captain Cleive
Summary: Captain Cleive is a non-player character located in the Lizardman Caves underneath the Lizardman Settlement, which is directly east of Mount Quidamortem. If players attempt to attack the lizardman shamans in this area, he will stop them from doing so, claiming the area is only for those who have lizardmen as a Slayer task. He is a Captain of the Shayzien Guard, and is one of Nieve's many relatives.
