Item: Monkey Archer (teaser)
Summary: Monkey Archer was a monkey that showed up in the Tree Gnome Stronghold the week before the release of Monkey Madness II as a teaser for the quest. The monkey archer would appear briefly near the central bank and could be talked to for dialogue hinting a future monkey attack. The monkey could only be seen after completion of Monkey Madness I.
