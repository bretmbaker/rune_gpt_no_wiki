Item: Dead Monk
Summary: A Dead Monk is encountered during the Devious Minds quest. Near the end of the quest, after witnessing an Assassin steal a relic from Entrana's church, the player returns to Paterdomus, where they had been assisting a hooded monk in his work. Upon arriving, they find a dead monk lying outside the temple, evidently having been killed by powerful magic.
