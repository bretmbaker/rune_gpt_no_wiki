Item: Wandering impling
Summary: The Wandering impling is a special NPC located in the wheat field in Zanaris. When talked to, he will show the location of the random Crop circle to Puro-Puro. He will not tell the name of the location, but a short cutscene will play to show it. The Wandering impling looks similar to an Essence impling, but with red robes instead of blue.
