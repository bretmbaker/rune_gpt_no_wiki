Item: Monkey boy
Summary: The Monkey boy was a monkey who could be found in Varrock Square on a members' world. He was the nephew of Daga and advertised his scimitar stall on Ape Atoll, which was selling the newly released Dragon Scimitar. If the player talked to him while holding a dragon scimitar, he would make a self-deprecating remark.
