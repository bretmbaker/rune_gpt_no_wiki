Item: Lord Alexei Jovkai
Summary: Lord Alexei Jovkai is a trueborn vampyre found in the south-western area of Darkmeyer. He is the head of House Jovkai. Vanstrom Klause believes that he has "weird tendencies", but this is due to him being a member of House Jovkai, who prefer the taste of love and as such treat their blood tithes with kindness and tenderness. He keeps his purchases in a prison north of the Arboretum.
