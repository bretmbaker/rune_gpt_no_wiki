Item: Corrupted scavenger
Summary: The corrupted scavenger is found in the creature keeper room within the Chambers of Xeric. It is blocking the path, and needs to be removed from its spot by feeding it until it is full. The amount of players in the raid will determine how many cavern grubs are needed to make it full.
