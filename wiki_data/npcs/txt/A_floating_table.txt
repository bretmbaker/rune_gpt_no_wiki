Item: A floating table
Summary: A floating table was one of the five types of possessed toys found in the 2013 Halloween event. Shooting the table with a ghost buster 500 loaded with a white destabiliser would turn it into a blue geist, which could then be dismissed by shooting it with a blue destabiliser. After busting 3 of one type of geist, Diango would reward you with one piece of the skeleton outfit.
