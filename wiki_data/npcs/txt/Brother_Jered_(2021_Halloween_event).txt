Item: Brother Jered (2021 Halloween event)
Summary: Brother Jered is a monk at the Edgeville Monastery. Presumably to allow all players to participate in the 2021 Halloween event without requiring players to acquire 31 Prayer to access the upper floor of the monastery, Brother Jered may also be found with paperwork on the monastery floors on the ground floor[UK]1st floor[US] during the event. However, Brother Jered is unable to offer his help to the player (blessing holy symbols or selling prayer capes) on the ground floor[UK]1st floor[US] with the mess; he instructs the player to come see him (his non-event NPC) on the 1st floor[UK]2nd floor[US] to assist in these matters.
