Item: Elf Tracker
Summary: The Elf Tracker, found east of Tyras Camp, is a member of the Iorwerth Clan, one of the eight Elven clans. He is a servant of the clan leader, Lord Iorwerth, and has been sent to scout out the area in and around King Tyras' old and dilapidated camp to determine where the humans fled. The tracker is featured numerous times during the Regicide quest. After talking to him, you can follow the footprints to the west of him, and these allow you to find the path that leads to the area containing Tyras Camp and Port Tyras, where the player must defeat a Tyras guard in order to access the camp.
