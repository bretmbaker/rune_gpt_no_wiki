Item: Gnormadium Avlafrim
Summary: Gnormadium Avlafrim is the gnome pilot in the Feldip Hills. Gnormadium is one of the gnomes that can transport a player via gnome glider. To use his glider you need to complete the quest One Small Favour. It is not enough to simply complete his part of the quest — which is all that is needed to access many things from many other quests — the whole quest must be completed before his location is usable.
