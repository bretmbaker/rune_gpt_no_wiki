Item: Malignius Mortifer
Summary: Malignius Mortifer is a necromancer just north-west of Port Sarim. He cannot be attacked, and has 4 apprentice wizards, one for each of the traditional elements: an air wizard, a water wizard, an earth wizard, and a fire wizard. All of these wizards are level 13. Mortifer will often try to raise the dead, but sometimes fails and creates fungus. Occasionally, he will summon a skeleton, skeleton mage, zombie or a ghost. They will follow Mortifer if the necromancy is successful. If a player annoys him by asking about his outfit, he will cast a spell, unblockable by the best Magical protection or even by the Protect from Magic prayer, to temporarily transform the player into a mushroom.
He is involved in the quests Swan Song and Fairytale I - Growing Pains. Mortifer calls himself a 'great practitioner' and a 'master' of the magic arts, he once triumphed over Tanglefoot, and is known to the Dark Wizard Zandar Horfyre. Mortifier also possesses knowledge of the Nature Spirit.
