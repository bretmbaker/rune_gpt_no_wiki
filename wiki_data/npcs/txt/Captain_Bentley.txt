Item: Captain Bentley
Summary: Captain Bentley is the captain of the Lady Zay. Players help him remove the jinx from his ship during Lunar Diplomacy. He likes the "non-judgemental" attitude of the Moonclan people, stating their willingness to trade with them despite his crew killing and plundering. However, he is oblivious of the Moonclan having made the Cabin boy place a jinx on his ship, albeit unintentionally, making the crew sail in circles.
