Item: Xolo
Summary: Xolos are dogs found in Civitas illa Fortis. Most can be interacted with, however the xolo in Outer Fortis near the cabbage patch can only be examined, which states Paw-tners in crime.. This dog does not wander, instead biting a piece of cabbage and hanging out with two other dogs, Lola and Molossus.
