Item: Oneiromancer
Summary: The Oneiromancer is the spiritual head of the Moon Clan, who resides on Lunar Isle, near the Astral Altar. Like the rest of her clan, she possesses adept control of magic past the reliance on runes.[1] As the head of the Moon Clan, she is in charge of the Waking Dream ceremony, in which a person enters their dreams so that they may become closer to magic and perform it at a level matching the Moon Clan.
