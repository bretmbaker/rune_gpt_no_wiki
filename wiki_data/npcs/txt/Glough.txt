Item: Glough
Summary: Glough (/ˈɡlʌf/ GLUFF)[1] is an ill-natured, misanthropic gnome who tries to take over Gielinor. In the Grand Tree quest, he can be found just south-east of the starting point of the Grand Tree; look for a ladder to the East of the ramp (between start of the quest and the agility course) that leads to Glough; take this ladder up to find Glough on the second floor.
