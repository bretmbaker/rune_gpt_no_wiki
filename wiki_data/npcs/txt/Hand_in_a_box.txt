Item: Hand in a box
Summary: Hand in a box was one of the five types of possessed toys found in the 2013 Halloween event. Shooting the hand in a box with a ghost buster 500 loaded with a white destabiliser would turn it into a green geist, which could then be dismissed by shooting it with a green destabiliser. After busting 3 of one type of geist, Diango would reward you with one piece of the skeleton outfit.
