Item: Rubber chicken (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The rubber chicken was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a rubber chicken. This was the first introduction of the rubber chicken in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Easter holiday events. The spawns were available for 1 week and dropped at the same time as the hats & scarves.
