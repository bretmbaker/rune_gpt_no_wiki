Item: Father Urhney
Summary: Father Urhney is an irritable priest who lives as a hermit in the Lumbridge Swamp. He has left Lumbridge to perform a full two-years meditation and retreat. Father Urhney never stops meditating, however, since he is constantly interrupted by people asking for amulets or claiming they have come to repossess his house. He suspects they are part of 'a bizarre conspiracy by some fiendish cult.'[1]
