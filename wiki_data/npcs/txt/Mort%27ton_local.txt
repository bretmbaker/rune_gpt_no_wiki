Item: Mort'ton local
Summary: Mort'ton locals are the result of using Serum 207 or Serum 208 on Afflicted in Mort'ton during or after the Shades of Mort'ton quest. As thanks for curing them of the Sanguinesti Affliction, they will reward you with some items, with Serum 208 providing slightly better rewards than Serum 207.
