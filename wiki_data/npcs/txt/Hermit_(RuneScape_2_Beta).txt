Item: Hermit (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: The hermit was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He would have appeared in the original version of Death Plateau. Presumably he would have been found in his cave leading towards the plateau. He would have told the player that a secret path up the plateau could be found in the sherpa's house.
