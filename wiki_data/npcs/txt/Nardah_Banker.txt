Item: Nardah Banker
Summary: Nardah bankers are men that run the Nardah bank in the southern part of Nardah. They are some of the only bankers in RuneScape who are named something other than simply "Banker," and they also look different from the standard banker model, wearing clothing in the same style as other Nardah citizens.
