Item: Ali the dyer
Summary: Ali the dyer is a woman on the north side of Pollnivneach who can make red, blue, and yellow dyes if players provide her with ingredients, similar to Aggie, the witch in Draynor Village. However, Ali is far less popular, as she is in an area not frequently visited by players due to distance between banks. She is found inside or just outside the most north-eastern house.
