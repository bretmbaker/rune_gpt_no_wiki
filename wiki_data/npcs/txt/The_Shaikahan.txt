Item: The Shaikahan
Summary: The Shaikahan is a lionlike creature that prowls the eastern jungle of Karamja (usually south of fairy ring DKP) and is involved in the Tai Bwo Wannai Trio quest, where the player must help Tamayu defeat it. According to Tamayu, it is very agile, and possesses extreme regenerative abilities, making it difficult to fight under normal circumstances.[1] He describes it standing as tall as a man, with fore claws sharp enough to rip through metal, and with glowing eyes that "burn the embers of death".[2] He also claims it to be 'a source of indescribable evil' and 'a beast more foul than your dreams could imagine' that hunts in the jungle for anyone 'foolish enough' to come across it.[3] Swan Song reveals that the Wise Old Man encountered and defeated it at some point in recent history.
