Item: Ancient Zygomite
Summary: Ancient Zygomites are stronger variants of mutated zygomites that require level 57 Slayer to harm. They are found exclusively on Fossil Island in the Mushroom Forest. Ancient zygomites cannot be killed unless a fungicide spray has been used to deliver the final blow. They first appear as non-attackable Ancient Fungi, which players must pick in order to provoke them out of the ground.
