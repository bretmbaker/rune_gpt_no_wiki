Item: Arzinian Being of Bordanzan
Summary: The Arzinian Being of Bordanzan is a powerful demonic creature from a realm known as Bordanzan that players encounter during the Between a Rock... quest. It can only be harmed if the player has at least six gold ore in their inventory (in which case it will be level 125), however his combat level will decrease to 75 if the player has at least 15 pieces of gold ore. (Note: Do not bring gold ores into the instance, as they will be removed from your inventory) If players bring fewer than six ores, it will appear blue (with no combat level) and instantly regenerate all its hitpoints every time the player attacks it.
