Item: Menaphite Leader
Summary: The Menaphite Leader is the head of a Menaphite gang exiled from Menaphos for trying to overthrow The Pharaoh. They have relocated to Pollnivneach as a base of operations and are in a feud with the local bandits over camel theft, although the leader considers them a mere nuisance to his plans to take over the world. He and his men are loyal followers of Amascut, the Devourer. Street urchins describe him as a 'deranged priest'.
