Item: Man (Hosidius)
Summary: The man occupying the small shack near the vinery in Hosidius is just one of Gielinor's many citizens. Unlike most other citizens though, the man can be found in an outhouse, one of the few toilets that exist in Gielinor. The fact that the man is currently using the toilet leads to some rather humorous conversation if the player opts to talk to him.
