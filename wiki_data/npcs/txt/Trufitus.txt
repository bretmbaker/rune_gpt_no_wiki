Item: Trufitus
Summary: Trufitus Shakaya is the shaman of Tai Bwo Wannai Village. He wishes to contact the "spirits of Karamja", possibly the Karamjan gods, and needs herbs to do so. During Jungle Potion, the player gathers these herbs for him. During Shilo Village, the adventurer brings to him scrolls and other artefacts to have them examined and be given advice on what to do next. He is in the eastern-most house north of Tai Bwo Wannai Village. He appears to be wearing beads of the dead. He seems to be an influential figure on Karamja.
