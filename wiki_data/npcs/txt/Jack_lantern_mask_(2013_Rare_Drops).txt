Item: Jack lantern mask (2013 Rare Drops)
Summary: The jack lantern mask was an item that spawned as part of the 2013 Rare Drops event. Picking up the spawn would provide the player with a jack lantern mask. The spawns were available for one week and dropped at the same time as the skeleton outfit. This was the first introduction of the jack lantern mask in Old School RuneScape, though it was later made available as part of the annual Halloween holiday events.
