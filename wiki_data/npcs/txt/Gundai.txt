Item: Gundai
Summary: Gundai is the banker for the Mage Arena in the Wilderness. The areas just north of the Mage Arena were very popular among player killers in the members' section of the Wilderness due to its close proximity to the bank and a rune store, thereby facilitating the replenishment of food, runes and other supplies.
