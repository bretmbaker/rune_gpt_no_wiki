Item: High Priest (Sophanem)
Summary: The High Priest of Icthlarin is the head priest of the Church of Icthlarin and can be found in the Great Temple in the west of the city of Sophanem. He is in charge of the city[1] as well as its religious leader; his duties involve the worship of the god of the dead as well as ensuring that the Devourer wields no power in Sophanem.[2] He is a friendlier man than was his predecessor as High Priest, the 'cruel and hard' Klenter, who 'could hold a grudge forever.'[3]
