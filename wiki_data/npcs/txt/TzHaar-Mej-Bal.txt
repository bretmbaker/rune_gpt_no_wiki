Item: TzHaar-Mej-Bal
Summary: TzHaar-Mej-Bal is an elder TzHaar mystic located in the western TzHaar terminal chamber in Mor Ul Rek. It, along with TzHaar-Mej-Dir, explains to players that as TzHaar grow older, they begin to solidify. To prolong their lives, they rest in the terminal chambers to draw heat from the volcano. Eventually, old TzHaar will solidify and turn into rock, known to the TzHaar as Haar-Tok. At this point, they are considered dead, as they are unable to move or communicate at all despite remaining conscious.
