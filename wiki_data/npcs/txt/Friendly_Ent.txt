Item: Friendly Ent
Summary: Friendly Ents are an unused NPC released alongside part two of Forestry. Based on its examine text, they presumably would have made an appearance as part of the Friendly Ent Forestry event alongside entlings, where they would spawn in place of a felled tree (similar to how a struggling sapling replaces a felled tree upon spawning).
