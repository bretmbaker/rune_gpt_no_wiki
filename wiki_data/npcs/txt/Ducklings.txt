Item: Ducklings
Summary: Ducklings are baby ducks found in bodies of water where other ducks can be found. They travel in groups of three, and usually follow the adult ducks around. Occasionally, the duck they are following will say Quack? and the ducklings will reply with Cheep Cheep! or Eep!. If the duck that the ducklings are following is killed, the ducklings will say Eek!.
