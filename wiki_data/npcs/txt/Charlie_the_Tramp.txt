Item: Charlie the Tramp
Summary: Charlie Lyeman the Tramp [1] (or Charles E. Trampin') is a tramp that tells the player about the Black Arm Gang headquarters during the Shield of Arrav quest. He is found right next to the southern entrance to Varrock, at the end of the alleyway to the Black Arm Gang's headquarters. If players choose to do so they may donate a coin or two to him.
