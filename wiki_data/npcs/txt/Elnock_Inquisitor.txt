Item: Elnock Inquisitor
Summary: Elnock Inquisitor is a gnome whom players need to speak to in order to start the Impetuous Impulses minigame. He will also supply players with a butterfly net and 7 empty impling jars to start them off. If players lose any of the original equipment he gave them, they may NOT reclaim it from him.
