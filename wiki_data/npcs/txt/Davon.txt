Item: Davon
Summary: Davon is a merchant found standing along the southern shore of Brimhaven towards the fence. He runs Davon's Amulet Store - apparently out of his pockets (in true underworld style), because he has neither a building nor a stall. The price of items is affected by wearing Karamja gloves.
