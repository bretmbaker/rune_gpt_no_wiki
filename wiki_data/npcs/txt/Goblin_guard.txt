Item: Goblin guard
Summary: The Goblin guard (known as Sleeping guard before being woken up) is a level 42 goblin with 43 hitpoints, who is guarding the kitchen gate in the dungeon near the Observatory. During the Observatory Quest players must "prod" him to wake him up, he then attacks the player while saying "Oi, how dare you wake me up!". He can be fought after the quest is complete as he respawns in the same place.
