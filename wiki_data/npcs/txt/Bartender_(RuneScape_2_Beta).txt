Item: Bartender (RuneScape 2 Beta)
Summary: The bartender was an unused non-player character present in the RuneScape 2 beta. He would have appeared in the original version of Death Plateau. Presumably he would have ran the local bar, and sold drinks to the player that could be used to beat the guard at dice and obtain the combination scroll.
