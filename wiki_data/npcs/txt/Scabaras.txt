Item: Scabaras
Summary: Scabaras (Jagex pronunciation: scab-uh-riss) is the god of isolation and one of the four minor gods of the Menaphite Pantheon, a collection of deities that rule over the Kharidian Desert. His followers are known as Scabarites. According to a legend from the Book of Light and Day, he was created from the last of the four dreams that the main god Tumeken once had over four days. The dream resulted in Scabaras's creation, Tumeken's avatar of isolation.
