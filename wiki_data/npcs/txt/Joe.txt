Item: Joe
Summary: Harpoon Joe (called Joe in-game) is a barman who sells wine, 'rum', beer and stew in his pub, Harpoon Joe's House of 'Rum'. on Mos Le'Harmless. He is not very welcoming to patrons who do not wish to purchase anything from him, and asks them to "Stop takin' up me floor space". Players need to have a book o' piracy when trying to trade with him, otherwise he will respond with unintelligible pirate slang.
