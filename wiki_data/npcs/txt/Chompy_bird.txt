Item: Chompy bird
Summary: Chompy birds are part of the chompy bird hunting activity. They can only be killed after completing the Big Chompy Bird Hunting quest. Killing them requires a comp ogre bow or ogre bow with brutal arrows or ogre arrows. They cannot be killed with melee or Magic. Bloated toads must be used as bait to lure them to the area. Bloated toads are made by using ogre bellows filled with swamp gas on nearby toads at the swamp. Chompy birds spawn in a 10 tile radius around the bloated toad (21x21 square). A chompy bird will leave if it is not killed after one minute.
