Item: Jade (Warriors' Guild)
Summary: Jade is the only banker in the Warriors' Guild. She manages the whole banking system in the guild, keeping only one booth open for banking. She isn't wearing the typical bankers uniform like most of the bankers in Gielinor do, instead, she is wearing her own clothes. She can be found on the bottom floor, next to the Animation room. When asked how long she has been working at the Warriors' Guild she responds that she's been working ever since the Guild opened. She claims that she likes it there because the warriors reduce the chance of her bank being robbed.
