Item: Mazchna
Summary: Mazchna (/ˈmæʃnə/ mash-ner[1]) is the second-to-lowest level Slayer Master, giving tasks to players with a Combat level of 20 and above. He is located in north-eastern Canifis, and therefore completion of the Priest in Peril quest is required to access him. Mazchna is notable for giving Slayer tasks close to his area. His tasks are relatively easy and ideal for players with lower combat levels.
