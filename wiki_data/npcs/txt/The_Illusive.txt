Item: The Illusive
Summary: The Illusive is the fourth and final boss fought in the quest Dream Mentor. Unlike the previous forms, it is much weaker in combat stats. It is similar in mechanics to the Giant Mole as it digs away during combat; fighting it requires patience, as players can only hit it once or twice before it digs and resurfaces elsewhere. It is most weak to Magic, so players should use trident of the seas or Iban Blast in order to kill it effectively. Using Magic is also beneficial because the player can attack it from a distance as it digs around.
