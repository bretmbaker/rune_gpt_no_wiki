Item: Co-ordinator
Summary: The Co-ordinator is a fairy located in Zanaris who controls the weather of RuneScape, and is one of the focuses of Fairytale II - Cure a Queen. She teaches you how to use the fairy rings after talking to the Fairy Godfather. She hovers just north of the room Chaeldar is in, and south of the Evil Chicken's Lair. A quite perfunctory history is given to the player, and she seems to hate every moment spent talking with the player.
