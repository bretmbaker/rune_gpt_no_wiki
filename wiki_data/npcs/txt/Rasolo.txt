Item: Rasolo
Summary: Rasolo is a wandering merchant found west of the Fishing Guild and south of the Baxtorian Falls. He sells items that can otherwise be found in various locations around RuneScape, but at twice their normal price. He will also buy any tradeable items, just like a General store, but at heavily reduced prices.
