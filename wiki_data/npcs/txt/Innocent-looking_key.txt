Item: Innocent-looking key
Summary: The Innocent-looking key is a key encountered during the Haunted Mine quest. When the player first tries to take it, the key floats away and the ghost Treus Dayth appears. After the ghost is defeated, the key can be taken to give the player a Crystal-mine key. This allows further access into the mine, where crystal can be mined to make a Salve amulet.
