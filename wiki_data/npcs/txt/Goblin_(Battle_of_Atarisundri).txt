Item: Goblin (Battle of Atarisundri)
Summary: Goblins appear during the cutscene showing Hazelmere's memory of the Battle of Atarisundri in The Eyes of Glouphrie quest. Alongside the Goblin crowds, they are members of the Garagorshuun and Thorobshuun tribes at war with King Healthorg's gnomes for control of Kandarin. They are ultimately run away after being scared off by Glouphrie the Untrusted's illusory tortoises.
