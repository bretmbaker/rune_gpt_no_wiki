Item: Worker (Sophanem)
Summary: Workers are NPCs that dwell in Sophanem. They, as the other citizens, suffer from the plague, but due to The Pharaoh's quarantine of the city, trapped Sophanites that went to, for example, buy goods on the Menaphite market have been trapped in Menaphos, which means that the workers have no work. After the quarantine is lifted during Contact, however, the workers must work hard once again and "shoot you a murderous look".
