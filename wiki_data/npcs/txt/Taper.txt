Item: Taper
Summary: The Taper was an entity that previously appeared during the Candlelight random event. When Pious Pete asked the player to relight the candles in his church, the Taper would appear in the interface for lighting the candles. It was removed from the game with the rest of the event in a hidden update sometime after June 2006, and as a result has never been present in Old School RuneScape.
