Item: Het
Summary: Het is the desert god of health, both physical and mental, and is one of the four minor gods of the Menaphite Pantheon. According to a legend from the Book of Light and Day, he was created from one of the four dreams that the main god Tumeken once had over four days. He has the head of a human, unlike the rest of the Pantheon, whose members sport animal heads.
