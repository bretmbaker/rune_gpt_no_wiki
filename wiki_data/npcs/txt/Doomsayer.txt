Item: Doomsayer
Summary: The Doomsayer is found wandering around Lumbridge near the Lumbridge Guide prophesying doom to all who speak to him. He has a natural skill at sensing danger, and he feels it is his duty to warn others of the potential hazards that await unsuspecting travellers. He does this by putting up warning signs in dangerous places, accompanied by a warning message. Whilst he calls himself the Doomsayer, he feels that his proper title is Danger Tutor.
