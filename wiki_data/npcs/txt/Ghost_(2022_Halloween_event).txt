Item: Ghost (2022 Halloween event)
Summary: Ghosts were NPCs encountered during the 2022 Halloween event. When using the trick or treat option on an NPC during the event this ghost may appear. Upon talking to it with a ghostspeak amulet equipped you feel a "ghostly presence" around you and your next "trick or treating" will always result in you receiving treats. This only lasts for one use.
