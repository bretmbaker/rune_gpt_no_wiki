Item: Cave goblin (train station)
Summary: Many cave goblins wander around the Dorgesh-Kaanâ€“Keldagrim train system in both Dorgesh-Kaan and Keldagrim. When spoken to, they will either talk about how much they enjoyed Keldagrim, or express gratitude to your character for saving Zanik and creating the train system.
