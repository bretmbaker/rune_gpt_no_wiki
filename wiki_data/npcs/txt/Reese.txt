Item: Reese
Summary: Reese is a citizen of Prifddinas, and an expert on crystal singing. She can be found near the singing bowl on the south-east side of the city, near Gwyn's Mining Emporium. She will offer to sing crystal items into being for the player, at the cost of some crystal shards. Asking Reese to sing on the player's behalf will unlock a convenient Sing menu option for both her and Conwenna.
