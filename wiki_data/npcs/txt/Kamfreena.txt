Item: Kamfreena
Summary: Kamfreena can be found at the top floor of the Warriors' Guild. If you have more than 100 warrior guild tokens, she will let you enter a room filled with Cyclopes, which have a rare chance to drop Defenders of various kinds up to the rune defender. In order to obtain a dragon defender, Kamfreena will advise you to go to the basement of the Warrior's Guild (proceed north-west of the Warrior's Guild bank past Lidio's food shop, out the back door west of the Warrior's Guild and climb down the ladder) and speak to Lorelai, who is Kamfreena's apprentice. Staying in the top floor Cyclopes room costs 10 tokens for every minute in the room. Kamfreena will take 10 tokens from you upon first entering the room and you can stay 1 extra minute after you have run out of tokens. Kamfreena wields both a steel 2h sword and a defender at the same time.
