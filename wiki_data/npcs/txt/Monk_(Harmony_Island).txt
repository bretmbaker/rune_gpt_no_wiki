Item: Monk (Harmony Island)
Summary: The monks are members of the order on Harmony Island. They were assaulted by Mi-Gor and his crew of zombie pirates and sorebones, who swapped their brains with zombies. The zombified monks managed to escape and barricade themselves inside the windmill with their original bodies kept in the cellar. During The Great Brain Robbery the player, with some help from Dr Fenkenstrain, foiled Mi-Gor's plans and assisted the monks to return their brains to their proper bodies. The island is however still overrun by zombies, so the monks remain in the windmill for now.
