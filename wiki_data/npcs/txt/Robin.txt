Item: Robin
Summary: Robin Hood is a famous archer and one of the few living humans in Port Phasmatys, where he can be found in The Green Ghost. Robin used to be the leader of a large gang, but they eventually left him under leadership of Dirk Turnip, since Robin forced them to live in the woods and wear ridiculous outfits. The gang became a group of highwaymen and were dissatisfied with Dirk's callousness, but they decided to stick with him, anything being better than Robin.
