Item: Wizard Frumscone
Summary: Wizard Frumscone is a necromancer found in the basement of the Wizards' Guild, where he summons magical zombies. He is involved in the Swan Song quest, but does not play much of a role, as he sends you to speak to Malignius Mortifer instead. He wears robes similar to wizard robes.
