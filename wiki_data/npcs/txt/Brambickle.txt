Item: Brambickle
Summary: Brambickle is a gnomish explorer located atop the Trollweiss Mountain. He may ask for a hard order in the Gnome Restaurant minigame. To get to Brambickle you do not need to have completed Troll Romance. Many players find it tedious to deliver to him, so most usually refuse to take the order, and wait five minutes for another one.
