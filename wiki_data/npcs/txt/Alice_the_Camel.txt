Item: Alice the Camel
Summary: Alice the Camel is a bactrian camel from Al Kharid. She is located to the east of Ellis's tannery. Players can insult her by saying "I wonder if that camel has fleas...", "Mmm... looks like that camel would make a nice kebab", or "If I go near that camel, it'll probably bite my hand off." She will respond by glaring at you, spitting at you or trying to stamp on your foot. She appears as a generic camel before Rogue Trader is complete.
