Item: Jubbly bird
Summary: A jubbly is a bird found during the Skrach Uglologwee subquest of the Recipe for Disaster quest. They appear to be a big, purplish version of a normal Chompy. They can be hunted and killed by using ogre bellows on an already bloated toad with a rock from one of the mineable rocks in the area and a ball of wool. Combining the wool and the toad creates a balloon toad which is used as bait.
