Item: Ahrim the Blighted
Summary: Ahrim the Blighted is the oldest of the Barrows brothers and uses the Magic corner of the combat triangle. His crypt is found in the centre of the Barrows. He wears robes, which make him vulnerable to Ranged as well as Melee attacks. Ahrim can easily damage the player with his magical attacks, as they are very accurate even on dragonhide armour. Aside from this, Ahrim can also use Confuse, Weaken and Curse on the player, lowering their Attack, Strength and Defence stats respectively. Ahrim's set effect is Blighted Aura, which gives him a 20% chance to lower the player's Strength stat by 5 for each successful hit.
