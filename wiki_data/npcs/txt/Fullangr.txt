Item: Fullangr
Summary: Fullangr is a dwarf working in the caves beneath Miscellania. He is part of a team of dwarves working to expand the caves to provide additional housing for Miscellanians. Because the dig must be done carefully, only two of them can work at a time. He waits for his shift in a small house near The Esoterican Arms bar.
