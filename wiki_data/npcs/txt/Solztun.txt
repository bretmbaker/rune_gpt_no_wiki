Item: Solztun
Summary: Solztun is a deceased adventurer, whose spirit can be found at the end of the Stronghold of Security's bottom level. He is the brother of Litara, who is found outside the entrance of the stronghold. Players do not require an amulet of ghostspeak when speaking to him, as he can communicate telepathically.[1]
