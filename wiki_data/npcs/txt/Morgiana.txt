Item: Morgiana
Summary: Morgiana is a retired knight found in the Uzer Oasis within the Kharidian Desert. She is a former knight of Saradomin, descending from a long line of Saradominist warriors, many of whom died in battle. After retiring, she moved to the Uzer Oasis in the hopes of finding a more peaceful life. Despite the desert heat, she wears armour and weapons, heirlooms from her ancestors, to deter any bandits who may pass through the area.
