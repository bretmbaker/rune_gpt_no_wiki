Item: Goblin (Observatory Dungeon)
Summary: Two lost goblins can be found aimlessly roaming the corridors of the Observatory Dungeon, all the while muttering about their inability to find a way out of the maze. While bearing a great visual likeness to regular goblins, neither of the two can be attacked, nor interacted with in any other way.
