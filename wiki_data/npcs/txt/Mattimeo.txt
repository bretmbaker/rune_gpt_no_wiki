Item: Mattimeo
Summary: Mattimeo is a bird watcher who can be found just north of the Museum Camp on Fossil Island, looking at all the new exotic birds which inhabit the island. He inadvertenly gives the player the idea to capture birds using bird house traps filled with herb or hop seeds. He is the son of Matthias, the falconer in the Piscatoris Hunter area.
