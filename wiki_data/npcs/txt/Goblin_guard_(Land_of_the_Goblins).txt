Item: Goblin guard (Land of the Goblins)
Summary: Two goblin guards guard the stairs leading to the secret Goblin Temple in the Goblin Cave during the Land of the Goblins quest. They prevent humans from entering the temple, meaning a goblin potion must be used. They may be spoken to after the quest to change the player's goblin name.
