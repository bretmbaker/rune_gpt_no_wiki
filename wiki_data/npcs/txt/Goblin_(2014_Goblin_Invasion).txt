Item: Goblin (2014 Goblin Invasion)
Summary: Goblins were involved in the second and third stages of the 2014 Goblin Invasion. During the second stage, large numbers of goblins and guards could be found in and around Falador, with options to paint and 360NoScope-paint. Players could side with either the guard or goblin factions by talking to the Guard Recruiter or Goblin Recruiter to obtain an event rpg, then use it to paint the enemies of the opposing side. When fighting for the guards, painting a goblin would turn it into a painted goblin, which could be killed for drops and would increase the score of the guard faction by 1. The goblins were removed with the end of the goblin invasion event.
