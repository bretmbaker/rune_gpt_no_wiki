Item: Wemund
Summary: Wemund is a dwarf that runs a small shop in western Keldagrim. His store is named Wemund's Wrench Warehouse and specialises in wrenches. He also stocks other goods that relate to the dwarves' steam engine technology, such as pipes and boilers. He seems to smith many of the items himself, as suggested by the anvil found within his shop. He has only one other employee, a Dwarven Engineer that was recently forced to retire due to a mining accident.
