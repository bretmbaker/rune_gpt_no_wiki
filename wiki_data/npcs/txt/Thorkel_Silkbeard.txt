Item: Thorkel Silkbeard
Summary: Thorkel Silkbeard is the current advisor of King Gjuki Sorvott IV, the ruler of the island-kingdom Jatizso, which is at war with the neighbouring town of Neitiznot. Thorkel Silkbeard is an NPC in the quest The Fremennik Isles, in which the player must aid both Jatizso and Neitiznot, initially on the side of King Gjuki, but later switching over to the employ of Mawnis Burowgar, the Burgher of Neitiznot. Thorkel is spoken to when the player is on the side of Gjuki Sorvott, and explains in greater detail about the window tax that the King calls for to increase Jatizso's wealth.
