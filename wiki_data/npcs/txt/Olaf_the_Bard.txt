Item: Olaf the Bard
Summary: Olaf the Bard is a travelling bard and member of the Fremennik Council of Elders. His vote is required for the completion of The Fremennik Trials. The player is required to make a Lyre from the branch of a Swaying tree and string it using Golden fleece. The bard then tells the player to play in the Rellekka Longhall Bar. After doing so, he will pledge his vote and teach the player how to turn the lyre into an Enchanted lyre. He can be found wandering just east of the long hall.
