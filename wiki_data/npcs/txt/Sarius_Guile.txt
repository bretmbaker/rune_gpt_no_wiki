Item: Sarius Guile
Summary: Sarius Guile is a servant of Vanescula Drakan and is first seen during the Darkness of Hallowvale quest. She lives in a house on the east side of Meiyerditch, although she is never home. Instead, she is likely in or around Castle Drakan, working. She is humbly dressed, but her status as servant of a Drakan still makes her exude something of importance, unlike the frail Meiyerditch citizens. She is still extremely lean, however, which may mean Sarius has to pay blood tithes as well.
