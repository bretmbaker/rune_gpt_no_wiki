Item: Gnome (Mourner Headquarters)
Summary: The Gnome (real name unknown) is a character, who is being tortured on a rack by the Mourners in Mourner Headquarters in West Ardougne. He is involved in Mourning's End Part I, where it is revealed that he can fix a device needed to re-dye some sick-looking sheep. The player will threaten to take out his wisdom teeth, which he replies that gnomes do not have any wisdom. By using a feather on him to tickle his feet and bribing him with toad crunchies, he will ask the player for a piece of soft leather and a magic log to repair it.
