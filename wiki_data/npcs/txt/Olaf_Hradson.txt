Item: Olaf Hradson
Summary: Olaf Hradson, also known as Olaf the Illiterate, is a Fremennik who wants to be a treasure hunter. He set sail across the sea using a map that had been given to him many years ago, but because he set sail during a storm, his boat was wrecked and he washed back up on shore. This experience left him afraid and he decided against his aspirations of finding hidden riches. However, he does not want his family to know that he has failed and bring shame to them, so he asks the player to help him, and fake his success to his wife, Ingrid Hradson and son, Volf Olafson.
