Item: Terrorchick gnome
Summary: Terrorchick gnomes[sic] are young terrorbirds that can be found in a pen around the Grand Tree in the Tree Gnome Stronghold. Unlike adult terrorbirds, terrorchicks are used for non-military riding, particularly the delivering of food. Although their name suggests a gnome is riding them, they appear to be only carrying supplies.
