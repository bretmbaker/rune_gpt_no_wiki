Item: Sharathteerk
Summary: Sharathteerk is a gargoyle and second-in-command to the Mahjarrat warlord Zemouregal. He appears alongside Zemouregal in both Defender of Varrock and The Curse of Arrav. Unlike most gargoyles, Sharathteerk is capable of speaking and exhibits a fair amount of intelligence, as shown by him attempting to warn Zemouregal about Lucien's recent surge in power.[1] Despite this, Zemouregal treats Sharathteerk somewhat poorly, having no regard for his safety.[2]
