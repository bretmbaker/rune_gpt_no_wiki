Item: Penwie
Summary: Penwie can be found south-west of the Gnome glider among the Jogres on Karamja. He can also be found near the tribesmen directly west of the Gnome glider. Penwie is difficult to see because the clothes he wears blend in with his surroundings. He is involved in the Gnome restaurant minigame as a hard order. Penwie has a chance of giving the unique reward of a raw oomlie, but does not award the special rewards of a gnome scarf or gnome goggles.
