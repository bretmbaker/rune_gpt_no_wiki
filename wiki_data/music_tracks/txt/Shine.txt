Map



Shineis amusictrack that is unlocked north of theEmir's Arenafacilities, around theMage Training Arena. In Classic music mode, it plays in a wider area including Emir's Arena hospital, bank and western side of cliffs west from Mage Training Arena.

Analysis[edit|edit source]

The music track begins with a strong and short-noted beat that is repeated during most of the song. Strings and percussion are added while maintaining a high-pitched melody. A piano plays the song's main tune at a high-pitched note. The tempo remains at a medium-fast beat throughout the tune. Synthesizers are included before the beat is changed. The bridge includes one of the signature tunes played in many of the desert songs and a slower, but still up-beat tune with a synthesizer and other instruments, before again returning to the main tune of the track a final time. At the very end, a crowd and several dongs can be heard.
