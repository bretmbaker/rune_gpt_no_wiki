Scape Groundis amusictrack that all new players automatically unlock. It was originally released along with theFarmingskilland it was played on the log-in screen during the first week of the skill's release. It is one of five music tracks which was created to commemorate the release of certain skills.

The song is an adaptation of what was, at the time, theRuneScapemain theme, now known asScape Original. As a result, it sounds similar not only to Scape Original, but a variety of other theme adaptations such asScape SantaandScape Main.
