Trivia[edit|edit source]

According to datacrowdsourcedvia RuneLite, approximately 88% of players unlock the track at the King Black Dragon Lair, while 12% unlock it during Dragon Slayer II.The track could originally be unlocked in theTemple of Ikov, next to the first King Black Dragon Lair, and can currently be unlocked there inRuneScape. This led many including Mod Ash to falsely assume it could be unlocked here inOld School RuneScape.[1]In fact, the track was removed from here in a hidden update prior to 2007, and was not readded until February 2008.
