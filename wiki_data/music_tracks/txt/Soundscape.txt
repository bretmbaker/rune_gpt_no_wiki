Analysis[edit|edit source]

This track begins with a synthesised background tune and various strings. The beat is slowly built up with more instruments added including horns, and more strings. The tempo remains the same for most of the song at a constant beat with different instruments being added each time. The song has an uplifting and adventurous melody with high-pitched strings and long notes, without the speed being significantly slow.
