Trivia[edit|edit source]

'Bane' is a variation of the RuneScape track 'Bane of Summer' from the 29th of July, in 2008. There is a slight difference between the Old School RuneScape Version of this song and the actual one released in 2008, due to the different quality in soundbanks, or instruments used.
