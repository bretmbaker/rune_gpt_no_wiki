Country Jigis amusictrack unlocked south ofHosidius, at theVinery, its basement andTithe Farm.

Analysis[edit|edit source]

This track is in the key of G Major, and has a constant tempo of 120. It is very upbeat and happy, with a somewhat catchy and repetitive melody. The Banjo instrument was rarely used within the musical compositions ofOld School RuneScape. The same goes with the Honky-Tonk Piano, as it wasn't really used until the Honky-Tonk variations of classicRuneScapesongs inRuneScape 3.
