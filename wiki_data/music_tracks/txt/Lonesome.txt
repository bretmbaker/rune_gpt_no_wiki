Trivia[edit|edit source]

This track appears to contain a refrain which sounds very similar (if not identical) to the four main notes of theSong of the Volga Boatmen, a traditional Russian folk song. This could be appropriate, given that the song is associated with hard labour, and Lonesome is unlocked in a mining camp.
