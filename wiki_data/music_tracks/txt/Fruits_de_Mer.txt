Despite being unlockable onCrandorbefore2021, the track wasmembers-onlydue to the westernmost tiles of Crandor (where it played) being impassable infree-to-playservers. However, even after removal of Fruits de Mer from Crandor, these tiles still remain members-only."Fruits de Mer" is the French term for seafood, literally translating to "Fruits of the Sea".According to datacrowdsourcedvia RuneLite in2020, approximately 99.96% of players unlocked the track on the Fishing Platform, while 0.04% unlocked it on Crandor.
