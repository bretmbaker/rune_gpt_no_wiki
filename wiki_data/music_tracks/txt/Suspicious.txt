Trivia[edit|edit source]

The track sounds very similar toDeep Down.There used to be a glitch duringMonkey Madness Iwhereby players would be teleported into the cutscenes, and could only progress by manually talking to the NPCs involved.[1]When this occurred default music would play instead of Suspicious.
