Analysis[edit|edit source]

This song is in the key of D minor with many Dorian modal inflections. The tempo is 96 beats per minute, and although in 4/4 time, most of the track uses the non-standard metrical subdivision 3+3+3+3+2+2. Extensive use of interrupted cadential harmony (V-VI) can be heard throughout, particularly in the transition to the B section at 0:38, where there is a surprising shift to major. Here an arpeggiated harp figuration is heard, which embodies the aspirational nature of the Inferno, before giving way to an unwieldy melody in parallel minor thirds making use of tonally distant chords.

In terms of scoring, the track makes use of brass instruments such as the French Horn (GM Instrument 60) & Brass Ensemble (GM Instrument 61), performing heavy-sounding crescendos at various times. Adam Bond typically utilises brassy crescendos in his battle-like compositions (Including reworks), mostly in the mainRuneScapegame, hence why finding this inOld School RuneScapeis a rare occurrence.

One of the earliest examples of this would be in the trackFe Fi Fo Fum, a song from the 4th of June, in 2007. Besides the brass in this composition, it also consists of Strings (GM Instrument 48) accompanied by an Acoustic Grand Piano (GM Instrument 0) which can be heard slightly in the background. This song also makes use of a Square Wave (GM Instrument 80), which is rarely used inOld School RuneScape. The Square Wave instrument is most likely an imitation of the effects used in Bond's previous Lava Falls composition.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

This track bears resemblance to the songAt Doom's Gatefrom the video gameDoom.This track is in the same key asMor Ul Rek, another Adam Bond composition, which plays just outside the Inferno.It is also very similar to another Adam Bond composition from the mainRuneScapegame,Lava Falls. Despite Inferno being similar to Lava Falls, the song has been transposed to another key and rearranged/recomposed.This track is later remixed in the mainRuneScapegame asThe Glory of Combat.
