Trivia[edit|edit source]

While most music tracks are unlocked automatically by simply moving through an area, this track used to only play manually upon entering the Museum doors. It was coded to stop playing and be replaced byGardenorMedievalwhen the player left the museum. However this resulted in a bug whereby teleporting out of the museum would cause one of these tracks to play at the teleport destination instead of the default track. This bug has been fixed during anupdatein2021.
