Analysis[edit|edit source]

It is very calm and pleasant sounding for a wilderness track. Inspiration's soft and mysterious melodies remind players that the Wilderness is a place of wonder and surprise, not only death and destruction.

Inspiration is written in a 4/4 time signature. It is comprised of series of brief eight measure "sections" that are driven by the song's characteristic piano chords.

The track starts out with seven mysterious whole note piano chords (string chords in the older version). The piano then begins a series of slow ascending eighth notes while repeating the previous chords in synchronization. Afterwards, the piano pauses briefly while a harpsicord picks up the eighth notes one more time and ends the statement with a half note concert A.

The piano then begins a series of half note chords while a flute enters with a series of difficult descending thirty-second note runs. After seven measures of two chords each, the piano drops away again, leaving the flute trapped in a group of stacatto eighth notes for one more measure to complete the section.

The piano begins a new group of whole note chords, while stuck in a series of ascending and descending eighth note octaves. After each octave the harpsicord jumps in with a brief two-note statement. The flute repeats its difficult runs from the previous section. After seven measures, the section ends similarly to the last one, although the harpsicord seems to lose its composure a bit in the sixth measure and finishes with alternating sixteenth notes in the eighth measure.
