Analysis[edit|edit source]

This song contains a pleasant piano solo and horn solo with snare rhythm. It begins with a lone acoustic guitar playing an arpeggiated chord progression, featuring mostly minor chords, which result in a dark, mysterious mood. This progression (beginning with E minor and ending with E major) forms the basis of the song, and after two bars more instruments are added: violin, the drum and high pitched synthesizer tones, and then a horn part. The song is at a medium to slow tempo with a serene melody.
