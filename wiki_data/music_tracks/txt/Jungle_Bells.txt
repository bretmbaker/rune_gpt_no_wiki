Analysis[edit|edit source]

The song plays at a relatively moderate tempo, with a very low pitched beat resonating in the background. The bell sounds seem somewhat discordant, as to entail the general mis-happenings that tend to occur around Christmas events. It keeps in theme with RuneScape-styled jungle tunes. The melody is essentially "Jingle Bells" played in a minor key.
