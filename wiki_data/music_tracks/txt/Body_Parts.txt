Analysis[edit|edit source]

It seems to start with a drum kit playing a syncopated line, then a Baritone Saxophone or Trombone plays a basic jazz rhythm on the drum beat. Later an organ begins to play and plays the chromatic runs more typical of RuneScape Music tracks, while a Marimba plays a background countermelody, with the Baritone Sax or Trombone continuing to play the bass line much more softly.
