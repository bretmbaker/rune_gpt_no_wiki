Analysis[edit|edit source]

The opening tune is played by harp and synthesizers are introduced. The harp's tune is slightly more upbeat than the synthesizers although most of the instruments stay at a high pitch. At a different part a piano will play a melody before returning to the harp and violins, slowly fading out and finishing.
