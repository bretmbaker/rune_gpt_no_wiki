Analysis[edit|edit source]

It is steady, happy jazz track that opens with a few soft drum noises and quickly segues into the theme. The track features many dwarven sound effects and intricate synthesizer. It features a powerful middle section, with fairly heavy brass and heavier drums, and this segues back into the main melody for a final verse and chorus before ending slowly with the soft drum effects similar to those in the opening.
