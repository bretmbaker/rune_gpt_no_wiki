Trivia[edit|edit source]

Until anupdateon28 April2021, while most music tracks are unlocked by simply walking into a specific area, this track manually played upon opening the maze door. It was coded to stop playing and be replaced byEmperorwhen the player left the maze. However, this resulted in a bug whereby teleporting out of the maze would cause Emperor to play at the teleport destination instead of the default track.
