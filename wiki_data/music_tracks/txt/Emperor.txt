Analysis[edit|edit source]

The song is very slow and simple. It has some low strings, including what sounds like a sitar, a choir in the background, and what sounds like a trumpet or cornet.

When the track arrives at the bridge, the instrumentation changes dramatically, with a guitar playing waltz triplets, violins playing a counter-melody, and woodwinds having a melody. It briefly goes back to the beginning melody, but quickly switches to an almost operatic strings and choir part, with a piano playing the melody.

The trumpet joins back in, and plays the ending melody, before fading out to the sound of the piano.
