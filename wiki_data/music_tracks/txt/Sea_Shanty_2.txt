Sea Shanty 2is amusictrack that is unlocked inPort Sarim. It can also be unlocked by going to the docks west ofPrifddinasor onTempoross Coveafter defeatingTempoross.

The track has become arguably one of the most iconic tracks inOld School RuneScape;Ian Taylor, the track's composer, would later comment on its fame in an interview in late 2018:

“ | The 60kB limit was still in place when I wrote "Sea Shanty 2", so it was a simple tune like all those early tracks — again, I was going for catchy. It came very quickly to me once I was in the shanty-writing groove. It has remained in the game for well over a decade, and has always enjoyed a degree of notoriety because it's a cheesy earworm. Since Old School RuneScape launched in 2013, we came to realise that the fanbase had re-embraced the track, and it has become a meme. There are plenty of silly videos featuring it, Rick-Rolling, etc. Although it makes me cringe a little, I don't mind it being a humorous song as it has charm. One of my ambitions in life is to write a novelty track and retire from the proceeds. "Sea Shanty 2" might be my best effort yet, but sadly I'm not close to retiring...[1] | ”
