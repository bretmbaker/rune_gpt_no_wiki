Analysis[edit|edit source]

Rest in Peacestarts off as a subdued funerary march, with a plucked bass playing a somber accompaniment in a simple duple meter. Soon the melody enters in the form of a nylon string guitar playing a set of variations around a descending tetrachord in A minor – a musical form typical for a lament.

The following section provides a moment of intense contrast as the string ensemble enters in an agitated tempo, which the melody answers with an anguished phrase. This overtly tormented expression briskly fades away, and the initial subdued melody returns.

According to Bridges, the sorrowful mood of the music piece reflects the days he spent at his father's deathbed, who passed away some years prior to its composition.[1]
