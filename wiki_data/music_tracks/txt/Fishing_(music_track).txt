Analysis[edit|edit source]

It focuses on a slow and steady piano melody that continues throughout the song, and also uses a guitar, flutes and organ. A unique feature is the sound of washing waves that plays in the beginning of the song, which fittingly makes the song mimic the sound of a calm beachside.
