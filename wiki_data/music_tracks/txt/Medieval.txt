Analysis[edit|edit source]

This track uses a harpsichord playing waltz triplets in a slow, droning manner. The flute and oboe quickly come in and share a melodic part, and are then replaced briefly by a harp. It is somewhat of a slow, walking-tempo song. Also, the keyboard is slightly used in parts of the song as well as slight notions of guitar strums.
