Trivia[edit|edit source]

Prior to anupdateon27 April2022, although the track was most likely not supposed to be unlockable in the Desert, players could do so by running overa specific tilealong a north-west to south-east diagonal. According to datacrowdsourcedvia RuneLite in2020, approximately 0.5% of players unlocked the track in this way, as opposed to 99.5% who unlocked it near Burgh de Rott.This track is a reference to the instrumental track "Laura Palmer's Theme" from thesoundtrackof theTwin Peakstelevision show. The tracks start with identical chords and melodies, while the rest is extremely similar. Both tracks relate to the themes of mystery and desolation that surround both the plot of the series andBurgh de Rott's history.
