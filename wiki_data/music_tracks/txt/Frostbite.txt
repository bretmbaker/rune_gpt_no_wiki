Analysis[edit|edit source]

The main melody of this song starts on the harp; drums and slow strings make up the rhythm. Shortly into the song, bells take over for the melody temporarily before returning it to the harp; the bells continue playing as harmony. Near the middle of the piece, the mood temporarily changes from its original slow, soft feel to an eerie unresolved section.
