"Just keep swimming...swimming...swimming" is a reference to Dory fromFinding Nemo.Using any item on the fishbowl will yield the message "Your fish looks at you strangely. You get the feeling this will not work." Interestingly, using the fishbowl on any other item instead returns "Nothing interesting happens."Fish can be put in themenagerieof aplayer-owned house.
