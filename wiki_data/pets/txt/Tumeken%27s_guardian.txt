[Pet: Tumeken%27s_guardian]

Tumeken's Guardianis apetthat can be obtained from completing theTombs of Amascut. It is a much smaller version ofTumeken's Warden. Players have a chance of receiving the pet when looting thereward chestin the burial chamber. It is possible for it to be obtained in Entry mode, although at a much lower rate.

When a player receives the pet, it will automatically try to appear as their follower. At the same time, a message in thechatboxwill stateYou have a funny feeling like you're being followed.However, if a player receives a pet while having a follower out (for example, acat), it will be placed into theirinventory. When this occurs, the message in the chatbox will instead stateYou feel something weird sneaking into your backpack.

If a player's inventory is fullandthey have a follower already, theywill notreceive the pet; it must instead be claimed fromProbitainEast Ardougnefor a reclaim token, which costs 1,000,000coins.

Ondeath, if a player loses their pet (as a follower or in your inventory) it will wander around the area for 30 seconds before despawning. Even if the player returns in time, the pet cannot be picked up, and can be reclaimed from Probita for a reclaim token.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The damaged guardians' dialogue is a reference to various errors in software. 404 being a reference to error message:HTTP 404.The name Akkhito may be a reference toAkihito, the Emperor Emeritus of Japan. In Spanish the suffix-itois a diminutive that can be added to many nouns and adjectives to create a smaller or more affectionate form (Small Akkha).The name Kephriti may be a reference toNefertiti, an ancient Egyptian queen, particularly known for an iconic and well-preservedbustportraying her.When a player uses raw beef or raw chicken on Zebo, special dialogue will occur between the pet and the player referencing the "On a diet" invocation.Dropping Babi from the inventory then changing to a different metamorphosis variant will cause the chosen variant to inherit Babi's run speed. The same can be done in reverse to make Babi walk.
