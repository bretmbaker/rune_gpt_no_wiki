[Pet: Beaver]

Thebeaveris a members-only skillingpetthat can be obtained while trainingWoodcutting. A strange sound is heard when you obtain the beaver while Woodcutting. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Woodcutting level, and the time it takes to gather a resource.

When a player receives the pet, it will automatically try to appear as their follower. At the same time, a message in thechatboxwill stateYou have a funny feeling like you're being followed.However, if a player receives a pet while having a follower out (for example, acat), it will be placed into theirinventory. When this occurs, the message in the chatbox will instead stateYou feel something weird sneaking into your backpack.This message also occurs if there is one last inventory space while the player already has a pet following them, in which case the pet will appear in the inventory instead and the resource dropped to the ground.[1]

On death, if a player loses their pet (as a follower or in your inventory) it will wander around for 30 seconds before disappearing completely. It can then be reclaimed fromProbitainEast Ardougnefor a reclaim token, which costs1,000,000coins.

Colours[edit|edit source]

Players can change the beaver's colour by first using thefunky shaped logon it, which is purchasable from theForestry Shop. This allows the player to change the beaver's colour by using certain logs on it. Once the funky shaped log is used on a beaver, the player may change the colour freely at any time by using the corresponding log on it. The log will be consumed.

Players can also permanently unlock the ability to transform the beaver into apheasantby using agolden pheasant eggon it, and into afoxby using afox whistleon it. These items are untradeable and rare drops from their respectiveForestry events, scaling with the player's Woodcutting level. These transformations donotrequire the funky shaped log.
