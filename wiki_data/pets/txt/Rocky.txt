[Pet: Rocky]

Rockyis a skillingpetthat can be obtained when training theThievingskill. This includes stealing from stalls, pickpocketing from NPCs, picking fruit in theSorceress's Garden, and looting grand gold chests withinPyramid Plunder. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's thieving level, and the person/object the player is stealing from.

When a player receives the pet, it will automatically try to appear as their follower. At the same time, a message in thechatboxwill stateYou have a funny feeling like you're being followed.However, if a player receives a pet while having a follower out (for example, acat), it will be placed into theirinventory. When this occurs, the message in the chatbox will instead stateYou feel something weird sneaking into your backpack.

If a player's inventory is fullandthey have a follower already, theywill notreceive the pet; it must instead be claimed fromProbitainEast Ardougnefor a reclaim token, which costs1,000,000coins.

Ondeath, if a player loses their pet (as a follower or in your inventory) it will wander around the area for 30 seconds before despawning. Even if the player returns in time, the pet cannot be picked up, and can be reclaimed from Probita for a reclaim token.

The fastest method on average to receive Rocky is by rapidly thieving stalls inRellekka,PrifddinasorDraynor Village Marketplace.

Trivia

The name is a reference to The Beatles' song "Rocky Raccoon".One of the possible dialogues for the red panda version is a reference to the 1994 filmThe Shawshank Redemption, as the player asks Red if it knows a raccoon named Dufresne, both the names of the two main characters.The Ziggy reference to being able to transform into a human could be a reference to theBake-danukiyōkai, which are most often associated with tanukis.In one of the possible dialogues with Ziggy, the player questions if the tanuki knows any plumbers. This may be in reference to theSuper Mariogame series, as both Mario and Luigi (who are plumbers) can obtain aTanookisuit in these games.Rocky is romantically interested in another racoon named Rodney, stating he wishes tostealhis heart.[7]
