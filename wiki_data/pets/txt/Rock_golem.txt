[Pet: Rock_golem]

Therock golemis a members-only skillingpetthat can be obtained while trainingMining. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Mining level, and the time it takes to gather a resource.

When a player receives the pet, it will automatically try to appear as their follower. At the same time, a message in thechatboxwill stateYou have a funny feeling like you're being followed.However, if a player receives a pet while having a follower out (for example, acat), it will be placed into theirinventory. When this occurs, the message in the chatbox will instead stateYou feel something weird sneaking into your backpack.This message also occurs if there is one last inventory space while the player already has a pet following them, in which case the pet will appear in the inventory instead and the resource dropped to the ground.[1]

On death, if a player loses their pet (as a follower or in your inventory) it will wander around for 30 seconds before disappearing completely. It can then be reclaimed fromProbitainEast Ardougnefor a reclaim token, which costs 1,000,000coins.

Colours[edit|edit source]

Players can change the rock golem's colour by using the desiredore(excludingblastedandlunar ore) while it is in the inventory or following the player. To revert the golem to its original form, players must use aplain rockon it.

Ore | Ore cost | Image | Chat head | Ore | Ore cost | Image | Chat head

Rock | 0 |  |  | Tin | −18 |  | 

Copper | −17 |  |  | Iron | −185 |  | 

Blurite | 0 |  |  | Silver | −58 |  | 

Coal | −138 |  |  | Gold | −150 |  | 

Mithril | −139 |  |  | Granite | −56(500g)−20(2kg)−1,060(5kg) |  | 

Adamantite | −846 |  |  | Runite | −10,346 |  | 

Amethyst | −3,545 |  |  | Lovakite | 0 |  | 

Elemental | 0 |  |  | Daeyalt | 0 |  | 

Most of these ores may be obtained by mining the respective rock or trading with other players. However, there are a few ores that are untradeable and players must mine/obtain the ore themselves:

Miningpiles of rockaroundFeldip Hillsfor regular rocks to revert colours, or mining/killingearth elementalsin theElemental Workshopas a guaranteed drop.The only source of Blurite comes from theAsgarnian Ice Dungeon. However, severalice warriorswander the mining area and will most likely interrupt low-level players mining the ore.Lovakite can only be obtained when mining in theLovakite Minewest ofLovakengj.Killing earth elementals with purple veins in the Elemental Workshop will always drop elemental ore.Veins of Daeyalt ore can be mined at theMeiyerditchorDaeyalt essence minesduring or after theDarkness of Hallowvalequest. Should players choose to mine at Meiyerditch or have no access toDarkmeyer, they can easily get the attention of avyrewatcharoundMeiyerditchand get sent to the mine. Daeyalt can be freely used on the rock golem if brought to the mine, but players may also choose to mine more Daeyalt to save for later after they have mined 15 ore for thevampyresin the mine.

Drop rates[edit|edit source]

Shown below are the base chances of receiving a rock golem.[2]When blast mining, the pet chance is rolled when you excavate the hard rock. At Volcanic Mine, it is rolled when ore fragments are received. Playerscannotobtain the rock golem from mining salts in thesalt mine[3],Daeyalt essence mine[4],dense essence mine, andsalt deposits.[5]

A player's actual chances of receiving it is1 in (B- (Lvl* 25)), whereBis the base chance andLvlis the player's Mining level.

The fastest method on average to receive the rock golem is through gemstones when mining underground in theShilo Village mine, and it can be further sped up withtick manipulation. If not using tick manipulation,Volcanic Mineis also recommended, as it is only slightly slower for receiving the pet while giving much betterexperiencerates.

While theMotherlode Mineis not an efficient method for getting the rock golem, in the process of obtaining theprospector kit,coal bag, unlocking the upper level, and upgrading the pay-dirt sack will on average take 23,481.78 actions for 580golden nuggets, giving an accumulative 1/10.98 chance for receiving the rock golem for the average player.
