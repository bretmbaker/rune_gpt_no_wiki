[Pet: Pet_rock]

Apet rockcan be obtained fromAskeladdenduring and afterThe Fremennik Trialsquest. After the quest multiple pet rocks can be obtained by talking to him again.

Rocks can usually find their own food, and don't often need attention, so rocks are a good choice for a pet. The pet rock is held in both hands, although it cannot be used as aweapon;unarmedattacks are instead used while the pet rock is equipped. The pet rock does not confer any stat bonuses or penalties.

Pet rocks will happily live in thecat basketormenagerieof aplayer-owned house. When dropped inside a house, it will responsibly stay in its spot, patiently waiting for the player to come back. Picking your pet rock up while standing in your POH Menagerie is a task in the MediumFremennik Diary.

The pet rock is not lost on death, despite being a pet, and instead loyally waits at the player's gravestone.

Uses[edit|edit source]

In The Fremennik Trials quest, it is used to convinceLallito give you some of his golden wool. A pet rock,cabbage,onion, andpotatoare the ingredients to make rock soup to please him.

Unlike most pets, the pet rock will not follow the player when it is dropped, possibly due to the rock's shy nature. Because of this, it can be used to substitute a player while attempting to open the two-man doors in theWaterbirth Island Dungeon. To get further into the dungeon, a partner has to destroy the door-support from the other side of the ladder, although a special attack of arune thrownaxecan do this instead.

TheXeric's talismancan be dismantled by using a pet rock on it, resulting in a message saying "You bash the talisman with the rock, smashing it into fang-like shards.".

Interactions[edit|edit source]

Your rock doesn't seem hungry.

Your rock seems much happier.

Talk-to

"Who's a good rock then? Yes you are... You're such a good rock... ooga booga googa."

Your rock seems a little happier.

Fetch

Want to fetch the stick, rock? Of course you do...

(Player puts the rock down and throws a stick which lands anywhere but forward. The rock will not move anywhere, because rocks naturally don't enjoy playing fetch. Player shrugs and picks the rock back up.)

Stay

"Be a good rock..."

(Player sets the rock down, and stand up for a few seconds. Then the player picks the rock up, and pets it.)
