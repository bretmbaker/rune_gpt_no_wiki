[Pet: Rift_guardian]

Therift guardianis a members-only skillingpetthat can be obtained while trainingRunecraft. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Runecraft level, the rune the player is crafting, and the number of essence used. Upon using theGuardian's eyeon it, which is purchased from theGuardians of the Riftreward shop for 3,000abyssal pearls, players can use it to change it into theGreatish guardian.

When a player receives the pet, it will automatically try to appear as their follower. At the same time, a message in thechatboxwill stateYou have a funny feeling like you're being followed.However, if a player receives a pet while having a follower out (for example, acat), it will be placed into theirinventory. When this occurs, the message in the chatbox will instead stateYou feel something weird sneaking into your backpack.

When runecrafting usingdark essence fragments, the pet is given after they are removed and the runes are given back.[1]This means if there is not already some of the runes to be crafted in the inventory, and the rest of the inventory is full, and a pet is already following the player, the Rift Guardian willnotbe given; it must instead be claimed fromProbitainEast Ardougnefor a reclaim token, which costs 1,000,000coins.

Ondeath, if a player loses their pet (as a follower or in your inventory) it will wander around the area for 30 seconds before despawning. Even if the player returns in time, the pet cannot be picked up, and can be reclaimed from Probita for a reclaim token.

Colours[edit|edit source]

The colour of the pet received is dependent on the altar at which the player's runes were crafted. Players can change its colour by crafting a rune at the desiredrunic altarwhile it is following the player. Thus, various colours will require different Runecraft levels. When runecrafting at theOurania Altarthe Rift Guardian will turn a random colour, but not necessarily that of one of the runes crafted. The player does not need to have the Runecraft level necessary to make a given rune in order to have their Rift Guardian become that rune's colour at the Ourania Altar. Furthermore, it is not possible for the Rift Guardian to change to its Wrath form via the Ourania Altar.

Should players wish to keep their Rift Guardian the same colour, they may do so via the right-click "Locking" option while it is following the player.

Drop rates[edit|edit source]

Shown below are the base chances of receiving a rift guardian.[2]Thepet chanceisrolled per essence crafted, not per rune crafted.

A player's actual chances of receiving it is1 inB- (Lvl* 25), whereBis the base chance andLvlis the player's Runecraft level.

The fastest method on average (excluding the use ofrunners) to receive the rift guardian is by craftingmind runes, using theMind Altar Teleport. However,lava runesare recommended, as they are only slightly slower for receiving the pet, but they are significantly better forexperience.

Crafting on runic altars during theGuardians of the Riftminigamewillnotgive players the pet.[3]
