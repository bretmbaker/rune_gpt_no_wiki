[Pet: Heron]

Theheronis a members-only skillingpetthat can be obtained while trainingFishing. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Fishing level, and the time it takes to gather a resource.

A heron can be turned into a great blue heron by feeding it 3,000spirit flakes. The recolouring can be reversed by feeding the great blue heron any raw fish, while one spirit flake can be used to turn it back to blue.

When a player receives the pet, it will automatically try to appear as their follower. At the same time, a message in thechatboxwill stateYou have a funny feeling like you're being followed.However, if a player receives a pet while having a follower out (for example, acat), it will be placed into theirinventory. When this occurs, the message in the chatbox will instead stateYou feel something weird sneaking into your backpack.This message also occurs if there is one last inventory space while the player already has a pet following them, in which case the pet will appear in the inventory instead and the resource dropped to the ground.[1]

On death, if a player loses their pet (as a follower or in your inventory) it will wander around for 30 seconds before disappearing completely. It can then be reclaimed fromProbitainEast Ardougnefor a reclaim token, which costs 1,000,000coins.

Drop rate[edit|edit source]

Shown below are the base chances of receiving a heron.[2]

A player's actual chances of receiving it is1 inB- (Lvl* 25), whereBis the base chance andLvlis the player's Fishing level. The only exception isFishing Trawler, which offers a 1/5000 chance  to obtain a heron following a successful trip at minimum, scaling up to a 1/2,500 chance with full contribution.[3]With minnows and karambwanji, the pet chance is rolled once each time fish are obtained (i.e. when experience is given), regardless of the number that were fished.

The fastest method on average to receive the heron is through2-tickfishing, specifically tuna and swordfish. If not using tick manipulation, karambwans are the fastest alternative, with a drop rate equivalent to reaching around level 94 or 95 fishing on karambwans alone.

To find the pet chance for a method at a given level, refer to theskill pet chance calculator.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The heron's dialogue is a quote from the 2003 filmFinding Nemo, in which Nigel, a pelican, attempts to save Dory and Marlin from seagulls by transporting them away in his mouth.The heron's dialogue is similar to a quote from Terminator 2: Judgement Day when Sarah Connor is fleeing the T1000 in the mental hospital. "Come with me if you want to live!"The great blue heron's dialogue makes multiple references:If offered burnt fish, the player will state that it is valuable, referring to other players who collect piles of burnt food.The heron's reply calling the player a dancing donkey is a combination of a reference to celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and theDancing Donkey Inn.If offered a cooked fish, the heron will demand that the player uncook it; when the player states that they cannot, the heron in turn remarks about a cat who mastered uncooking, referring toEvil BobandScapeRune.If offered eel sushi, the heron will talk about "bird culture", a reference to the popular cartoon Rick and Morty.Same wise, the quote "How could a member of my own house say something so horrible?" is a reference to the popular cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender.
