[Pet: Hellcat]

Ahellcatis a special cosmetic variant of a normalcatthat can be accessed after starting theFreeing Evil Davesub-quest ofRecipe for Disaster. During the quest, players must visitEvil Daveinhis mother's basement. There they must use their cat to killhell-rats, which have stolen his mother's special colouredspiceswhich are needed to make thespicy stewto free him. After your cat catches seven rats, it will become corrupt by the demonic nature of the rats and will suddenly transform into a hellcat.[1]Alternatively, killing thehell-rat behemothseven times will yield the same result.Kittenson the other hand have a chance to turn into hell-kittens on any hell-rat catch. Note that any existing hellcats may need to be placed in a menagerie, or transformed back in to an ordinary cat, in order for subsequent cats to be transformed. A hellcat can be turned back into a normal cat of the same colour it was before the conversion at any time by feeding it abucket of milk.

A cat at any stage of growth can be a hellcat, and a cat that has become a hellcat will continue to age as normal.[2]To get an overgrown hellcat you have to grow a younger hellcat into one (by having it following you for another 5-6 hours). Players who have completedRatcatcherscan also get wily and lazy hellcats, either by using their wily or lazy cats to catch Hell-Rats, or by taking an overgrown hellcat toFelkrashand having her train it.

Combat stats[edit|edit source]

When fightinghell-rat behemoths, theking rator in theRat Pits, hellcats have the following combat stats:[3]

Cat | Hitpoints | Attack | Strength | Defence

 | Hell-kitten | 4 | 1 | 1 | 0

 | Hellcat | 6 | 4 | 3 | 0

 | Overgrown hellcat | 10 | 3 | 5 | 0

 | Wily hellcat | 12 | 12 | 8 | 2

 | Lazy hellcat | 14 | 6 | 6 | 2

Training your overgrown/lazy hellcat into a wily hellcat[edit|edit source]

An overgrown cat can be transformed into awily cat(both normal and hellcat versions) by talking toFelkrashin thePort SarimRat Pits. They can also be given a name by speaking to her, allowing the player to input a combination of any six letters or spaces, but no numbers. Note that the name will be used in theRuneScapeinterface for every wily and lazy cat the player has.

When the wily hellcat eventually reverts to a lazy hellcat, it can be re-trained into a wily hellcat by repeatedly catching rats (both normal andhell-ratversions). Around 15 rats have to be caught before players can expect their lazy hellcat to turn wily again.[4]If the hellcat does not seem to transform after catching rats for an extended period of time, players can pick up their lazy hellcat and re-drop it to reset the 'training timer', as otherwise it may be possible to keep training them indefinitely to no avail.

It is not possible to re-train a lazy hellcat into a wily hellcat using aball of woolto play with them or by stroking it, only by chasing rats.[5]Likewise, having your cat chase amouse toywill not transform it back into a wily one.[6]Lazy hellcats are known to have a hidden activity level that is incremented by catching rats, which will in turn increase their catch rate as it is raised higher.[7]

Players are only allowed to have one wily or lazy hellcat out or in bank at a time, in addition to one kitten or adult cat, and as many overgrown cats as they wish. You can however have multiple lazy/wily cats by storing them in yourmenageriebefore training another. Players can store both lazy and wily cats in their menageries. Wily hellcats will not become lazy while in a menagerie.
