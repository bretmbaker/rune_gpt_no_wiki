[Pet: Phoenix]

ThePhoenixis apetthat can be received from looting theReward Cart, from which rewards are obtained by subduing theWintertodtwith at least 500 points.

When a player receives the pet, it will automatically try to appear as their follower. At the same time, a message in thechatboxwill stateYou have a funny feeling like you're being followed.However, if a player receives a pet while having a follower out (for example, acat), it will be placed into theirinventory. When this occurs, the message in the chatbox will instead stateYou feel something weird sneaking into your backpack.

Ondeath, if a player loses their pet (as a follower or in your inventory) it will wander around the area for 30 seconds before despawning. Even if the player returns in time, the pet cannot be picked up, and can be reclaimed fromProbitafor a reclaim token.

Though the Wintertodt is classified as a boss rather than a skilling activity, the phoenix is fifteen times more common at200 millionFiremakingexperience.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Prior to the removal ofsupply crates, it was possible to obtain a phoenix pet while in underwater areas such as theMogre CampandFossil Island'sunderwaterarea.Using abucket of wateron the Phoenix will result in the chatbox statingThe phoenix dodges the water. Doing so consumes the bucket of water entirely, including the bucket itself.The Phoenix's in-game model is a miniaturization of theDesert Phoenix'smodel.The Phoenix's standard dialogue makes several references to pop culture:The first and second dialogues are references to Solaire of Astora ofDark Souls.The "long night" mentioned in the first dialogue may be a reference toA Song of Ice and Fire.The Sacred Ash mentioned in the fourth dialogue could be a reference toPokémon, where Sacred Ash is an item associated with the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, who is based off of a phoenix. It is more likely that it just shares a common characteristic of mythical phoenixes of dying and being reborn from ash.Also in the fourth dialogue, the player's confusion about the sky is a reference to RuneScape not having a skybox.
