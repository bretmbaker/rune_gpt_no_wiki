[Pet: Little_nightmare]

TheLittle Nightmareis apetthat can be obtained by defeatingThe NightmareorPhosani's Nightmare. It is a much smaller version of her. The pet has a 1/800 drop rate in the original encounter, increasing by said amount for every additional player in the room when the fight started; 1/1600 in a duo, 1/2400 in a trio, 1/3200 in a 4-man and 1/4000 in a 5 or higher man encounter. At Phosani's Nightmare, the pet has a flat 1/1400 drop rate.

The little nightmare is able tometamorphoseinto a little parasite. For Little nightmare to be able to do so, players must use theParasitic Eggon her, a drop acquired from Phosani's Nightmare.

When a player receives the pet, it will automatically try to appear as their follower. At the same time, a message in thechatboxwill stateYou have a funny feeling like you're being followed.However, if a player receives a pet while having a follower out (for example, acat), it will be placed into theirinventory. When this occurs, the message in the chatbox will instead stateYou feel something weird sneaking into your backpack.

If a player's inventory is fullandthey have a follower already, theywill notreceive the pet; it must instead be claimed fromProbitainEast Ardougnefor a reclaim token, which costs 1,000,000coins.

Ondeath, if a player loses their pet (as a follower or in your inventory) it will wander around the area for 30 seconds before despawning. Even if the player returns in time, the pet cannot be picked up, and can be reclaimed from Probita for a reclaim token.
