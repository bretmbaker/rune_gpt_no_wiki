[Weapon: Robe Top Of The Eye#Green]


Therobe top of the eyeis a part of theRaiments of the Eyeset, purchased from theGuardians of the Riftreward shop for 350abyssal pearls. It grants 10% more runes whenRunecrafting, and is increased to 60% when the full set is worn.
The outfit can be recoloured using abyssal dyes (received from theRewards Guardian) to a red, blue, or green colour scheme. Each dye recolours one piece of the outfit, so three in total are needed to recolour a set, as the boots can't be recoloured.
