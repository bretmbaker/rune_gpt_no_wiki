[Weapon: Robe Of Elidinis (Top)]


TheRobe of Elidinis (top)is a robe top that is required in theSpirits of the Elidquest. The robes are created by using aneedleon thetorn robesfound in the shrine inNardahduring or after the quest. The player must wear the robes in order to enter theWater Ravine Dungeonfarther north along theRiver Elid. After the quest, players may use the robes to continue to access the dungeon, although few do.
You can get a new set of robes by searching the cupboard again for the torn robes and then remaking them with needle and thread. You cannot get another set of torn robes if you already have a set of torn robes or Robes of Elidinis in your possession (including in the bank). However, you can use theDrop trickto get extra sets by dropping your robes before searching the cupboard. This gets you a new set of torn robes, which you can mend when you wish.
