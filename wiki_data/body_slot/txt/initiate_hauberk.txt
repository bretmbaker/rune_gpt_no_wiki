[Weapon: Initiate Hauberk]


Theinitiate hauberkis a piece of Temple knight armour that requires 20Defence, 10Prayer, and completion of theRecruitment Drivequest to equip. It provides a small prayer bonus that matches theMonk's robe top, while retaining the defensive bonuses of aMithril platebody, and is commonly used duringSlayer tasksthat require the use ofprotection prayers, as the armour reduces the drain of prayer points.
If lost, another hauberk can be bought for 10,000 coins, but is usually much cheaper to buy from theGrand Exchange.
