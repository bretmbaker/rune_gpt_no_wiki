[Weapon: Black Robe]


ABlack robeis one of the basic pieces of chest armour for low levelMagicusers. Black robes are often dropped by thedark wizardsin the stone circle south ofVarrock. It has identical stats to theblue wizard robe, as well as itstrimmedandgold-trimmedversions. It can be created by usingblack dyeon a blue wizard robe; similarly, it can also be turned into a blue wizard robe by usingblue dyeon it.
The black robe is often worn with the blackwizard hatandblack skirtfor aesthetics. The hat has a slightly darker tone than the robes, instead more closely matching thepriest gown. This is not the case with the robe's trimmed versions.
