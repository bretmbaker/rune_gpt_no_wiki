[Weapon: Dragon Platebody]


Thedragon platebodyis an armour used inmeleeand the strongest of all standardplatebodies. It requires 60Defenceand completion of thequestDragon Slayer Ito equip.
It offers some of the highestbonusesof any non-degradable armour in the game, providing higher slash and stab defence than theBandos chestplate. For melee use it is a direct upgrade to thedragon chainbodyin every stat except crush, with the chainbody having +1 crush defence more than the platebody. Despite its high defensive bonuses however, the dragon platebody lacks a strength bonus, making it less commonly used for general melee training.
