[Weapon: Khazard Armour]


AKhazard armouris aquest itemin theFight Arenaquest. It is a dark colouredplatebodythat is part of theKhazard armour set. It has stats worse than abronze platebody, but unlike most melee armours, it does not have a penalty toMagicorRangedaccuracy, nor does it interfere withAva's devices, making it a viable choice for mages and rangers. It also weighs far less than a typicalplatebody. Another nearby quest item,Carnillean armour, has over double the stab defence and +3 slash defence bonuses, at the cost of -2 crush defence and nearly 20x theweight.
In the Fight Arena quest, aKhazard helmetand Khazard armour can only be found by searching thechestin a building north of theFight Arena. They both must be worn to enter the Khazard prisons. Unequipping either the helmet or armour inside the jail causes the guards to kick the player out.
