[Weapon: Rune Chainbody]


Arune chainbodyis achainbodymade ofrunite. To wear this chainbody, a player needs at least level 40Defence. This piece of body armour is less resistant than therune platebodyin all stats exceptcrushandmagicand wearing it does not require completion ofDragon Slayer I. For this reason it is commonly worn by players who have not finished said quest or who are fighting againstmonstersthat use crush attacks. It is also useful for rangers since it has higher defence bonuses than thegreen d'hide bodyand it does not penalise ranged attack.
A player with 96Smithingcan make the chainbody by using threerunite barson ananvil, granting 225 Smithingexperience. It can also be bought atScavvo's Rune Storein theChampions' Guild, or formembers, atSeddu's Adventurer's StoreinNardah.
