Guthan's platebodyismelee armourworn in thebody slotthat is part ofGuthan the Infested's setofbarrows equipment. To wear Guthan's platebody, a player must have 70Defence.
If Guthan's platebody is wielded together with all other pieces of Guthan's armour set, then successful melee attacks have a 25% chance of restoring health to the user equal to the damage dealt to the target. This set has the potential to be extremely useful in a variety ofcombatsituations, due to its healing reducing the need to bringfood. While the set has strong combat stats, its durability can be conserved through only equipping it when a player needs to heal, and carrying alternative non-degradable armour and weaponry.
