[Weapon: Dragon Chainbody]


Thedragon chainbodyis the highest tier ofchainbodyin the game, requiring aDefencelevel of 60 to equip. As with mostdragon armour, players cannot make this item using theSmithingskill.
Prior to the release ofBarrows armour, the chainbody was an extremely rare item, and was a status symbol for accomplished players. Today, the chainbody is not nearly as prestigious as it once was, and its lack of astrength bonusmeans it is often substituted with armour such as thefighter torsoforSlayertasks and generalmeleetraining, where maximising one'sdamage outputtakes precedence over defensive bonuses.
