Verac's brassardismelee armourworn in thebody slotthat is part ofVerac's equipment. To wear Verac's brassard, a player must have 70Defence.
Verac's brassard offers significantly lessmeleeandrangedprotection thanGuthan,ToragandDharok'splatebodies (which all have equal stats), however it is better than theRune platebody, with the exception of having -1 stab defence bonus. Because of this, Verac's brassard is rarely seen being used outside of the full set. However, Verac's brassard does not penalise ranged andmagicattack bonuses nearly as much as regular melee armour.
