[Passive Effect]
Against non-demonic enemies, Darklight is a fairly weak weapon with bonuses equivalent to that of asteel longswordwith a lower strength bonus and a small, additional Magic Defence bonus. When using Darklight to fight againstdemonicmonsters, the player's maximum hit is increased by 60%.[1]Darklight also counts as a piece ofsilver weaponry, and can therefore damagetier 2 vampyres, while gaining a 10% damage bonus againsttier 1 vampyres.


[Special Attack]
A player performing the darklight's special attack,Weaken.
Darklight has aspecial attack,Weaken, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and lowers the opponent'sStrength,Attack, andDefencelevels by 5% (10% fordemons) of their base level + 1.[2]
The accuracy roll forWeakenis made against an opponent's stab defence,[3]and its drain effect only applies tosuccessful hits.
Weakenwill stack additively uponsuccessful hitsunlike thedragon warhammer, which stacks multiplicatively. Two successful special attacks thus reduce an opponent's Strength, Attack and Defence by 10% + 2, or 20% + 2 against demonic targets.
