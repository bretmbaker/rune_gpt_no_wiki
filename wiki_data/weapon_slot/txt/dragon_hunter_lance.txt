[Weapon: Dragon Hunter Lance]


Thedragon hunter lanceis a one-handeddragonbane weaponcreated by using ahydra clawon aZamorakian hasta. Equipping the lance requires level 78Attack. Additionally, it requires completion of the Firemaking (not the pyre step), Fishing and Smithing sections of theBarbarian Trainingminiquest. In addition, the Smithing section requires completion of theTai Bwo Wannai Trioquest(as well as speaking withTamayufirst, as it is required to learn Barbarian Smithing techniques). As it is created from aZamorakian hasta, it will act as aZamorakitem within theGod Wars Dungeon.
When attempting to create the dragon hunter lance, a warning will appear in the chatbox stating that the process cannot be reversed, and a confirmation will appear afterwards asking if players would like to proceed with the alchemical combination. Should the player confirm, the chatbox will state:You successfully combine the Hydra claw and the Zamorakian hasta to create the Dragon hunter lance.
