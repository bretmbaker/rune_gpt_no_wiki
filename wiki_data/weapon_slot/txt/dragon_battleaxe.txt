[Special Attack]
A player using the dragon battleaxe's special attack,Rampage.
The dragon battleaxe has aspecial attack,Rampage; when toggled, the player character immediately hefts the weapon above their head and bellowsRaarrrrrgggggghhhhhhh!, consuming 100% of their special attack energy. This drains the player'sAttack,Defence,Ranged, andMagiclevels by 10%, while increasing theirStrengthlevel by 10 + (levels drained / 4), rounded down.
The strength boost is comparable to that of asuper strengthpotion. However, depending on the player's combat levels and pre-existing boosts, it can raise Strength by up to 21. Barring overload potions or an imbued heart, doing this requires a minimum of 97 Ranged and 96 Magic, as well as 99 Attack and 92 Defence (or vice versa if the player chooses to drink a saradomin brew). Players can then drink aZamorak brew,super restore,super defence,ranging potionandmagic potionbefore using the dragon battleaxe special attack to have more levels drained, which in turn increases the Strength boost. This allows players with 99 Strength to reach 120, the highest possible in the game outside theTombs of Amascut.
The special attack providing an unlimited amount of Strength boosts accounts for the popularity of this weapon; although the weapon itself is seldom used in combat, it is entirely possible to useRampagefor a strength boost and then revert to a primary melee weapon. The drained stats can be recovered using arestore potion, or anattack/super attackpotion if only melee damage output is a concern.
In order to make full use of the special attack without boosts, your Attack, Defence, Ranged and Magic need to be at 90, using the special attack will reduce each by 9 points which will raise your Strength by 19 points (10+reduction/4).
Alternatively, drinking from afancy/ornate rejuvenation pooleffectively eliminates the stat drain and special energy cost ofRampagewhile retaining the Strength boost. ThePool of RefreshmentinFerox Enclavewill reset both boosts and drains, so it cannot be used for this purpose.
