[Special Attack]
A player performs the dragon hasta's special attack,Unleash.
The dragon hasta has aspecial attackcalledUnleash, which drains the player's special attack bar and attacks with a 5% boost in accuracy and a 2.5% boost in damage for every 5% of special attack energy used. Notably, it ignores the 40% damage reduction fromProtect from Meleeif the opponent has the prayer active.[1]This special rolls off of the opponents stab defence regardless of which mode it is in.
For example, a player with 100% special attack energy who performs the special attack will have 100% increased accuracy (meaning the accuracy is doubled) and a damage boost of 50%.
