[Special Attack]
A player performs the special attack of the Dragon crossbow,Annihilate.
The crossbow has aspecial attack,Annihilate, which drains 60% of the special attack bar and hits up to 9 enemies in a 3x3 area. The player will roll for accuracy, and if it succeeds, then rolls for a hit between 0 and the usual maximum hit from the regular attack. The primary target of Annihilate will take 20% extra damage, and all other targets will take 20% less damage. For example, if a hit of 25 is rolled, the primary target will get 30 damage and the other targets will get 20 damage. If used in asingle-way combatarea, the attack will still work but only hit one target with 20% extra damage.
Enchanted boltscannot activate their effects when using the dragon crossbow's special attack.[1]
