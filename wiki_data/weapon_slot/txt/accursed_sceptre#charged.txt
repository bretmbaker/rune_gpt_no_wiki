[Passive Effect]
When the accursed sceptre is charged withrevenant ether, an additional 50% magic accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking anyNPCin theWilderness, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not. It is also applied to anycombat spellscast when it is equipped, though it cannotautocastthem in powered staff mode.
This effect will stack with aSlayer helmet (i)or aSalve amulet(i)and their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes the sceptre the best magic weapon in the Wilderness, surpassing the damage output of atrident of the seasorswampwith the additional capability of attacking any hostile players, which both tridents are incapable of doing.


[Special Attack]
A player performing the Accursed sceptre's special attack,Condemn.
The accursed sceptre has aspecial attack,Condemn, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and 1revenant ether(whether it hits or not). The special attack hits an enemy with a 50% increase to max hit and accuracy, and upon asuccessful hit, also drains the target's Defence and Magic by 15%, regardless of the damage inflicted.[1]
If the target's levels have already been reducedCondemnwill only drain them to a maximum of 15%. As a result, multiple special attacks do not stack. For example, a target with level 80 Defence and Magic cannot have their stats drained lower than 68 if using Condemn.
