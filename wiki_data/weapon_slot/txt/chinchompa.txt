[Weapon: Chinchompa]


Chinchompasare one-handed, multi-target, stackableRanged weaponsrequiring level 45Rangedto wield. Chinchompas can be obtained bybox trappinggrey chinchompasin thePiscatoris Hunter area, theKourend Woodland, or on theIsle of Souls. This requires 53Hunterand completion of theEagles' Peakquest, and will give the player 198.4 Hunter experience per catch. They have a catch rate of about 146/255 at 53 Hunter and a guaranteed chance to catch at 95 Hunter.[1]To use chinchompas incombat, they must be wielded in theweaponsslot. Chinchompas are thrown likedartsorthrowing knives; however, they explode on impact. InPvM, they can hit up to 11 targets in a 3x3 area. InPvP, the cap is 9 targets. They cannot be picked up again from the ground after being thrown, andAva's devicedoes not return them. Throwing a chinchompa at a group determines the maximum hit for the whole group, so if the chinchompa hits a 0 on one member of the group, it will hit a 0 on all of them; if it hits a 10 on one member of the group, it will hit up to 10 on all of them. The accuracy roll made on the initial target uses the 'heavy' ranged defence for determining the opponent's defence roll.[2]
Attack speed: Fuses are used to describe the attack speed for throwing chinchompas. It is just another name for the conventional styles of ranged attacks.
