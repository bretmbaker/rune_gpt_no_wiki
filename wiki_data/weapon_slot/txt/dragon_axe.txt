[Special Attack]
A player performs the dragon axe's special attack,Lumber Up.
The dragon axe has aspecial attack,Lumber Up, that it shares with theinfernal,3rd age, andcrystal axesand their variants. Ittemporarily booststhe player'sWoodcuttinglevel by 3, consuming 100% of the player's special attack energy. The boost degrades every 60 seconds, with the player's Woodcutting level returning to normal after 3 minutes. UsingPreservecan increase the duration by 50%.
The special attack can be used to allow players to chop with the axe itself starting at level 58 Woodcutting, although it cannot be used without the level 60Attackrequired to wield the axe.
Note that any levels boosted above 99 with the special attack will be treated as 99. Therefore, you will start to receive diminishing returns with the special attack at level 97 and 98[2], with visible boosts past level 99 only influencing thepetandclue nestchances.[3]
