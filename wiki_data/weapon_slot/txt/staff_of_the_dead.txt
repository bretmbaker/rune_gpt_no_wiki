[Special Attack]
A player using the staff of the dead's special attack,Power of Death.
The staff has aspecial attack,Power of Death, that halves all of the opponent'smeleedamage, consuming 100% of the player's special attack energy. Upon activating the special attack, a message will appear in the player's chatbox:Spirits of deceased evildoers offer you their protection.
The effect lasts for one minute after using the special attack, but is inactive while the staff is unequipped during that minute, until the staff is equipped again. Re-equipping the staff before taking damage from another source will still reduce incoming damage until the effect runs out. In addition, the effect stacks with the PvP damage reduction effect of theProtect from Meleeprayer. The effectdoes notstack with itself should the player manage to cast the effect more than once before the initial cast expires.
