[Weapon: Abyssal Whip]


Theabyssal whipis a one-handedMelee weaponwhich requires anAttacklevel of 70 to wield. The whip is among the most powerful and popular non-degradable melee weapons and is capable of attacking at the same speed ofdaggersandscimitarsat 2.4 seconds per hit. As it performs great against monsters that are weak toslashattacks and is relatively affordable, it is one of the most widely used melee weapons in the game and is a popular choice used to train theSlayerskill at higher combat levels before more powerful weapons become accessible.
The whip is a big upgrade over thedragon scimitar, which has the same attack speed but significantly lower accuracy and strength bonuses. However, it is easily outperformed by higher tier weapons such asOsmumten's fang,Inquisitor's mace,Blade of Saeldorand theGhrazi rapier. A major downside of the abyssal whip is that it is not effective for trainingStrength; the only attack option available which will provide Strengthexperienceis the "lash" attack option, which is acontrolledattack style and provides shared experience. As a result, several slightly weaker weapons are instead ideal for training Strength directly.
