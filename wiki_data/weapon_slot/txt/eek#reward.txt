Eekis a small spider that plays a part in the2018 Halloween event. She can be found in the small graveyard north of the church next toRimmingtonandPort Sarim. She understands humans, due to spiders spending much of their time in human settlements. She got her name from the scared exclamation "eek", as it was a sound she liked.
