[Special Attack]
A player performing the Zaryte crossbow's special attack,Evoke, withenchanted diamond bolts.
The Zaryte crossbow has aspecial attack,Evoke, which consumes 75% of the player's special attack energy. The special attack provides doubled accuracy on the next shot, and guarantees the special effect of anyenchanted boltsused, provided that the player lands asuccessful hiton the target.
Enchanted ruby boltsare the most popular bolts to use withEvokein mostbossencounters, as successful hits can guarantee that 110 damage is dealt, assuming the enemy's health is high enough. Coupled with natural procs, this makes it a great option for speed-basedCombat Achievementtasks.
For prolonged encounters, wearing thelightbearerwill make this combination even more powerful.
