The abyssal dagger has the same strength bonus as theZamorakian hasta, but is generally considered the inferior stab weapon due to 10 less stab accuracy, no prayer bonus and no defensive stats. However, the hasta's combat styles are limited to Defensive and Controlled (shared). While set to Aggressive, the dagger can achieve one additional max hit. As with mostdaggers, it can bepoisoned.

[Special Attack]
A player performs the abyssal dagger's special attack,Abyssal Puncture.
The abyssal dagger has aspecial attack,Abyssal Puncture, which hits twice in quick succession with a 25% increase in accuracy and 15% reduced damage, consuming 25% of the player's special attack energy. A single attack roll is performed, meaning that either both hits are successful, or both hits miss. The damage calculation rolls against the opponent's slash defence.
The highest the dagger can possibly hit with its special attack is 44-44 against players and 50-50 while using asalve amulet (e)againstundeadcreatures. The abyssal dagger's special attack is notedly weaker than thedragon dagger's; this is evident when comparing the abyssal dagger's max hit of 44-44, to the dragon dagger's max hit of 50-50. However, it is more accurate against higher defence monsters due to its higher attack bonuses. This makes it a more accurate option at the cost of max hits.
