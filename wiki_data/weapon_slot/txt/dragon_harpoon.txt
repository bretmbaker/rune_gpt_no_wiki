[Special Attack]
A player performs the dragon harpoon's special attack,Fishstabber.
The dragon harpoon has aspecial attack,Fishstabber, that provides a visible +3 boost toFishing. This consumes 100% of the player's special attack energy. Special attacks require the player to wield the weapon, so this Fishing boost cannot be used without the 60Attackrequired to wield the harpoon.
Also note that any levels boosted above 99 with the special attack will be treated as 99. Therefore, you will start to receive diminishing returns with the special attack at level 97 and 98, with there being no value in speccing at level 99.[1]
