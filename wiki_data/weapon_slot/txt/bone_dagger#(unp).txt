[Special Attack]
A player performing the bone dagger's special attack,Backstab.
The bone dagger has aspecial attack,Backstab, (75%) which will never miss as long as the target has not been HIT previously or you weren't the last one to damage the target. It lowers the target'sDefenceby the amount of damage dealt, similar to theBandos godsword's andDorgeshuun crossbow's special attacks. The defence lowering is only applied when the target doesn't currently have their defence levels lowered.[1]Backstab'saccuracy is not guaranteed onKephriupon entering her room, nor againstDuke Sucellusafter he is woken up.
While the weapon can be used prior to theDeath to the Dorgeshuunquest, the special attack can only be used after completing it.
