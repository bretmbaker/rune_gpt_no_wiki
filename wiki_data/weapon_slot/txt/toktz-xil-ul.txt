[Weapon: Toktz-Xil-Ul]


Toktz-xil-ulare obsidian throwing rings that require level 60Ranged. They are quite powerful, having stats equivalent to amagic shortbowin conjunction withrune arrows, making them one of the more powerful thrown weapons. Because of this, and the fact that they can be equipped with ashield, they are seen inPvPscenarios quite often even after the introduction ofdragon knives. However, they are significantly more expensive than rune arrows, making them less practical for general use.
