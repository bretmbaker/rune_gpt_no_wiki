[Weapon: Infernal Axe#Charged]


Theinfernal axeis a special type ofaxethat is created by using asmouldering stoneon adragon axe. The axe requires anunboostedlevel of 61Woodcuttingand 85Firemakingto create. Creating the axe grants 350 Firemaking and 200 Woodcutting experience.
While chopping a tree with the infernal axe in the inventory or equipped, there is a 1/3 chance that the logs will be consumed as they are chopped, giving half of the Firemaking experience that would usually be gained by burning them the normal way. For example,redwood logsthat are burnt by the infernal axe (which doesnotrequire level 90 Firemaking) will grant 175 Firemaking experience rather than the 350 experience that is granted by burning it normally. Experience gained from logs burnt by the infernal axe is increased by thePyromancer outfitbonus.
