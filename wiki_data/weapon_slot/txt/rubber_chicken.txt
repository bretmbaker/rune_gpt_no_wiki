[Weapon: Rubber Chicken]


ARubber chickenis aevent rewardthat can be obtained by completing anEasterholiday event, which occurs once per year.
The Rubber chicken can be equipped and has the same attack styles as awarhammer. It gives very large attack penalties and is nearly useless as an actual weapon. As such it is allowed duringfun weaponfights in legacy duels within theEmir's Arena. When wielded, players will see a "Whack" option on all other players. Picking that option will cause the player to hit the other player. The hit is just an animation and no damage is dealt, nor does it count as entering combat. If a player whacks a large number of other players, they may "fumble" the chicken, dropping it to the ground where it must be picked up again and re-equipped.
