[Special Attack]
A player performs the rune thrownaxe's special attack,Chainhit.
The rune thrownaxe has aspecial attack,Chainhit, that ricochets off the target and hits multiple other opponents within a 3 tile radius (forming a 7x7 square centred on the target) at the moment the special attack is initiated.[1]Chainhitcan only ricochet to other enemies in amulticombat area. This special attack can target up to 5 opponents, but a rune thrownaxe will not rebound back to its original target after chaining to another enemy.[2]Furthermore, an accuracy roll is made after each target hit by the thrownaxe, which will end the sequence if failed.[3]
Each hit consumes 10% of the player's special attack energy, i.e. three hits consumes 30% energy. This special attack uses a custom form of damage calculation that does not take into account offensive Prayers (such asEagle Eye) when determining a player'smaximum Ranged hit.[4]In addition, the attack speed ofChainhitis one tick slower than the rune thrownaxe's regular attack, meaning the attack interval is 5 ticks (3.0s) on the rapid style, and 6 ticks (3.6s) on accurate or longrange.
The following formula can be used to calculate the max hit ofChainhit:Maximum Hit=⌊0.5+(Visible Ranged Level+10)*(Ammo Ranged Strength+64)640⌋[a][b][c][d]
^Only the player's visible ranged level matters. Boosts given through prayers and Void Knight armour are ignored.^A stance bonus of 10 is used regardless of attack style used.^The ranged strength bonus of the player's armour and gear is ignored. Only the ranged strength bonus of the player's ammo is used. In the case of Rune thrownaxes, the weapon's ranged strength is used instead.^The bonus damage usually provided by wearing a Slayer helmet (i), Salve amulet (i) or Salve amulet (ei) is ignored.
