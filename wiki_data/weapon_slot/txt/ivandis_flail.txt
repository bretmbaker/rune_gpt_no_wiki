[Weapon: Ivandis Flail]


TheIvandis flailis a one-handedmeleeweapon created by theplayerduringA Taste of Hopefrom achain, anenchanted emerald sickle (b)and therod of Ivandis. The flail requires anAttacklevel of 40 to wield, and gives a 20% damage bonus againstvampyres. It can alsoautocastspells.
This flail is effective in damaging and killing thevyrewatchbecause, despite their sufficient mind-reading ability to predict attacks and avoid damage, the flail is incredibly unpredictable and random. The sickle head further increases the unpredictability of the weapon. Thus, attackers do not hit the Vyrewatch in the intended way, rendering their mind-reading useless.

[Special Attack]
A player performs the Ivandis flail's special attack,Retainer.
The Ivandis flail has a special attack,Retainer, which traps avampyre juvenileorjuvinatethat has less than 50% hitpoints remaining, preventing it from retaliating for 30 seconds. This consumes 10% of the player's special attack energy.
Even if the attack fails to activate, stating eitherThis spell can only be used on vampyre juveniles or vampyre juvinates.orThis spell only works against vampyres with less than half of their health remaining., it will still incur the normal attack delay, so take care not to accidentally use it in those circumstances.
