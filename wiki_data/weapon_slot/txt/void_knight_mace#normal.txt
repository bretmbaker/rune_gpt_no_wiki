Its stats are relatively close to therune mace's stats, with the main difference being its 25% slowerattack speed. It also has +2 bonus in Stab, Slash, and Crush attack, as well as Stab, Slash, Crush, Magic, and Ranged defence, as well as a relative +2 Strength and Prayer bonus compared to the rune mace. Due to its role as one of the weapons to cast Claws of Guthix, it also has a +8 Magic attack bonus.
