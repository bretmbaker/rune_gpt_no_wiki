[Special Attack]
A player performs the rod of Ivandis' special attack,Retainer.
The rod of Ivandis has a special attack,Retainer, which traps aVampyre JuvenileorVampyre Juvinatethat has less than 50% hitpoints remaining, preventing it from retaliating for 30 seconds. This consumes 10% of the player's special attack energy.
Each special attack consumes one charge from the rod. After all charges have been used, the player will be left withrod dustin their weapon slot.
Even if the attack fails to activate, stating eitherThis spell can only be used on vampyre juveniles or vampyre juvinates.orThis spell only works against vampyres with less than half of their health remaining., it will still incur the normal attack delay, so take care not to accidentally use it in those circumstances.
