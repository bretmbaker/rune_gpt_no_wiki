[Weapon: Phoenix Crossbow]


ThePhoenix crossbowis aquest item, although it can be traded. It has the same stats as a regularCrossbow, but weighs significantly less. It can be obtained and is used in the questShield of Arrav. The Phoenix crossbow has no requirements to wield, and can only firebronze bolts.
The Phoenix crossbow is not often used, as theBronze crossbowrequires the sameRangedlevel to equip, but gives a Ranged accuracy of +18, whilst the Phoenix crossbow only gives +6. However, the Phoenix crossbow is essentially free, and sinceBronze crossbowsand above aremembers-onlyitems, the Phoenix Crossbow is the best crossbow available tofree-to-playplayers, on par with the standardCrossbow.
