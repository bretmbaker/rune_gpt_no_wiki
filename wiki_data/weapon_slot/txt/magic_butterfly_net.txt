[Weapon: Magic Butterfly Net]


Amagic butterfly netis an item used in theHunterskill. It is wielded to captureimplings, andbutterflies or mothsthroughoutGielinorandPuro-Puro, and bats in theChambers of Xeric. A player must have a Hunter level of 17 in order to wield a magic butterfly net. Catching an impling without animpling jarwill automatically loot it, and catching a butterfly or moth without abutterfly jarwill automatically release it, unless you are in Puro-Puro. A jar is required to keep them for later use.
The magic butterfly net can perform the same actions as an ordinarybutterfly net, however the magic butterfly net increases the player's chances of capturing butterflies, implings, moths, and bats[1]by about 7.8%(20/256).[2]
