[Special Attack]
A player performing Emberlight's special attack,Weaken.
Emberlight'sspecial attackuses a version ofWeaken, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and lowers the opponent'sStrength,Attack, andDefencelevels by 5% (15% fordemons) of their base level + 1.[1]This is a +5% improvement to Arclight and Darklight's 10% drain on demons but is otherwise the same.
The accuracy roll forWeakenis made against an opponent's stab defence,[2]and its drain effect only applies tosuccessful hits.
Weakenwill stack additively uponsuccessful hitsunlike thedragon warhammer, which stacks multiplicatively. Two successful special attacks thus reduce an opponent's Strength, Attack and Defence by 10% + 2, or 30% + 2 against demonic targets.
