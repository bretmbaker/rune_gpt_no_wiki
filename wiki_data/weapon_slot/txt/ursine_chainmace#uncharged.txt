[Passive Effect]
When an ursine chainmace is charged withrevenant ether, an additional 50% melee accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking anyNPCin theWilderness, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not. Attacking with the mace outside of the Wilderness will still consume charges.
This effect will stack with aSlayer helmetor aSalve amuletand their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes it the best melee weapon in the Wilderness for PvM, surpassing the maximum hit of anelder maul, while having the same attack speed as anabyssal whip.


[Special Attack]
A player performing the ursine chainmace's special attack,Bear Down.
The ursine chainmace has aspecial attack,Bear Down, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and is only usable whilst charged. The special attack hits an enemy with doubled accuracy, and upon asuccessful hit, also deals 20 damage over 6 seconds, prevents running for 3.6 seconds (6 ticks), and reduces the target's Agility level by 20.
The accuracy roll forBear Downis based on the offensive bonuses of one's currently select style, which is rolled against an opponent's slash defences.[1]
