[Special Attack]
A player performs the blisterwood flail's special attack,Retainer.
The blisterwood flail retains theIvandis flail's special attack,Retainer, which traps avampyre juvenileorjuvinatethat has less than 50% hitpoints remaining, preventing it from retaliating for 30 seconds. This consumes 10% of the player's special attack energy.
Even if the attack fails to activate, stating eitherThis spell can only be used on vampyre juveniles or vampyre juvinates.orThis spell only works against vampyres with less than half of their health remaining., it will still incur the normal attack delay, so take care not to accidentally use it in those circumstances.
