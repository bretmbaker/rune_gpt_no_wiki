[Weapon: Ancient Sceptre#Normal]


Theancient sceptreis an upgraded version of theancient staffthat requires level 70Magic, 60Strength, and 50Attackto wield. It is made by bringing theancient iconand staff toEblis. This combination process is irreversible. As the icon is an untradeable drop from thePhantom Muspah, the sceptre requires completion ofSecrets of the Northto create.
The ancient sceptre, like its predecessor, can be used toautocastspells from theAncient Magicksandstandard spellbook. Unlike the ancient staff, the ancient sceptre provides a 5% Magic damage bonus, as well as apassive effectthat increasesthe effectsof Ancient Magicks by 10%. This passive effect does not increase the Magic damage bonus.

[Passive Effect]
The ancient sceptre has a passive effect which increases the effects of all Ancient Magicks by 10%:
SpellBuffed effectSmoke RushPoison severityis increased to 11, up from 10.(Poison caused by these spells starts with 1 hit of 3 damage, instead of starting at 2 damage.)Smoke BurstSmoke BlitzPoison severityis increased to 22, up from 20.(Poison caused by these spells starts with 2 hits of 5 damage, instead of starting at 4 damage.)Smoke BarrageShadow RushOpponent'sAttacklevel is reduced by 11% instead of 10%.Shadow BurstShadow BlitzOpponent'sAttacklevel is reduced by 16.5% instead of 15%.Shadow BarrageBlood RushSuccessful hits heal the caster by 27.5% of the damage dealt instead of 25%.[a]Blood BurstBlood BlitzBlood BarrageIce RushIce Rush receives no buff from using the sceptre.[b]Ice BurstOpponent is frozen for 17ticks(10.2 seconds) instead of 16 ticks (9.6 seconds).Ice BlitzOpponent is frozen for 26 ticks (15.6 seconds) instead of 24 ticks (14.4 seconds).Ice BarrageOpponent is frozen for 35 ticks (21 seconds) instead of 32 ticks (19.2 seconds).
^This stacks multiplicatively withbloodbark armour; when worn alongside the ancient sceptre, successful hits heal the caster by 38.5% of the damage dealt.^A 10% increase to Ice Rush's freeze duration is 8.8 ticks. As most calculations almost always round down due to the game's engine, this effectively results in no buffs for Ice Rush.
