[Weapon: Mithril Pickaxe]


Themithril pickaxeis apickaxethat is weaker than theadamant pickaxe. However, since both it and theblack pickaxegive the player an opportunity to mine every 5 ticks, there is no benefit to it over the black pickaxe, unless combat is also required. It requires anAttacklevel of 20 to wield, and aMininglevel of 21 to mine with. It can be used in combat or in mining to mine rocks. It is also one of the lightest pickaxes in the game (although again, heavier than the black pickaxe), making it ideal for activities such as trainingRunecraftvia the Abyss.
