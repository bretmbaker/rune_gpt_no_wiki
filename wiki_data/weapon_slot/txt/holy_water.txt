[Weapon: Holy Water]


Holy wateris aRangedweapon that is used just likethrowing knivesanddarts; however, it will only deal damage againstdemons. Throwing holy water will cause the vial to break, droppingsmashed glasson the floor. This makes holy water a single-use weapon. Holy water is non-tradeable and has a +6 Ranged attack bonus when wielded. As ademonbane weaponit gains a 60% damage bonus versus demons on top of a +5 damage bonus if the demon isNezikchened. It also grants bonus accuracy by draining the opponent's Defence level by 5%, provided it is a demon.[1]
Holy water uses a different form of damage calculation compared to how regularmaximum Ranged hitsare determined, which ignores some factors that normally serve to increase Ranged damage.[2]For instance, while boosting one's visible Ranged level will result in an increased maximum hit when using holy water, the use of stat-boosting prayers such asEagle EyeorRigourwill not, nor does the set effect ofVoid ranger armourapply to holy water.[3]
