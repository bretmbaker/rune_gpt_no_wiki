[Weapon: Blood Ancient Sceptre#Locked]


Theblood ancient sceptreis a sceptre requiring 75Magic, 60Strength, and 50Attackto wield. It is made by attaching theblood quartz, dropped byVardorvis, to theancient sceptre; this process can be reversed, allowing players to switch between quartzes as desired.
Like its predecessor, it will increase the effects ofAncient Magicksby 10%, with the added effect of being able to overheal up to 10% over the player's baseHitpoints. This only applies to singular hits that heal at least 10 Hitpoints; multiple hits that add up to at least 10 Hitpoints healed do not benefit from the passive effect.
