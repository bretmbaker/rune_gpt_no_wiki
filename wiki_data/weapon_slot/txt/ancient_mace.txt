[Special Attack]
A player performing the ancient mace's special attack,Favour of the War God.
The ancient mace has aspecial attack,Favour of the War God, requiring 100% special attack energy, that hits throughProtect from Meleeand drains thePrayer pointsof the opponent by 100% of the amount hit, recharging the user's prayer points by the same amount. This can raise your current Prayer points to above your maximum Prayer level - up to the amount of damage inflicted by the attack. The accuracy roll of the special attack is based on the attack bonus of the player's current style, which is rolled against an enemy's crush defence.[2]
The special attack will restore prayer even if used against a target that has immunity to conventional weaponry such asTurothsandKurasks, making this a useful special attack on slayer trips for restoring prayer. It is a useful tool while in theNightmare Zonefor restoring prayer after activating a power surge power-up, which gives the player infinite special attack energy. To maximise the number ofprayer pointsrestored, activating a strength-boosting prayer and drinking strength boosting potions before using the special attack is advised.
