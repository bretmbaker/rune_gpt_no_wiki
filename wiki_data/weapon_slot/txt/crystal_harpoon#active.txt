While fishing, the charged harpoon provides a 35% increased catch rate over the regular harpoon(a 12.5% increase compared thedragon harpoon), the highest for all harpoons. This effect only works on fish that utilise the harpoon (sharks etc). Whilst fightingTempoross, an additional effect transforms 1/3 of caught fish intoCrystallised harpoonfish, which grant 20% more fishing experience when used as ammunition.
