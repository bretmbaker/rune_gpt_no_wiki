[Passive Effect]
A player attacks an opponent with the Viggora's chainmace.
When Viggora's chainmace is charged withrevenant ether, an additional 50% melee accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking anyNPCin theWilderness, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not. Attacking with the mace outside of the Wilderness will still consume charges.
This effect will stack with aSlayer helmetor aSalve amuletand their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes it the second best melee weapon in the Wilderness for PvM after theursine chainmace, surpassing the maximum hit of anelder maul, while having the same attack speed as anabyssal whip.
