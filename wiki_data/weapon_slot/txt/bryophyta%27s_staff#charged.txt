[Passive Effect]
While equipped and charged, the staff has a 1/15 chance of not consuming a charge when any spell that uses anature runeis cast. When the staff's effect activates, the messageYour staff saved you a nature rune.is displayed. If a spell costs multiple nature runes to cast, only one rune is saved by the staff in case of a successful activation.[1]When a charge is saved, it can be saved again at the same chance. The average number of charges per nature rune (if casting a spell that costs one nature rune per cast) can be represented as a geometric seriesS(x)=x∑n=0∞15−n, which converges to (15/14)x ≈ 1.071x charges per x nature runes. Thus the effective number of nature runes for a fully charged staff is 1,071.43 on average, with a 95% chance of lying between 1,055 and 1,089.
At current market prices, this saves an average of8.21 coinsper rune consumed, meaning approximately1,744,776casts are required before the staff will pay for itself, without considering the opportunity cost of saving other coins by using an elemental staff. However, considering the elemental runes used may result in a loss. For example, casting high alchemy with a Bryophyta's staff instead of a fire staff results in an average cost change of−16.79 coinsper cast (though the use of aTome of fireat the same time would negate this). When selling back the staff, assuming only the 1% GE tax is used as cost with the Tome of fire, approximately17,448casts are required before one would start turning a profit from using the staff. When usingHigh Level Alchemyat max efficiency (1200 cast per hour), one would expect a profit after approximately14.6hours of alching.
