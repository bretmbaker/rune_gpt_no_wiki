[Passive Effect]
When Thammaron's sceptre is charged, an additional 50% magic accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking anyNPCin theWilderness, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not. It is also applied to anycombat spellscast when it is equipped, though it cannotautocastthem when using the staff's built in spell.
This effect will stack with aslayer helmet (i)or aSalve amulet(i)and their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes the sceptre the second best magic weapon in the Wilderness after theaccursed sceptre, surpassing the damage output of atrident of the seasorswampwith the additional capability of attacking any hostile players, something which both tridents are incapable of doing.
