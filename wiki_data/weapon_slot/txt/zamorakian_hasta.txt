[Weapon: Zamorakian Hasta]


TheZamorakian hastais made by taking aZamorakian speartoOtto Godblessed, along with a payment of 300,000coins(only 150,000 if the player has completed theElite Kandarin Diary). It is the third most effective stab weapon behind theGhrazi rapierandOsmumten's fang. Despite the examine text calling it aspear, the Zamorakian hastadoes notdeal full damage when fighting theCorporeal Beast.
It is a popularweaponagainst enemies weak tostab, such asdragons. Due to its reasonablecrushbonus, it is also often used against enemies weak to crush, such asVet'ion. It also possesses the highest defensive bonuses for a one-handed melee weapon in stab, slash, and ranged. All of the stat bonuses remain the same as a Zamorakian spear, and it retains itsspecial attack. As the hasta can be wielded with off-hand equipment such as ashieldordefender, it is preferable over the spear in all instances except when fightingCorporeal Beast.

[Special Attack]
A player performs the Zamorakian hasta's special attack,Shove.
The Zamorakian hasta has aspecial attack,Shove, which it shares with thedragonandZamorakian spear. It pushes an opponent back andstunsthem for three seconds, consuming 25% of the player's special attack energy.
The effects of this special are non-stackable, meaning that players cannot use the hasta's special attack on a target who is already stunned. In addition to this, players are given a one tick (0.6 seconds) period of immunity after a stun wears off in which they cannot be stunned again. In addition to this, as soon as the stun wears off, the stunned player is also granted a 5 tick (3.0 seconds) period of immunity against being bound in place by binding spells likeEntangleorIce Barrage.
In addition, it cannot be used against large monsters, such as giants, because they are too big to push back. If a player tries this, a regular attack occurs and no special attack energy is consumed. A message appears in the chat box, reading, "That creature is too large to knock back!" A general way to tell if the hasta can use the "Shove" special attack is to determine how much space the target monster takes up. If it takes up more than one space, it cannot be shoved. For example, a player can shove anice warrior, which takes up one space, but not anice giant, which takes up four.
