[Passive Effect]
When used againstdemonicmonsters, Arclight provides a 70% increase in accuracy and damage. Like Darklight, Arclight also counts as a piece ofsilver weaponry, and can therefore damagetier 2 vampyres, while gaining a 10% damage bonus againsttier 1 vampyres.
Duke Sucellusis a lone exception to the passive effect, as he possesses 30% resistance to demonbane, which gives Arclight a 49% accuracy and damage increase compared to the normal 70%.
This means that in certain cases, Arclight can have higher damage output than typical high-damage weapons such as theBlade of SaeldororScythe of Viturwhen fightingK'ril Tsutsarothordemonic gorillas.


[Special Attack]
A player performing Darklight's special attack,Weaken.
Arclight retains Darklight'sspecial attack,Weaken, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and lowers the opponent'sStrength,Attack, andDefencelevels by 5% (10% fordemons) of their base level + 1.[1]
The accuracy roll forWeakenis made against an opponent's stab defence,[2]and its drain effect only applies tosuccessful hits.
Weakenwill stack additively uponsuccessful hitsunlike thedragon warhammer, which stacks multiplicatively. Two successful special attacks thus reduce an opponent's Strength, Attack and Defence by 10% + 2, or 20% + 2 against demonic targets.
