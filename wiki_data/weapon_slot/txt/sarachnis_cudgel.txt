[Weapon: Sarachnis Cudgel]


Sarachnis cudgelis a one-handed crush weapon dropped bySarachnis, requiring level 65Attackto equip. The weapon appears to be made from several of Sarachnis' legs bound together by her webs.
The cudgel has slightly better crush and strength bonuses thanViggora's chainmaceand slightly lower bonuses than theLeaf-bladed battleaxe, although with a faster attack speed than the latter. This makes it a good crush weapon which does notdegradeor require a charge.
