Players can obtain the staff by using a knife on adramen branch, which requires aCraftinglevel of 31. It is possible to return toEntranaand cut more branches from theDramen tree, although it is advised players make multiple staves upon completion of the quest, as this prevents the need for a return trip should the staff be lost.
