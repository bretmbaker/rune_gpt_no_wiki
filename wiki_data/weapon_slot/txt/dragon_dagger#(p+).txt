[Special Attack]
A player performing the dragon dagger's special attack,Puncture.
The dragon dagger'sspecial attack,Puncture, deals two hits at once with an extra 15% accuracy and 15% damage for each of the two hits, consuming 25% of the wielder's special attack energy.Puncturerolls against opponent's slash defence roll.
When used against other players, both hits are applied simultaneously. There is a slight delay between the two hits when the special is used on NPCs.
The special attack's highest possible hit under normal combat conditions is 50 damage for each of the two hits, or a total of100damage. Although rare, the poisoned dagger's special attack can occasionally stack with thepoisondamage, resulting in a theoretical damage stack of 106. Against a slayer target with aBlack maskorSlayer helmequipped, the maximum becomes 54 per hit, dealing a maximum of108damage.
For these reasons, the dragon dagger is a staple 'knock-out' weapon inPvPcombat, and a cheap option for a high damage spec weapon inPvM.Dragon clawsare often superior, but carry a much higher price.
