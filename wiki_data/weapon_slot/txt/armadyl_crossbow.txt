[Special Attack]
A player performing the Armadyl crossbow's special attack,Armadyl Eye.
The projectile from the special attack.
The Armadyl crossbow has aspecial attack,Armadyl Eye, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. Armadyl Eye will, for one shot, double the player's overall accuracy (level + gear accuracy), as well as doubling the base chance of anenchanted bolt's special effect to occur.
For example, when performing the special attack withenchanted diamond bolts, the bolt's special effect,Armour Piercing, would have a 20% chance of activating instead of 10%. If theHard Kandarin Diaryhas been completed, the additional chance given from the diary reward is also added,[1]meaning the chance of activating for that shot is increased from 10% to a total of 21%.
