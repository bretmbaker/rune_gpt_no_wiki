[Special Attack]
A player performing Statius's warhammer's special attack.
Statius's warhammer has aspecial attack,Smash, that consumes 35% of the player'sspecial attack energyand deals between 25% and 125% of the user's max hit, while lowering the target'scurrentDefencelevel by 75% on asuccessful hit.
Defence level reductionsdo stackover multiple successful hits; each reduction is calculated from the current temporary level (so follow-up drains reduce fewer levels). Two successful special attacks thus reduce an opponent's Defence by a total of ~93%.
