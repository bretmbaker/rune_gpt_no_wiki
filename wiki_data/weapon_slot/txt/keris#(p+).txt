It deals 33% bonus damage against allkalphitesandscabarites, and has a 1/51 chance of puncturing a hole in their exoskeleton, dealing triple damage. When the special effect occurs, the chatbox will display the game message:You slip your dagger through a gap in the creature's chitin, landing a vicious blow.This message is not displayed if the effect deals less than 10 damage, which can cause the activation frequency to appear lower than it is in reality.[1]

It has the second-highest bonus of the threeprayer bonus-providing daggers, giving +2 compared to thewhite dagger's +1 andWolfbane's +5.
