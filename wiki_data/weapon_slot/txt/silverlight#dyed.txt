[Passive Effect]
Against non-demonic enemies, Silverlight is a fairly weak weapon with bonuses equivalent to that of asteel longswordwith a lower strength bonus and a small, additional Magic Defence bonus. When using Silverlight to fight againstdemonicmonsters, the player's maximum hit is increased by 60%.[1]Silverlight also counts as a piece ofsilver weaponry, and can therefore damagetier 2 vampyres, while gaining a 10% damage bonus againsttier 1 vampyres. This unusual use case is the only source of information that confirms Silverlight is indeed made of silver.
