[Weapon: Zombie Axe]


Thezombie axeis abattleaxethat requires 65Attackto wield. It is created by taking abroken zombie axe, obtained as a drop fromarmoured zombies, to an anvil and repairing it with 70Smithing.
The axe's strength bonus and slash attack stats are higher than any other one-handed weapon, while its crush attack bonus is only surpassed by thedragon warhammerandinquisitor's mace(not counting PVP-only weapons). Coupled with its 5-tickattack speed, the axe does slightly less average damage than thedragon scimitaragainst enemies with low to semi-low defence. However, against enemies weak to crush or enemies with higher defence, such as agargoyle, the axe can potentially deal even more average damage than anabyssal whip. This is particularly useful for midgameironman playerswho do not have level 85Slayerto killabyssal demons.
