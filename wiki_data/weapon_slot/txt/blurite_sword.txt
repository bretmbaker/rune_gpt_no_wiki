The blurite sword has the same attack and defence bonuses as asteel longswordwith the strength bonus of aniron longsword. It is slightly worse thanSilverlight. Because of this and the fact that there is no Attack level needed to wield it, the blurite sword is sought by some lower level players at the start of the game.
