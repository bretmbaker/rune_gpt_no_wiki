[Weapon: Torva Full Helm (Unobtainable Item)]


This variant of theTorva full helmis an unobtainable version of the regularTorva full helm, which resembles its appearance prior to the 3 August 2023 graphical update.
Thegraphical update to Torva armourwas done with the reasoning that it was not "consistent with Old School's art style", and a non-trivial number of players disagreed with said change, mostly due to nostalgia towards its iconic appearance in its original release inRuneScape 2in 2011.
