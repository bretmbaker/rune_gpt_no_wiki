[Weapon: Warrior Helm]


Awarrior helmis a piece ofarmourthat can be worn by players who have completedThe Fremennik Trialsquest and have aDefencelevel of 45. The helm can be bought at theSkulgrimen's Battle Gearshop inRellekkafor 78,000coins. It's also a possible reward fromBarbarian AssaultHigh Gambles.
Due to its lack of a strength bonus, the warrior helm is far less popular than its counterpart, theberserker helm, despite having a smallslashbonus (+5) and better defence against the slash attacks (+33 instead of +29). However, it is a good alternative to thefighter hat, assuming those who plan to use the warrior helm are using a slash weapon, especially considering that it provides slightly better resistance to all attacks.
