[Weapon: Highwayman Mask]


Thehighwayman maskis a black mask similar to the oneshighwaymenwear. It can be obtained  fromEasyTreasure Trails.  Some players argue that it is very different, but when shown on a player while in game, they look almost identical to the ones worn by theNPChighwaymen. However, the only highwayman to be featured in chat isRick Turpentine, who looks like the player in chat.
These masks, like many other accessories, do not give any combat bonuses. Players who have completed theCabin Feverquest can take the mask and aBlack cavaliertoPatchyonMos Le'Harmless, and have them sown together to create aCavalier and maskfor 500coins. The highwayman mask can be worn along with a plain blackCape, brownFremennik shirt, andSteel swordto resemble the highwayman himself.
