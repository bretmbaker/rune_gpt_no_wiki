[Weapon: Armadyl Helmet]


TheArmadyl helmetis an item that can be obtained fromKree'arraand his bodyguards in theGod Wars Dungeon, or as an extremely rare drop from anArmadylean/Bandosian guardfrom elite coordinate clues. Along with theArmadyl chestplateandchainskirt, it is part of theArmadyl armourset, and requires 70DefenceandRangedto wear.
The helmet has the second highestrangedattack bonus of any item in theheadwear slotbehind theMasori mask, however, it penalises both melee and mage attack bonuses, which makes the helm somewhat undesirable in situations where multiple attack styles are used.
