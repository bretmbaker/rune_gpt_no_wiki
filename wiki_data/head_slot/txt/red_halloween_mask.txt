[Weapon: Red Halloween Mask]


TheRed halloween maskis a tradeable cosmetic item. Red halloween masks can be obtained by completing one of theHalloweenholiday eventsthat occur once per year. This also rewards the player with all other holiday items associated with Halloween.
After the playerbase was polled, it was decided that all tradeable rares will be distributed during their corresponding holiday events thus making them seasonal rares and not completely rare, this to prevent them from being worth hundreds of millions of coins again, like inRuneScape.
