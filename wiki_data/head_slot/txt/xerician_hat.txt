[Weapon: Xerician Hat]


TheXerician hatis part of theXerician robesset. Equipping the Xerician hat requires the player to have at least 10Defenceand 20Magic.
Its stats are identical to those ofgnome hats,Canifis hats, and theFremennik hat, apart from the other alternatives all weighing more (0.453kg vs. 0.2kg). Because of this, the Xerician hat isn't as cost-effective as the rest of the Xerician robe set, particularly in high-risk PvP activities.
