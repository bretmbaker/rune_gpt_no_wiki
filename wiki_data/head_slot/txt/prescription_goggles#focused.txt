[Weapon: Prescription Goggles#Focused]


Theprescription gogglesare a piece of thealchemist's outfitpurchased from theMixology Rewardsshop with 8,600Mox resin, 7,000Aga resin, and 9,350Lye resin, which are earned from participating in theMastering Mixologyminigame. The goggles can be cosmetically changed between a focused and unfocused variant when in the inventory.
When worn, the goggles give a 10% chance to save asecondary ingredientwhen mixingpotions. As the saved ingredient has another chance to be saved with subsequent potions, this means that each secondary has an added value of 11.1%, or that only 90 secondaries are needed for each 100 mixed potions on average. With stackable secondaries, the chance to trigger only occurs once per potion, saving a secondary for each dose the potion has (up to 4 equivalents for a 4-dose potion); no in-game text is displayed when secondaries are saved. When gaining an extra potion dose using a chargedalchemist's amulet, you do not consume an equivalent of secondary for the extra dose.
