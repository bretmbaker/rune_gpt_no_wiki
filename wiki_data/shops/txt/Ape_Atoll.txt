Ape Atollis an island in theSouthern SeaofGielinor, home to a vibrant population ofmonkeys. The settlement ofMarim, where the monkeys reside, is under the rule ofKing Awowogei. It is only accessible to players who have partially or fully completed theMonkey Madness Iquest.

Players who have not taken the form of a monkey using agreegreewill find themselves the target ofaggressivecreatures throughout the island. Being spotted by the monkey locals or interacting with them may result in the player being knocked out and sent to the prison in Marim. However, upon completion ofMonkey Madness II, a greegree becomes unnecessary for this purpose as all surface inhabitants become tolerant towards the player.Monkey zombiesandskeletal apesremain aggressive to those without a greegree, however.

The island is teeming with dangers includingNinja Monkey ArchersandNinja Monkey Guards,Gorilla Monkey Guards, poison-inducingjungle snakesandspiders, and environmental hazards such as a collapsing cave. As a result, Ape Atoll is widely regarded as one of the most hazardous regions inRuneScape, particularly for those new to the challenges it presents.

Transportation[edit|edit source]

Initial access to Ape Atoll requires the player to first travel viaLumdoonCrash IslandduringMonkey Madness I. To get there, speak toDaero[1]on the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]of theGrand Tree. From there, haveWaydarfly you to Crash Island.

There are several alternative transportation methods available after completion ofMonkey Madness I:

The spell takes the player to the safe upstairs section of theTemple of Marimboin the north-east corner of Ape Atoll.The level 90Ape Atoll Teleportin theArceuus spellbook, as well as the equivalentmagic tablet, takes players to theApe Atoll Dungeonon the southern part of the island.TheGnome glider networkcan take players to the north-west of the island after completion ofMonkey Madness II. The fastest way to access the glider network is by climbing to the top floor of theGrand Tree.

Furthermore, completion ofMonkey Madness IIgrants access toApe Atoll bank.

Situated at the eastern edge of the city lies theTemple of Marimbo, which is home to severalMonkey Guards. The temple is a popular low-intensity training area, as there is a prayer altar inside. Players can use theProtect from Meleeprayer to avoid damage and automatically fight the Monkey Guards until their prayer runs out, as long asAuto Retaliateis turned on andMonkey Madness IIis not completed.

TheTemple of Marimbo Dungeoncontains a large quantity ofMonkey Zombiesand is an effective location forRangedtraining.

Agility course[edit|edit source]

TheApe Atoll Agility Courselocated south of Marim is available at level 48Agility. At lower Agility levels, the failure rate on obstacles makes efficient training unfeasible. You will need aNinja monkey greegreeorKruk monkey greegreein order to make use of the course. After completion ofMonkey Madness II, players can obtain aMonkeywhich they can equip on their back. The monkey can be transformed into six other variants by completing laps at the agility course. Note that laps will only begin to be tracked upon completion of Monkey Madness II;Bobawucan tell players how many laps they've completed.

Ape Atoll Dungeon[edit|edit source]

TheApe Atoll Dungeonis a winding maze that has many dangerous areas. They include traps that can hit up to 8,spidersthatpoisonstarting at 1, and undead monsters capable of hitting over 20. Theaggressiveskeletal apesfound here come in large quantities and provide high experience rates if killed withMulti-hitting attacks, such aschinchompasandburst/barrage spells.

Hardwood trees[edit|edit source]

Ape Atoll features a decent supply of hardwood trees. At the south-west corner of the island stand twoMahogany trees, each slightly spaced from the other. Additionally, near the destination of theApe Atoll Teleport spellwithin theArceuus spellbook, threeTeak treesgrow in close proximity to each other. These trees can be cut with a Greegree in hand, so that players can safely chop them down in a manner that ensures that the nearby monsters remain passive.

Fishing spots[edit|edit source]

There are twospotsforBig netandHarpoonFishingsituated on Ape Atoll. One is positioned to the east of the agility course, while the other is found at the extreme south-western corner of the island. They can be fished forraw mackerel,raw cod,raw bass,big bass,raw sharkandbig shark. There are also non-fish items such ascasket,leather boots,leather gloves,oysterandseaweed.

Kruk's Dungeon[edit|edit source]

West of Marim lies the entrance toKruk's Dungeon, accessible both during and after the events ofMonkey Madness II. Alight sourceis needed to traverse its underground levels. Similar to the Ape Atoll Dungeon, this labyrinth provides an excellent arena for training using Multi-hitting attacks, with itsManiacal monkeyinhabitants offering the potential for even greater experience rates. Furthermore, at level 60Hunter, players can capture certainManiacal monkeysby setting aDeadfall trap. Theirtailscan be used to stringBallistae.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Despite its name, Ape Atoll is not an actualatoll.The name Ape Atoll is a reference to the Monkey Island point and click adventure games.Ape Atoll is considered to be a difficult area to make changes and adjustments to in content updates, as it was primarily designed by internRahul Vohrain the summer of 2004. Vohra's background was in object-oriented programming, and his code is less intuitive and more difficult for Jagex's developers to work with than Jagex's own scripting system designed for non-programmers.
