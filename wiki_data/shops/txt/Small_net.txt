Trivia[edit|edit source]

Prior to theChristmas Event 2018 update, ironmen were not able to pick up small fishing nets thatspawnedon the ground, including the ones in the Wilderness near theBandit Campand in theLumbridge Swamp, due to preventing an exploit taking priority over the fix.[1][2]Iron players who disconnect whilst using small nets in a hunter activity are currently unable to pick the net back up upon logging back in. Ropes remain unaffected.
