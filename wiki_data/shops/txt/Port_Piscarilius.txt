Port Piscariliusis one of the five cities in the Kingdom ofGreat Kourend. Led byLady Shauna Piscariliusof the Piscarilius House, the city is a port primarily inhabited by fishermen who rely on the fishing industry for their source of income, in addition to overseas trade. All visitors from the mainland often come through here orLand's End.

The port is known for its high crime rate, with newcomers to the kingdom warning other new arrivals of the thieves that run rampant in Port Piscarilius. This is due to the political corruption within the Piscarilius authorities, allowing thieves and smugglers such asCaptain Khaledto steal artefacts from houses in the residential district through bribery, and shipping the stolen goods overseas. It can be accessed by travelling by boat by talking toVeosin Port Sarim.

Favour (historical)[edit|edit source]

Prior toan updateon10 January2024,favourwas a core mechanic of each city onKourend. Historical information about gaining favour and its benefits is documented below.

Gaining favour[edit|edit source]

Earning Piscarilius favour can be done by assisting with repairing the fishing cranes, taking fish to the market, huntinggrubson the beach and stealing artefacts from houses.

To progress in theArchitectural Allianceminiquest, players must gain 100% Piscarilius favour and speak toPiliar, who is found in the building directly north-west of the general store.

There are fivefishing cranesfound throughout Port Piscarilius that consistently break, and must be repaired: three are found outside the foodhall (two west and one south) and two on the dock withLeenz's General Supplies.

In order to repair fishing cranes, players must be at least level 30Crafting. Players will also need ahammer, somenails(of any type), and threeplanksto repair a fishing crane. Each fixed crane awards 0.5% favour, in addition to an amount of Crafting experience equal to three times the player's Crafting level.Leenz's General Suppliessellsiron nailsif players need them.

It takes three planks and up to 100 nails (depending on the player's Crafting level) to repair one crane. Obtaining 20% favour requires 120 planks and approximately 1,000 nails. Players with high Crafting levels may use no more than 40 per crane; at 99 Crafting repairing a crane takes about 15 nails on average.

The more people that are working, the faster the crane gets repaired, so it is recommended to repair cranes with other people, likely found in busier worlds. If you cannot find other players, repair the same crane that the dock worker is repairing. The cranes break very quickly, often making hopping unnecessary; however, players may hop worlds looking specifically for broken cranes.The unofficial world for this activity is 303.

It's recommended to stay at the two cranes by the general store, as this allows one to sell notedplanksto the general store for 0 coins and buy them back for 1 coin, saving bank trips. Keep the majority in your inventory as small amounts disappear from the store or can be bought by other players. This does not work forironmendue to the store becoming overstocked. Alternatively, aplank sackcan be used, allowing players to carry an additional 28 planks.

The easiest method of gathering planks forultimate ironmenis to use theLovakengj Minecart Networkto travel to theWoodcutting Guild, cut regular trees, turn them into planks at the sawmill, and take the minecart back to the Piscarilius area. If the Minecart Network isn't unlocked, an alternative is to walk from the Woodcutting Guild toVeosand use him to travel to Port Piscarilius.

Once players reach 15% favour, players with level 15Fishingcan assistFrankiein deliveringfresh fishto thecooling chestinsidehis storefor favour. Fresh fish degrades into nothing after about a minute, so players must be fast.

It is recommended to collect fresh fish from the three barrels directly west of Frankie. Players can pick up around 20 fresh fish before they start disappearing (but you can do 25 if you are good at it). Players gain an average of 0.4% favour per delivery, and are granted some Fishing experience as well.

This method is quite a bit slower than repairing fishing cranes and it is recommended to stick with repairing fishing cranes from 15% favour to 20%.

Once players reach 20% favour, they can start theThe Queen of Thievesquest. This quest requires completion ofClient of Kourendand level 20Thieving. Completion of the quest will grant aPiscarilius favour certificateworth 10% favour.

This is the fastest method of gaining favour; After players reach 30% favour, players with level 15 inHuntercan hunt forsandworms(10 Hunter experience per find) in the area north ofTynan's Fishing Supplies. Doing so requires aspadeand at least fivebuckets. Eachbucket of sandwormsdelivered toTynanrewards around 0.36% favour. The shop also has a large stock of buckets. It is recommended to bring coins, as Tynan takes the entire bucket instead of emptying them. Abankis also nearby to the west.

The chance of obtaining sandworms is between 65% and 75% depending on the player's Hunter level.[1]

In order to dig up the worms faster, once the animation begins, the player can begin running to the next location.

Ironmenmay choose to save thebuckets of sandfor trainingCraftingwithglassblowing.

Once players reach 75% favour, players with level 49 inThievingcan talk toCaptain Khaledin the foodhall south-east of the bank to get an assignment. Players will need alockpickto pick the lock on the drawers, and they will have to avoid being caught by the patrolmen. A successful heist awards a few hundred coins, and 2% Piscarilius favour. In addition you earn 750 Thieving experience for successfully picking the lock and retrieving the artefact and additional Thieving experience equal to 40 times your Thieving level for safely delivering the artefact toCaptain Khaled. Note, if you logout or teleport after acquiring the artefact but before you safely deliver it you will report to Khaled that you lost the item and will have to get another task.

Earning 100% favour will take players several hours of doing cranes,fresh fish, or less than an hour of digging for sandworms.Players can bring notedplanksandmoneyto sell and buy back an inventory's worth of planks using thegeneral store.Always use the west-to-east method when collectingfresh fish, and leaving 20 inventory slots open will help you remember when to deliver your fish.After the buff was applied to the rate of obtaining sandworms, it is recommended to dig sandworms from 30% to 100% favour. Collecting a full inventory ofsandwormstakes a couple of minutes and nets you around 10.4% favour (26 buckets), so it's quite a bit faster than the other methods.

Favour benefits[edit|edit source]

At 20% favour, players can accessKenelme's Wares.At 30% favour,Frankie's Fishing Emporiumwill start stocking some of its inventory.At 75% favour, players can helpCaptain Khaledsteal artefacts from the residential district in Port Piscarilius.Training Thievingin this manner grants moderate experience per hour.At 100% favour, players can catchanglerfishwith afishing rodandsandwormsas bait.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Piscarilius is named after Pisces, the Latin plural for fish, and changing syllables from the namePiscatoris.Upon release, speaking to various NPCs within Port Piscarilius will reveal that the Port Piscarilius is governed by a Lord Piscarilius. However, with the release of theWintertodt, speaking toIsh the Navigatorrevealed that he was there on Lady Piscarilius' orders. When asked about this inconsistency, Mod Ash stated"Having two people share the governance seems like a good idea to me if they also need to make long trade voyages."[2]Withan updateon15 June2017, all references to Lord Piscarilius were replaced with Lady Piscarilius.
