Kandarinis a region in the realm ofGielinorruled byKing LathasofEast Ardougne. Unlike any other human nation, there is a democratic government inArdougne, the Ardougne city council. The council, however, has little sway compared to the monarchy. It encompasses most of the lands west ofWhite Wolf Mountain. Kandarin is bordered by another mightykingdom,Asgarnia, to the east, theFremennik Provinceto the north, the forests ofTirannwnto the west and theFeldip Hillsto the south. Kandarin is one of the largest kingdoms in Gielinor, nearly as large asGreat Kourend.

Kandarin is a wealthy kingdom, and nearly as powerful as the Kingdom ofMisthalin. It gathers much of its wealth through industries in places such as theSeers' VillageandYanille. It also trades with many of its bordering nations.

The region has numerous dealings withKaramjaisland: sourcing some of itsArdougne Zoomonkeysfrom there, having established ship routes, having peculiar interests in theKharazi Jungle, having at least one instance of pilfering atribaltotem from the island by one of its nobles, operating a sand exporting business fromBrimhaven, and even possibly having a secret shipyard headquartered on the island.

Kandarin also faces an abundance of emergent issues throughout:

In 136 of theFifth Age, the former king,King Ulthas, died in a hunting accident before he could decide who his heir would be. His two sons,LathasandTyras, split the city between themselves.King TyrasofWest Ardougnehas abandoned his city to a terrible plague after leaving for a crusade in theElvenlands ofTirannwn. The city faces grossly impoverished conditions while being confined by a quarantine. WhileEast Ardougneenjoys much more prosperity, it is still rampant with theft and bears anxiety of the West's plague possibly breaking through.Goblins litter the region, occupying theObservatory's dungeon or engaging in hostilities with the dwarves by theFishing Guildin addition to their usual disruptive behaviour.The Sinclair estate finds tragedy at theSinclair Mansioninvolving the murder of the head of household. There also seems to be some connection between their formerly-ownedCamelotcastle and theKinshra.Sea trollson the north-west coast are causing problems forKing Lathasin thePiscatoris Fishing Colony.There is a growing disturbance in the coastal town ofWitchavenand theirFishing Platformconcerning the eeriesea slugs.ThegnomesandGeneral Khazard'sarmy are locked in warfare, which exacerbates a growing distrust towards humans among some of the gnome populace.Problems have cropped up inYanilleinvolving thesand businessand theWizards' Guild.Construction efforts for theTower of Lifeproject have ground to a halt as its workers have gone on strike.

History[edit|edit source]

Before The Fourth Age[edit|edit source]

Relatively little is known about the specifics of Kandarin prior to the Fourth Age. The aftermath of theGod Warsleft the region utterly brutalised and bereft of its inhabitants, which in turn meant that anything that could have served as archaeological records were erased. It is said that thegnomeshad a city in Kandarin at one point that enjoyed a healthy trade relationship with the elves, but were reduced to a measly village by the end of theGod Wars.[1]Seeing as the elves moved to isolationism within Tirannwn during theThird Agethat had largely been unbroken (with exception toZalcano)[2][3], it can be assumed the elves and gnomes established their mercantile relations prior to the God Wars, and thus the latter would have founded their city some time before the height of the God Wars in the Third Age.

Contemporaryhumansettlements, likewise, must have seen a similar fate to their gnomish counterparts and were razed.

TheFeldip Hillsarea saw a united ogre-goblin conglomerate under the leadership ofBandos, but fell apart after theEdicts of Guthixbanished the god at the end of the Third Age and sent theogresandgoblinsinto discord.[4]

The Fourth Age[edit|edit source]

Early into the Fourth Age, the intellectualScorpiuslooked to the heavens to deepen his knowledge of worldly and divine matters. He constructed theObservatoryto achieve this goal, spearheading the study of astronomy. He then came to rely on the cooperation of Zamorakians, but would fall victim to an ousting and suppression by the Ardougnian monarchy of Zamorakian worship and related endeavors. In time, this attitude became lax and Scorpius' work drew attention to scholars invested in the field who now continue his work.[5]

Following the end of theGod Wars, the start of the Fourth Age saw the elves break from their isolationist policy and seek to expand west.[6]Theelven clan of Cadarn, headed byLord Baxtorian Cadarn, led a campaign of elves east fromTirannwnthrough theArandarmountain pass into Kandarin, where they met with and attempted to establish diplomatic relations with the major races that persevered through the God Wars crucible— namely, the gnomes in northern Kandarin, humans to the far east, and the goblins and ogres to the south. The gnomes readily accepted a peace agreement (they could not have done otherwise due to their disheveled state).Oaknockbegan work on theTree Gnome Stronghold. The humans, at that point, comprised mainly of scattered, disunited tribes[7][8]and would not become a burgeoning power until after the departure of the elves almost two millennia later; however, they eventually agreed it would be in their universal best interests to opt into a peace pact with the elves. The ogres and goblins in theFeldip Hillsarea met them with less success, due to the aforementioned chaotic climate following the banishment ofBandos.[9]Apparently during this time, theMahjarratwere absent, though the region would see the return ofHazeelandGeneral Khazardlater on by the end of the age.[10]

With major peace agreements secured, King Baxtorian was able to afford constructing a new elven province in the region, particularly with his own militarily-competent clan in support to fend off would-be hostile elements from the tumultuous south.[11]Settling aroundBaxtorian Fallswith his wife,Glarial, the elven leader of its namesake established his kingdom in Kandarin. As the soon-to-be kingdom was gaining traction, news of the success caught on back east in Tirannwn, inspiring more settlers to head on over west and join the Cadarn clan.[12]The elves, gnomes, and humans enjoyed tremendous profit under their tripartite union. On the contrary, the ogres and goblins only ever saw more brutal infighting; specifically, the ogres began to engage in a genocide of the goblins.[13]Goblins started spilling in from the southern region into Kandarin to compete for territory, who would eventually be the primary rivals to the gnomes in the coming age after the departure of the elves in the Fourth Age.[14]

By Year 1930, however, theIorwerth Clanswept through the elves' home city ofPrifddinasand seized control of it. Subsequently, contact between Prifddinas and Baxtorian's Kingdom halted, which garnered alarm in the latter.[15]After learning of the civil war back west, Baxtorian led a campaign to recapture and liberate Prifddinas from the assailants. Concurrently, as he and his best soldiers he could muster were occupied with their campaign in Tirannwn, their kingdom in Kandarin they had just left was, itself, plunged into war (whether by invasion or uprising) in their absence.[16]In the end, Baxtorian did not successfully quash Iorwerth's insurrection and was forced to turn back to their territory east through theUnderground Passwith his forces, only to find the previously prosperous kingdom in ruin. On learning that his wife had been taken, her location and retrieval became an immediate priority there, alongside getting his people to safety.[17][18]However, he failed to find her, and having been exhausted from the conflicts in both of his homes and a hapless pursuit to find his lover, he pinned his hopes on the sliver of chance she would live through this tragedy and sealed himself in the Baxtorian Falls, where she would come to awaken him.[19]Unfortunately, Glarial's body had later been recovered and her remains placed in an urn laid to rest in thetombdedicated to her near Baxtorian Falls.[20]

From then on, the elves withdrew from Kandarin, leaving yet another power vacuum in the region. Immediately after their departure, the gnomes of the north and the goblins of the south began to contest the newly available land for the taking.[21]Around the Ardougne area, the two had their armies meet for battle, and thus theBattle of Atarisundriwas had. The gnomes found quick and decisive victory afterGlouphrie the UntrustedandKing Healthorgschemed to frighten the goblins into retreat right at the outset by demonstrating their might with a great number of illusory giant tortoises.[22]

Following the battle was a prosperous time for the gnomes; however, it did not reach the heights of their elven predecessors. One of their primary setbacks was the assassination of the ancientspirit treeArgento, which led to the exile of the once-exalted Glouphrie due to his complicit involvement in concealing the tree's death.[23]Their small statures would also hinder their ability to hold hegemony of Kandarin compared to the rise of adversaries like the humans that started to consolidate under united banners. This human threat, in particular, had severely stifled the progression of the renewed gnome civilisation and, to some dismayed gnomes likeGlough, demeaned their existence by forcing them to have to live defensively against them. By the end of the Fourth Age, the gnomes are cited to have been forced to withdraw from the surface world for an unspecified reason and would not break from the underground for half a century untilKing Healthorg the Greaturged the gnomes to do so.[24][25]

At some point in the Fourth Age presumably after the fall of the elven kingdom,Hazeeldominated the Kandarin region and built theCarnillean mansion, and his subjugation would persist through to the current Fifth age.[26]

Some time during the Fourth Age,Mother Mallumof theSea Slugsattempted to conquer Gielinor by first possessing a swath of its important political figures, but was discovered by aWhite Knights-Temple Knightscoalition. She was subsequently subdued when she was forced into the cave inWitchavenand imprisoned there behind a magically-sealed door.[27][28]

Fifth Age[edit|edit source]

At the start of the current age in Year 7,Hazeel's rule was abolished when theCarnillean familystormed his home at night and eradicated its inhabitants, taking the mansion as their own.[29]Incensed by the surging power that humanity began to attain through the rapid and sweeping spread of magic and Runecrafting, the Carnilleans were able to best the Zamorakians using their newfound abilities.[30]

General Khazard, at some point around the start of the Fifth Age or at the end of the Fourth Age, along similar efforts to hisMahjarratsuperior, Hazeel, began to reorganise the human settlements aroundPort Khazardand theFight Arenaand placed them under his control. This would coincide with the false identity and background the inhabitants perceive of him: a dark spirit of a man named Khazard who died 200 years ago, now roaming in the form of an undead maniac general.[31]

In Year 30, theOutpostnorth of Ardougne was constructed as an advance detection system for the city. Ironically, the outpost was abandoned as a result of the absence of any wars that it could have been utilised for. It's not until around Year 94-95 when a band of nine Zamorakians (includingDrozal) occupied the structure as a base-of-operations for their terrorist plots against the local population throughout the succeeding years, known asThe Dreaded Years of Tragedy.[32]

Starting in Year 42, a coalition of Fremennik tribes led byGunnarset off acampaignto rid the continent of the sacrilegious practice of crafting and using runestones— artefacts left by the gods and, thus, ought to be untampered with by mere mortals.[33]As Kandarin is absent of any rune altar entrances, the region likely did not see as much terror as compared toAsgarniaandMisthalin, where the bulk of the rune altar entrances were found. With the certainty that magic users like the Carnilleans were present in the region, it's reasonable to assume they still fell victim to the Fremennik carnage, regardless.

By Year 98, the Ardougnians had caught onto the Outpost Zamorakians' disruptive schemes which they had been conducting for years, but the Ardougne people were incapable of dealing with them directly, due to their inferior magical abilities. Nevertheless, they sought to get rid of their presence entirely, so the Ardougnians enlisted a group of Saradominists to help confront them.[34]Ironically, the Saradominist group to meet their call was led by the once-great friend of the leader of the Zamorakians before they split off in their youth due to their religious convictions.The Great Battleensued and resulted in near total annihilation of both sides, save for those very same leaders and former friends. The two began to lament on the rift driven and the time lost between them, and they came to settle over their differences. They even compromised on their religious dispute and both began following the path ofGuthix.[35]

By Year 101, the two survivors made great strides in Ardougne, where one became king and kicked off the currentArdignas dynastyand the other saw to the creation of theEqual Trade Market— both seeking to promote equality among the people.[36]

In Year 132,King Arthurand hisKnights of the Round Tablecrossed over from the realm ofBritainto Gielinor. In seeking shelter for the time being until their awaited return to their home realm, the then-king of Ardougne,King Ulthas, andLord Sinclairheld a conference to find an accommodation for them. As a result, Lord Sinclair willingly and generously forfeited theCamelotcastle he and his family lived in, and instead would relocate to theSinclair mansionthey had built to compensate.[37][38]King Arthur would rename the castle "Camelot". At some point, other natives of Britain would arrive to Gielinor, such as theLady of the Lake,Morgan Le Faye, andSir Mordred.
