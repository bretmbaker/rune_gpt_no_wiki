Attack speed



7 ticks (4.2 seconds)



Halberds, also referred to by players ashallies, are long two-handedmelee weaponswith blades similar toaxesand handles made up of long poles. All halberds, except thenoxious halberd, have a slowattack speedof 7ticks, the same as2h swords, but they can hit opponents from arangetwo squares away, as opposed to the usual one square distance of most melee weapons. In addition to sharing the attack speed, most halberds have similar strength and slash bonuses to their 2h sword counterparts, falling behind in strength bonus and accuracy while making up for this in increased range and defence bonuses. The exception to this is the white and black halberds, which have significantly lower strength bonuses which equal the steel halberd.

A player may only wield adragon halberdonce they have completed theRegicidequest and thecrystal halberdcan only be wielded after completion of theHard Western Provinces Diary. The other halberds can be worn anytime, so long as you have the rightAttacklevel (and with some the rightStrengthlevel) to wield them.

Halberds can be used in "safespots", or locations where a player can hit a monster and not get hit back, for example across a gate or fence.

Halberds cannot be created with theSmithingskill.
