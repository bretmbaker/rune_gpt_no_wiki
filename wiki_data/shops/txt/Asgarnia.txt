Asgarnian crossroads[edit|edit source]

TheAsgarnian crossroads(unofficial name)is a long, connected path of trails spanning fromRimmingtontoDeath Plateau. The kingdom has two major "finished" paths north and south ofFalador, as well as multiple dirt paths that are connected to its endpoints. The south-east point of the path terminates at the wall betweenDraynor VillageandPort Sarim, where theunderwater tunnel shortcutcan be found.

There are two pubs, ten houses, two docks, seven shops, two mines, two guilds, one farm, two house portals, and one castle officially connected to the path. The path also connects toGoblin VillageandBarbarian Village, while also leading intoDraynor. The path also connects to Falador, with an additional castle, two banks, six shops, eight houses, one pub, and one guild directly connected to the official path, as well as theFalador Parkand theFalador Party Room.

Of the buildings in Asgarnia, eight shops, five houses, fourchurches, one jail, one castle, one tower, and one guild are near, but not directly connected to the official path. In total, this means that 35% of the buildings in Asgarnia (including in Falador) arenotconnected to the official trail.
