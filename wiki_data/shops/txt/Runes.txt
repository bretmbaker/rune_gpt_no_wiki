Obtaining runes[edit|edit source]

Monster drops[edit|edit source]

Many monsters drop runes in RuneScape, but some more than others. These are some of the most notable and easy.

Level 7 and 20Dark wizardssouth ofVarrock, south ofTaverley, and inDraynor VillageWizardsin theWizards' Towersouth ofDraynor VillageElemental mages south ofFaladorChaos druidsinTaverley DungeonandEdgeville DungeonFlesh Crawlersin 2nd floor of theStronghold of SecurityZombie (common)in 2nd floor of the Stronghold of SecurityInfernal Magesin theSlayer TowerHill Giantsin theGiants' Plateau. Note that the giants are level 28, but even novice players can gain runes from them. There’s usually one or two high-level characters fighting the giants. When a one of these players kills a giant, the giant will occasionally drop a rare rune-such as a law, nature, cosmic or death rune. If your character can’t go head-to-head with giants, just activate sprint, grab the rune, and retreat to the entrance of the plateau. The giants won’t follow you past the edge of the plateau, so it’s a good spot to heal in-between rune drops. Bones to bananas is good for this; there’s plenty of bones around, and your character can transmute them directly into bananas.

Runecraft[edit|edit source]

Runecraftis the skill of crafting runes fromrune essence. Through this skill, players can create their own runes for use inMagic.
