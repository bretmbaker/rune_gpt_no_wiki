A selection of Capes of Accomplishment

 | The music that plays when you purchase a Cape of Accomplishment





ACape of Accomplishment(also called askillcape) is a cape that symbolises achieving the highest possible level in a particularskill(level 99), the completion of everyquest(321 QP), everyAchievement Diary, or unlocking all the in-gamemusic. Capes of Accomplishment aremembers' only items.

Capes of Accomplishment cost 99,000coins(same price for the trimmed capes once you have trained two or more skills to 99). Each are obtainable from specificNPCmasters, who can be seen proudly displaying the cape. A temporary skill boost that raises a skill level to 99 will not allow the player to obtain the corresponding cape. The NPC is located in a place related to their skill. Capes also come with matching hoods, although the hoods do not offer any bonuses.

When a player achieves a second level 99 skill, their earlier cape of accomplishment receives a graphical enhancement in the form of a "trim" of a different colour. This trim is irreversible. These so called "trimmed skillcapes" can be used to show that someone has more than one skillcape. TheAchievement diary capewill allow you to trim both theQuest point capeand theMusic cape, although the achievement diary cape can only be trimmed after obtaining the quest point cape. Unlike other Capes of Accomplishment, the aforementioned three capes can be manually trimmed and untrimmed by use of the right click menu.

If a player holding a skillcape dies to another player, and it is not protected on death, 11,880 coins will appear on the floor for the killer.

Skill boost[edit|edit source]

Selecting the "Boost" option in the equipment menu or equipping a cape of accomplishment temporarily boosts the player's effective level in the cape's skill by 1, up to 100. TheHitpointsandPrayer capeshave a 1 minute cool-down period between uses of this effect. Every cape's boost cannot be reactivated until its skill has dropped back to 99. This boost follows the same rules as any other skill boost, lasting up to 60 seconds.

Cape of Accomplishment perks[edit|edit source]

Each cape has certain benefits. For example, theFiremaking capewill act as alight sourceeither when equipped or in inventory, and aswarm clothingforWintertodt, and wearing theCooking capewill prevent any food from being burned. These perks only work on members worlds.

Amax capewill provide all the perks of all skillcapes. However, a max cape may be combined with certain best-in-slot cape slot items, such as theGuthix cape, creating aGuthix max cape. Doing so will cause the max cape to assume the stats of the item it was combined with, forfeiting the max cape perks, making it merely a cosmetic enhancement to the original item. A list of all possible max cape combinations can be foundhere.

If a player displays a certain set of skillcapes on thecape hangerin aplayer-owned houseAchievement Gallery, theperksthat they have will become availableonly to the house owner. The perks of the following skillcapes can be used while displayed on the cape hanger:

Keeping the first Skillcape untrimmed[edit|edit source]

When players get their first Skillcape, it will be untrimmed. The moment the player reaches 99 in another skill, all untrimmed capes currently in possession of the player, banked or stored in their house, orregularly picked up at any timewill becomepermanentlytrimmed, unless some precaution is taken. Players may wish to keep their first Skillcape untrimmed, because they like the look of it or another reason. Owning multiple untrimmed capes may be helpful to avoid losing every untrimmed version.
Some methods to keep the untrimmed Skillcapes from trimming are as follows:Note:These methods need to be repeatedeverytime a new 99 is about to be achieved, or if the untrimmed cape is dropped for any reason, including while not a member.

Telegrabbingthe cape:

Drop the Skillcape on the ground.Reach 99 in another skill.Telegrab the untrimmed Skillcape. It will remain untrimmed.If picked up without telegrab, it will become trimmed upon pickup.

Having the untrimmed cape in a death storage:

Dying to some instanced NPCs transports your items into a death storage, excluding your protected items. Check thedeathpage for more info on protected items.Normal death: Upon dying to an NPC your items will be transported to your grave, excluding your protected items. If the untrimmed cape is moved intoDeath's Office, it will be safe there forever.Hespori:Arnowill hold your items. Requires 65Farmingto plant aHespori seed. He requires 25,000 coins to reclaim the items.These are methods available toSkill pures, as they cannot useMagicto telegrab the cape.Zulrah:Priestess Zul-Gwenwynigwill hold your items. Requires access toZul-Andra.[1]She requires 100,000 coins to reclaim your items after you have killed Zulrah 50 times.Chambers of Xeric: Store your cape in during the raid and leave it there. This is the best temporary method as you can die multiple times outside of the raid and the items in the chest will never disappear unlike the Zulrah or Theatre of Blood chest.[2]Theatre of Blood: The chest outside will hold your items. Requires 100,000 coins to reclaim the items.The following death storageshave not been tested, but are assumed to work similarly:Alchemical Hydra:Orrvor quo Matenwill hold your items. Requires the ability to wear protective footwear — 44Slayerforboots of stone, or 50Defenceforgranite boots—, or a highHitpointslevel and food, in order to not perish walking to the Alchemical Hydra's location. He requires 100,000 coins to reclaim the items.Vorkath:Torfinnwill hold your items. Requires partial completion ofDragon Slayer II, and 100,000 coins to reclaim the items.Reach 99 in another skill.Take the Skillcape out of the death storage.

If theWoodcutting capeis the player's first 99, it can be stored in theclothes pouchof theForestry kit. The cape will not be trimmed, when a second 99 is reached.It is currently unknown if theTackle boxandHuntsman's kitprotect their respective capes from getting trimmed.

Joke Skillcapes[edit|edit source]

While these capes resemble a skillcape and possess a skillcape emote, they are considered a joke and do not qualify as a real Cape of Accomplishment (e.g. for purposes of theFalador Diary).

Changes[edit|edit source]

24 September2015(update) | You can no longer perform skillcape emotes aboard the Fishing Trawler.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

If a player somehow possesses a cape of accomplishment for a skill that they later have the base level reduced, they will be unable to wear it until they achieve 99 again. This was previously possible inDeadman Modeworlds, when death would result in loss of experience[3]before anupdate, and inunrestricted worlds, where the player can freely set their levels.The max cape does not have anoperatefunction, and thus cannot boost any skill.As every cape costs 99,000 coins each, buying all Capes of Accomplishment (Skill Capes, Quest Point Cape, Achievement Diary Cape, and Music Cape) will require 2,574,000 coins, excluding the max cape. With the Max cape included, it would cost 4,851,000 coins for every Cape of Accomplishment.Including the 23 skillcapes, theMax cape, theQuest point cape, theAchievement diary capeand theMusic cape, there are a total of 27 capes of accomplishment.
