Seers' Village

Keldagrimis the city of thedwarves. Its name is derived from theRiver Keldaflowing through the city and it is a massive underground settlement accessible from the tunnel entrance east ofRellekka. It is first visited during theThe Giant Dwarfquest. This is also the home of theBlast Furnaceand theRat Pits. After the completion ofAnother Slice of H.A.M, players can use theDorgesh-Kaan–Keldagrim train systemto travel between the city ofDorgesh-Kaanand Keldagrim.

The city is divided into two parts by the river: the rich West Keldagrim and the poorer East Keldagrim. TheKeldagrim Palacesits in the centre of the city, accessible from both halves. The city was once a monarchy during the so-called Age of Kings, but is currently ruled by aConsortiumof the eight most powerful trading companies.

History[edit|edit source]

Keldagrim was founded millennia ago by a lost clan of magic-using dwarves who'd gone underground to escape theGod Warson the surface.[1][2][3]The history of Keldagrim is thereafter divided into at least three periods, most of which take place in theFourth Age. They include the Era of Kings, the Rise of the Consortium, and the Era of Prosperity, as these eras are supposedly documented in theKeldagrim Library.[3]

The Era of Kings (also known as the Age of Kings), when Keldagrim was ruled by a monarch, began at some point after the city's founding and lasted over 1000 years.[1]Steam power was not fully developed by the dwarves at this time, so it was very difficult for them to acquire enough food to feed the city.[4]Accordingly, this era is referred to as "the dark days".[5]The dwarves had no contact with the surface until the reign ofKing Alvis. After his victory against a troll invasion, the dwarves cautiously reestablished contact.[6]Their relationship to humans was initially hostile. Humans dared not even go underground for fear of dwarven aggression.[7]

The Rise of the Consortium was marked by the end of King Alvis' reign roughly 500 years ago. The king founded the Consortium, an assembly of the city's mining companies, to aid the monarchy, but it ended up supplanting it entirely. By the king's death, the monarchy was effectively abolished.[5]

At some point later, The Era of Prosperity began, which is the current period.[3]

After the Consortium came to power, the steam engine was developed over the next centuries.[8]Keldagrim cannot produce most of its food by itself, so the steam-powered minecart network is instrumental in ensuring the city is properly fed.[9]

Getting there[edit|edit source]

Travelling to Keldagrim requires startingThe Giant Dwarfquest. The quest can be started by talking to thedwarven boatmanjust outside the city, in the cave north-east ofRellekka.
