TheCombat Training Camp(orKing Lathas's training grounds) can be accessed after theBiohazardquest. It was established byKing LathasofEast Ardougneto train his forces, and it is located north-west of East Ardougne (and also south ofTree Gnome Stronghold)—it can be accessed from East Ardougne by heading north, then run west, take the bridge south and run west past theChaos Temple. The entrance to the training grounds is located at the southern fence.

The training camp has several level 63 cagedogres, which can be used for trainingRanged,Magic, andMelee(only when using ahalberd). The cage has aloose railing, which you can use to enter the cage to retrieve drops and spent arrows. Attempting to attack the ogres while inside the cage results in a message saying "These ogres are for ranged combat only".
