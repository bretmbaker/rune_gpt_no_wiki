Cam Torumis an underground city beneathRalos' Rise, accessible after killing thesulphur naguaand then talking toAttalain thePerilous Moonsquest. During and after the quest, players help subdue theMoons of Perilthat are imprisoned under the city inNeypotzli. Attempting to enter the Cam Torum without having the quest's requirements will result in Attala turning the player away.

The city was founded byImcando dwarves[1]descended fromLovakengjrefugees who fledXeric's rule during theAge of Strife.[2][3]Though part ofVarlamoregeographically, Cam Torum appears to be equivalent to an independentcity-state, being governed byHighlord Katlorather thanQueen Zyanyi Arkan. Additionally, they do not appear to refer to themselves as of the Imcando, but rather as the "Dwarves of Cam Torum".[4][5][6]

Despite having an alliance withCivitas illa Fortis, the dwarves prefer to keep to themselves and are not particularly fond of humans, who they perceive as dangerous, arrogant, and short-sighted.[7]As such, authorising humans to enter the city is often an exasperating task.[8][9]

The city had at some point maintained contact with the dwarves ofLovakengjuntil some centuries ago,[10]presumably during theWar of the Five Houses. It is not known whether they had remained in contact with their brethren inCamdozaal, but they appear to be aware of their demise in theRunecrafting Crusades.[11]As such, Cam Torum is the last city on Gielinor with a major population ofImcando-descendants.

TheCam Torum minecontains a variety of ore rocks, notably having a formation ofiron rockssuitable forpower-mining. Uniquely, the mine containscalcified rocks, which yieldblessed bone shardsandcalcified deposits.

Neypotzli[edit|edit source]

Neypotzliis home to the imprisonedMoons of Peril, and is accessed from the northern end of the city. The questPerilous Moonsheavily revolves around it, and serves as an introduction to the city and the prison itself.

Guarded houses[edit|edit source]

In the north-east and north-west corner of the city, there are two houses each manned by two guards. When attempting to enter either house the player will be stopped by a guard. They will explain that the player cannot enter, piquing the players curiosity. The player will guess that a "really large anvil" is being kept secret in the house which prompts the guard to issue a final warning. The player is given options to either leave, or ask if they are hiding a dwarf with a really long beard. Should the player ask about the long-bearded dwarf they will receive 10% current health damage. The guard will then ask the player to ask them again, resulting in a loop unless the player clicks away or selects the "Okay, okay! I'm leaving." option.
