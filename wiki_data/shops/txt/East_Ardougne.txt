East Ardougneis the eastern of the two districts that formArdougne, the capital ofKandarin. It is in the members area ofGielinor.

Its neighbour,West Ardougne, governed byKing Tyras, is closed off to the general public because of a plague affecting the inhabitants, but players may gain access by finishing parts of thePlague Cityquest. East Ardougne is most known for its wealth, zoo and the theft-stricken marketplace. East Ardougne is currently governed byKing Lathas.

History[edit|edit source]

Not much is known about the history of East Ardougne andWest Ardougne, but we do know about theBattle of Ardougne. It started with the warlord andMahjarrat,Hazeelcoming back from rebelling againstZarosand becoming the warlord and leader of most ofKandarinand the Ardougne area. He stayed as leader of the area until later when he was challenged and fought bySir Ceril Carnillean's distant ancestor. He was then though defeated and slain by the ancestor. This ancestor later built his mansion overHazeel's grave in East Ardougne. After all this, the city grew and became a very wealthy city inGielinor. Millennia later, you can side with Hazeel and resurrect him in theHazeel Cultquest. But, you can also help the Carnilleans and fight against them (you can't fight any of them in the quest except a level 13). This is about all that is known about the history of the city of Ardougne and theKingdom of Kandarin.King Ulthasoriginally ruled Ardougne, but when he died, his sons,LathasandTyras, split the city in half.

Other things that happened in the overall city of Ardougne was when the plague struck West Ardougne. It is said to have come from when King Tyras last visited his city, before he left again to go back to explore the elf lands ofTirannwn.
