There are fouryew trees() north-west of thegeneral store. BehindBrian's andRommik's stores are dozens ofwillow trees, and there are also someoak treesto the east of the village. Because the nearestbankis quite far away, the trees are not popular for training, but the area may be used as a place to level upFiremakingby cutting a fullinventoryof logs and subsequently burning them. However, there is no space to burn a full inventory of logs in a straight line, hampering training efficiency.TheRimmington minenorth-east of the village containstin,clay,iron,copper, and twogold rocks.There is a bushfarming patchnorth-west of the village.
