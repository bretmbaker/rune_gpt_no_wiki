History[edit|edit source]

Little is known about Burgh de Rott's history, but it can presumably be dated back to the time aroundHallowvalein the earlyThird Age, asQueen Efaritay, the Queen of Hallowland's name, can still be found. Whether it was abandoned or destroyed duringLowerniel Drakanand hisvampyres' invasion is unknown.

In recent times the town has become a place for human refugees, who have escaped from the vampyres' tyranny. The town is in ruins and the vampyres assume it is uninhabited and thus never go there. DuringIn Aid of the Myreque, theplayerhelps fix up some of the essential parts of the town, improving the living conditions for the residents. The fact that the town is populated was discovered byGadderanks, who, accompanied by twoVampyre Juvinates, came to tithe the population. The player, however, managed to defeat Gadderanks and the vampyres, meaning that Burgh de Rott is safe for now.
