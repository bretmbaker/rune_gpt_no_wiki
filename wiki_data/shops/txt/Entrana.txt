The holy island ofEntranalies south-west ofTaverley. When entering Entrana, adventurers are prohibited from bringingweaponsorarmourwith them.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

Access is via:

Boat inPort Sarim, by talking to themonkson the dock. This is free.Through theLaw Altarvia theAbyssin theWilderness.Using theBalloon transport system.

Taking a boat from Port Sarim to Entrana is a task in theFalador Easy Diary.

Prohibited equipment[edit|edit source]

Before being able to sail or fly to Entrana, themonkor aBalloon transport systemassistant will search the player. At thelaw rift, the power of Saradomin is present and will prevent the player from taking prohibited equipment to Entrana. If a player logs in on Entrana or exits theLaw Altarwith prohibited equipment (via exploitation ofglitches), amonkwill immediately appear next to the player on Entrana and knock them unconscious (with a few exceptions). The player will then reawaken inPort Sarimaboard the Entrana ferry, and exclaimUrrrrrgh!

Despite Entrana's east coast being within line of sight for usingTelekinetic Grabon items on the coast just west ofFalador, trying to cast the spell on items dropped there will result in a chat message sayingI can't reach that..

Generally, players cannot take any of the following:

Playerscannotsmuggle weapons or armour to Entrana by openingTreasure Trailscaskets there, as they cannot be received on the island; if a slot in the reward casket loot table rolls a prohibited item, it is rerolled[1]. This makes it useful for players seeking specific rewards such as god pages. However,beginnerandmastercaskets may not be opened on the island; if attempted, a message states that the monks are watching closely.

Certain items can be crafted on the island with the appropriateCraftingand/orFletchinglevels. However, the player shouldonlydo this in their current session; if they log off and back on after having created a weapon, the monk will spot the player and remove them from the premises immediately.

In theTrailblazer Leaguegame mode, players could smuggleblackandblessedbracers, chaps and body armour to Entrana without objection from a passing monk by exiting theLaw Altar, without having to craft a set of black dragonhide armour. This requiredcrystal of memoriesto return to the Law Altar with armour. It is unclear whether this works inDeadman Modewithsigil of last recall.

Implings caught in jars could be smuggled via the Law Altar with a crystal of memories to Entrana, but jars with prohibited equipment cannot be opened on the main island, attempting to yields the message:You can't loot impling jars here.However, they can be looted inside the Law Altar despite the power of Saradomin prohibiting taking prohibited implings caught in jars through thelaw rift. It is unclear whether impling jars can be smuggled with a sigil of last recall.

In theTrailblazer Reloaded League, players with thebanker's notecould use it to un-note noted armour and weapons on the island. This was useful for completing clue steps that would otherwise have required players to craft the required items on Entrana.
