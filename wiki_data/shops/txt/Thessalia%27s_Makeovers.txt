Thessalia's Makeoverswas a shop inVarrockthat could change aplayer's default clothing free of charge. The makeover was run byThessalia, who also ownsanother clothing shopin the same building. Players could not customise shoes here — they must have instead gone toYrsa's Shoe Store. There was no fee attached to the service, neither for the tops or for the legwear, allowing players to customise their default outfit as often as they like.

To get a makeover, talk to Thessalia and ask for one, or right-click her and choose "Makeover". Equipmentcanbe worn while getting a makeover, but a player will not be able to see the changes afterwards until they remove anything in the torso or leg slots.

The shop has since been superseded by themakeoverinterface, also offered by Thessalia.
