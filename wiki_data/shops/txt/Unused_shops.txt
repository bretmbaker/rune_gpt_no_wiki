[Shop: Unused_shops]

 | This article contains information about a subject known only to exist in the game APIs or cache.The content is not known to be accessible in game, or may be reserved for use in a future update.

Unused shopsareShopsthat, although existing in the game config, cannot be found anywhere ingame. These shops are primarily unused duplicates of existing shops, but some were previously accessible before being removed, while others were never released ingame.

Food shop[edit|edit source]

The "Food shop" is identical to theFood storerun byWydininPort Sarim, except with two differences. This shop does not sell anyraw chicken, whilechocolate barsrestock 3 seconds faster than normal. It is possible that the shop was created when deciding to replace the original raw chicken in the shop with raw beef, before ultimately deciding the shop would stock both.

The Shrimp and Parrot[edit|edit source]

This is the original version ofThe Shrimp and Parrotthat can be found inBrimhaven. Upon the release ofTai Bwo Wannai Trio, the shop was updated to sellCooked Karambwan. Rather than update the shop, a new version was created that took its place; the original shop has remained unused and inaccessible ever since.

Gem shop 3[edit|edit source]

Presumably an unused copy of theArdougne Gem Stallrun by theGem merchantinEast Ardougne. It is unknown exactly what the shop would have sold, and it has since been deleted from the game files.

Spice shop[edit|edit source]

An unused copy of theArdougne Spice Stallrun by theSpice sellerinEast Ardougne. Unlike the real spice stall, it was never updated to sell aknifeorgarlic.

Silver stall[edit|edit source]

Presumably an unused copy of theArdougne Silver Stallrun by theSilver merchantinEast Ardougne. It is unknown exactly what the shop would have sold, and it has since been deleted from the game files.

Fur stall[edit|edit source]

An unused copy of theArdougne Fur Stallrun by theFur traderinEast Ardougne. The shop differs from the real fur stall, in that it has not been updated to buy the various furs that can be obtained fromHunter.

Item | Numberin stock | Restocktime | Pricesold at | Pricebought at | GEprice

 | Bear fur | 3 | 1m  (100t) | 12 | 9 | 147

Port Phasmatys General Store[edit|edit source]

This shop is almost identical to the realPort Phasmatys General Storebut has some differences. The shop only sells 3potsand 2buckets, as opposed to the 100 of each sold by the real shop; they also have much slower restock time. Similarly,jugsare the second item sold as opposed to buckets.

Curiously, although the shop has never been accessible by players, it was updated in 2016 and 2018 to stockEmpty jug packsandEmpty bucket packs.

The shop was most likely removed as the replacement shop allowed for much easier use of theEctofuntus, by selling much greater quantities of pots and buckets and listing them both first.

TzHaar General Store[edit|edit source]

Presumably this would have been a genericGeneral storethat could be found in theTzHaar City. The character ofTzHaar-Hur-Kozwas added to the game as its shopkeeper. For unknown reasons however, the shop was never made available to players, and TzHaar-Hur-Koz was ultimately deleted from the game files on 2 April 2007.

The exact stock of the shop is unknown.

Dargaud's Bow and Arrows.[edit|edit source]

This version ofDargaud's Bow and Arrowswas released on 18 October 2006, with theBow and Arrow salesmanselling the newFletching cape. However, as theRanging Guildrequires 40 Ranged to enter, this led to player complaints that skill pures would never be able to buy the cape. As a result, the shop was removed 5 days later, andHickton's Archery EmporiuminCatherbynow sells the cape instead.

Presumably due to an oversight, the shop was named "Aaron's Archery Appendages." ingame.
