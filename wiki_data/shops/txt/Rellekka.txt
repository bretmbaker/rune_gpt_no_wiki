Sinclair Mansion

Rellekkais the largest city of theFremennik Province, home to theFremenniks. All of its features can only be used by players who have completedThe Fremennik Trials, with the exception of milking theDairy cowor using theDairy churn.

Built against the sea, Rellekka, when coupled with the rest of the Fremennik Province, is a good place to train a variety of skills. Its large port allows for quick access to the many islands of theLunar Sea, and the dwarven capital ofKeldagrimis located nearby to the east. Rellekka's close proximity to areas, such as theBrine Rat Cavern, theSlayer Dungeon, and theTrollweiss hunter area, makes it very popular amongst some players. For higher level players, ships in the port provide access to dangerous but lucrative monsters such asBasilisk Knights, theDagannoth Kings, andVorkath. Rellekka is used by some players on such a regular basis that they build theirhousesjust outside the city.

Transportation[edit|edit source]

Rellekka's remote location makes it a very tedious city to access. There are a large variety of ways to reach Rellekka, some more effective than others. The following are roughly ordered by how quick they are:

Players who have completed parts of theFremennik Diarymay useFremennik sea bootsto teleport to Rellekka, in the middle of the market. Easy, medium and hard diaries grant one daily teleport, while the elite tier grants unlimited teleports.When charged, theenchanted lyre, which is acquired duringThe Fremennik Trialsquest, will teleport the player to Rellekka's entrance.APlayer-owned houseportal is located just outside the village gates, and, when teleported to, puts players right next to the city. To use this portal, a player must have 30Construction.By using theScroll of redirectionacquired fromNightmare Zone, one can create aRellekka teleportwhich is a magic tablet that can be broken by players to teleport just outside the Rellekka house portal. It can be created at level 30 Construction by using a scroll of redirection on a teleport to house tablet.If the player has unlockedLunar spells, theMoonclan TeleportandWaterbirth Teleporttransport them to islands only a short boat ride away from Rellekka. In particular, if one teleports to Lunar Isle, they need only talk to one of theNPCsin the area without aSeal of passageto be instantly kicked out to the Rellekka marketplace.With theelite Fremennik Diarycompleted, theReturn Orbin Lunar Isle's bank can be used instead of talking to one of the NPCs in order to sent to Rellekka.Use any player's player-owned houseportal chamberwith a portal directed at Waterbirth Island orLunar Isle.At 83Farming, players can plant aSpirit treeonEtceteria, which (with 55Agility) is only a quick boat ride away from Rellekka.Players can use aring of wealthto teleport to Miscellania and take a short boat ride after completion of theThrone of Miscellaniaquest.There are fiveFairy ringsin the area: one onMiscellania(CIP) (fastest), one nearSinclair Mansion(CJR) (fastest without any quests requirements, but requires 48Agility), one near theFremennik Slayer Dungeon(AJR) (fastest without requirements), and one nearKeldagrim(DKS) that is close to the hunting area and rock crabs. Using fairy rings requires at least partial completion ofFairytale II - Cure a Queen.After completion of theEagles' Peakquest, players can use theEagle transport systemto access the nearby icy hunter area from several locations.The nearby dwarven city,Keldagrim, also hosts several transportation options that can be somewhat helpful in reaching the city. The city'smine cart networkallows players to travel from Keldagrim toWhite Wolf Mountainand theDwarven Mine, and vice versa. When paired with the house portal inTaverley, this can be very quick. TheDorgesh-Kaan–Keldagrim train systemalso allows players to travel to and from Keldagrim andDorgesh-Kaanfor free, provided they have completedAnother Slice of H.A.M.At 45Magic, UseCamelot Teleport(or set the destination toSeers' Villageafter completion of the hard tier of theKandarin diary) and walk north. Follow the pathway west away fromSinclair Mansion, cross the bridge, and continue north to the gates of Rellekka.One can use agames necklaceto teleport to theBarbarian Outpost, and, from there, walk northward to Rellekka. You must startHorror from the Deepand at least partially fix the bridge to use this route. Alternatively, the Lunar spellBarbarian Teleportalso can be used to teleport to the Barbarian Outpost. A third option is a minigame teleport, assuming you've done (or skipped) the tutorial.

Notable features[edit|edit source]

Marketplace[edit|edit source]

The marketplace is perhaps the most important part of Rellekka. It is a well-known thieving spot and is frequently visited by hunters and fishermen.

In the marketplace are manythievingspots, including threefish stallsand twofur stalls. There is also a Fremennik wandering around that can be pickpocketed. It is not so easy to steal from the stalls, though, as they are heavily guarded by Rellekka'smarket guards. Also,Sigmund the Merchantsells a variety of goods in a general store-like shop, which many do not know about, as it is not shown on the world map.

The mine north-east of the longhall contains severalclay rocks. By using the well and pottery features west of the marketplace, it is possible to craft any clay item within Rellekka. If you build yourhousethere, you can also crafttele-tabletshere.

For those not interested in pottery, it is also possible to craft glass without ever leaving the area. Bybig netfishing, it is possible to gatherseaweed. Even faster, though, is the method, which involves the north-eastern beach. North-east of the village is a large beach swarming withrock crabs(which drop seaweed), as well as many seaweed respawns.

To the north-east of the Main Hall of Rellekka, there is aminingarea containing sevencoal, fourclay, and threesilver rocksthough this spot is not recommended due to the lack of a nearby bank. However, there is afurnaceand ananviljust on the other side of town, in the south-west corner. When paired with the expansivemineonJatizso, this area can be used effectively. Accessing the mining area requires completion of theFremennik Trialsquest.
