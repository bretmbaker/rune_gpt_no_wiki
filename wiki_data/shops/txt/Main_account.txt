[Shop: Main_account]

The termmainusually refers to aplayer's account that is situated on the main game mode.

This term is usually used by players who have multiple accounts, most commonly referred to as "alts" (short for alternates). These accounts are usually disposable and in essence, they are technically 'pures', as they are created and trained for multiple purpose(s), such asmoney makingand typically, only a specific set of skill(s) are focused on and trained for any gain to the player (usually monetary).

In the context ofPvP, it refers to an account that doesn't have any particular stat restrictions, often with max combat stats. These accounts have the benefit of being able to use equipment that pures can't, such asDharok the Wretched's equipmentand thehelm of Neitiznot.

Although it used to be forbidden to log into more than one account simultaneously, this was changed in May 2014,[1][2]allowing trade and other interaction between alternate accounts.

In the context ofPvPcombat andaccount builds,"Main"is referring to an account which is on the main game mode as opposed to "Iron" which is referring to an account which is playing the Iron man game mode and has Iron man restrictions. The term "Alt" is also used by players who have a separate account, usually on the Main Game Mode, that is not necessarily used as a primary account to play on and typically used for either money making, getting around GE limits and scouting pvp areas.
