Map



Mor Ul Rek, also known as theTzHaar City,is a city located underneath thevolcanoonKaramja. It is inhabited by theTzHaar, a race of golem-like volcanic creatures. It is home to multiple combat-focusedminigames, and uses the currency ofTokkul. Having afire capeorfire max capeis required to enter the interior portion of the city.

In theTzHaar language, the wordsmor,ul, andrekare translated as old/retired, circle/ring and young/youth respectively.

History[edit|edit source]

Mor Ul Rek was founded by the TzHaar people. The TzHaar led an isolated life with four castes; the Ket, Xil, Mej and Hur castes. The TzHaar-Ket patrol the city to protect its inhabitants from any dangers. The TzHaar-Xil hunt volcanic animals to feed their society. The TzHaar-Mej work as advisors, while a few also act as leaders. The TzHaar-Hur craft various items and equipment.

The TzHaar were eventually discovered byhumans, who immediately began to establish diplomatic ties with them. The TzHaar are cautious of the humans, dubbed JalYt, as the rest of their city is closed off while the TzHaar decide if the JalYt can be trusted to enter. To prove their trustworthiness, the JalYt may enter the bigger portion of the city if they show the TzHaar guards theirfire cape, obtained from defeatingTzTok-Jad. After passing the barrier once, one does not need to bring the fire cape anymore to pass the barrier.

Mor Ul Rek had a very large incubation chamber (this is most likely why it was closed off). Following TzHaar biology as they gain memories of their ancestors while in the lava, the TzHaar realised that the deeper theeggwas placed in the lava, the more memories they would absorb. They continued to repeat this process to gain ancient knowledge, though they eventually drained the chamber of all lava and discovered an ancient incubation chamber inside. The TzHaar decided to place eggs in there, but it was a grave mistake; the hatched eggs became feral monsters (referred to as Jal) who fought each other for dominance. An ancient being sealed inside the chamber,TzKal-Zuk, eventually took control of the Jal, and the TzHaar offered it sacrifices to appease it, fearing that it would attempt to surface. These feral TzHaar are very intimidating and much more powerful than their current counterparts; even the stronger TzHaar-Ket are hesitant to challenge them.

The TzHaar, wary of JalYt interference, refuse to let players enter the Inferno until they give up a fire cape.
