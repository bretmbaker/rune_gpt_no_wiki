Prices are based on value and are typically around High Alchemy value.Overstocked stores- A store will offer less money to buy items, the higher the current stock of that item in the store is. Whenever a store's stock is high enough that the price of an item has depreciated down to a value of⌊0.1×Value⌋, the item's price will not depreciate any further. This means items will always be bought by stores that accept the item for at least a tenth of the item's value, rounded down.

Miscellaneous[edit|edit source]

Items Kept on DeathValue- Nearly alluntradeable itemsuse their value as their Items Kept on Death Value. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. One example isVesta's blighted longsword, which has an Items Kept on Death value of 50,000,000 coins (the amount used to make the sword useable) instead of 800,000 coins.

Valuecan also be interpreted as the summation of the High and Low Alchemy coin return of any particular item (0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0), although due to flooring this may be slightly lower than the real value.
