Jiggigis a place where deadOgreswere buried until they started to come back to life asundead,ZogreandSkogre. Ogres built abarricadeto stop these undeads from escaping. Jiggig can only be entered during and after theZogre Flesh Eatersquest. According toGrish, it is named Jiggig as it's where Ogres jig.
