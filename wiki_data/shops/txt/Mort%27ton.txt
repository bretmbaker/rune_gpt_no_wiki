History[edit|edit source]

Mort'ton was once a quiet market town that specialised in death. By using the natural caves underneath the town as tombs, Mort'ton became known for specializing in cremations withpyre logs. The town, much like others in Morytania, were later subjugated by thevampyresand likely paid blood tithes. Unfortunately, a strange mist sent from theSanguinesti regionplagued the villagers of Mort'ton, turning them intoafflicted. Despite the attempts ofHerbi Flaxand her assistantLiornish Stemplehair, they were unable to find a permanent cure and succumbed to its infection.

The same mist also caused the remains underneath the catacombs to reanimate, though onlyLoar Shades- the weakest of the six types, were found roaming the village grounds. The other five -Phrin,Riyl,Asyn,FiyrandUrium Shades, remain in the catacombs where they were interred. The shades have not been seen in the surrounding area, indicating that they were limited to the town's nearby vicinity.

The vampyres, unaware of the plague, revisited the village to obtain blood tithes. The vampyre nobleMalakconsumed some of the blood collected from the town, but became ill as a result. The vampyres then decided to stop taking tithes from the village.

During year 169 of theFifth Age, an adventurer stumbled upon the ruins of Mort'ton and discovered Herbi's diary. By using aserum 207on two prominent inhabitants,Ulsquire ShauncyandRazmire Keelgan, they were able to discover how to cremate the shade remains and learned where the shades' burial place was. The adventurer later perfected aserum 208, thus allowing Ulsquire and Razmire to be permanently cured of the plague.
