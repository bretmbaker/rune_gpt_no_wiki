Favour (historical)[edit|edit source]

Prior toan updateon10 January2024,favourwas a core mechanic of each city onKourend. Historical information about how favour was gained and its benefits are documented below.

Gaining favour[edit|edit source]

Players can gain favour with Shayzien by assisting them in various activities in theShayzien Encampment. Earning Shayzien favour will allow players to fightlizardmen,tackle organised crimein the kingdom to help keep order, and earn tiers 1-5Shayzien armourthrough theCombat Ringas the player earns more favour.

To progress in theArchitectural Allianceminiquest, players must gain 100% Shayzien favour and speak toShayda, who is found south of theShayzien Administrationbuilding in the centre of Shayzien.

Wounded soldierscan be found in theInfirmarywithin theShayzien Encampment. In order to heal the soldiers, players must useShayzien medpackson them, which are found in medpack boxes by each tent in the Infirmary. To speed up the process, a player can right-click a medpack box to "Take-many" which instantly fills the player's empty inventory spaces with Shayzien medpacks. Players can rotate clockwise healing soldiers, as by the time players heals the last soldier, the first soldier healed will need healing once more.

Players are given 0.2% favour for every healed soldier; thus 500 soldiers must be healed if choosing this way to gain 100% favour. It is the only method to gain Shayzien favour without engaging in any combat. It will take less than 2 hours to get 100% favour, which is a pretty fast method.

Once players have 5% favour, they are able to killlizardmenand theirbrutecounterparts in the easternLizardman Canyonto gain 0.1% Shayzien favour per kill. Lizardmen in the western swamp area do not count; you must kill them in the area marked on map with a brown star. Lizardmen arepoisonous, so a way to cure poison is advised when killing them. The western half of the eastern section is amulticombat area, meaning adwarven multicannonorburst spellscan be used to earn favour quickly.

The western canyon, containing 3lizardman shamansand only a few lizardmen, isonlyaccessible to players with 100% Shayzien favour.

Lizardmen have a 1/250 chance of dropping aXeric's talisman(this is increased to a 1/125 chance with completion of theeasy Kourend & Kebos Diary). This talisman can be charged withfangsthey drop to teleport aroundGreat Kourend. Players can check lizardmen kill count by talking to soldiers in the canyon.

Lizardmen commonly dropXerician fabric, which will fill the player's inventory quickly, especially if using a cannon. Players with at least level 14Craftingwho wish to do some Crafting training alongside gaining favour are recommended to take a needle & thread to craft fabrics intoXerician robes.

One of the requirements for theTale of the Righteousquest is having 20% Shayzien favour. Besides favour, this quest requires completion ofClient of Kourend, level 16Strength, and 10Mining.

Completion of the quest will grant aShayzien favour certificateworth 10% favour.

Players can helpCaptain Gineaeast of theWar Tentintackling organised crime, where they gain information on where gang meetings are taking place, and taking out the gangsters.

Every 30 minutes, a notice appears on the wall in Captain Ginea's tent. The notice gives the location of an organised crime meeting. After reading the notice, players are prompted to takea noteto remind players of the location (this is not needed in order to gain favour). The meeting lasts for five minutes.

Once the player obtains 60% Shayzien favour, the player can challenge soldiers wandering around theCombat Ringin battle. The only rules when fighting them are thatMagicandRangedcombat cannot be used during the battle.

The player must start from thetier-1 soldierand can rise up to challengetier-5 soldiersin battle. Upon defeat, the soldiers will drop one part of theirarmouras a reward for the player. To challenge the higher ranked soldiers, playersmusthave a full set of armour that is of their tier, or at minimum one rank lower than theirs. The items do not have to be in a player's inventory. Without it, the talked-to soldier will redirect them to the lower ranked soldiers.

The player will gain favour at a 0.4% for tier 1, 0.6% for tier 2, 0.8% for tier 3, and 1% for tier 4 soldiers. Tier 5 soldiers give no favour as they require 100% favour to defeat.

General tips and additional information[edit|edit source]

ADwarf multicannonagainstlizardmenandgangsterscan speed up kills.Earning 100% favour will take players roughly between one and two hours if healing soldiers, killing lizardmen with a cannon until reaching 86%, and winningShayzien armourfor the remaining 14%.While waiting for gang meetings, it is strongly suggested to do some favours like healing,Combat Ring, or lizardmen. Also, using a timer helps. It is possible to world-hop to speed up this process, making the climb from 40% to 100% favour incredibly fast.If killinglizardmenfor favour, it may be worth completing theEasy Kourend & Kebos Diaryfirst because it doubles the drop chance for aXeric's Talisman.If you are at a gang location during tackling organised crime, you can hop worlds to kill another series of gang members.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Shayzien was named after Mod Reach's beloved cat, Shay, who was "a fucking warrior" for going through a difficult surgery, and associating it with Asian warriors such as samurai.[2]A tribute to Shay - theCat Shrine- can be found upstairs in a house within the city.

QR code easter egg[edit|edit source]

Throughout the Shayzien area, there are four out-of-place mysterious tiles found in less-travelled areas of Shayzien.

Locations

Shayzia Ruin | West of the Chasm of Fire | Southern end of Shayziens' Wall | South of Xeric's Lookout

Tile

 |  |  | 

These are in fact four parts of a QR code that must be assembled together through image editing software, merging the dark parts together and colouring the tiles white. If assembled correctly, the resulting image can be scanned using a code scanner app on a phone or website.

Scanning the code will result in the output "@OldpackAvailers", which is a Twitter handle with the name "Archibald Paldock", the name of theOdd Old Man. These tiles were originally added into the game files withFossil Islandin 2017, but were never visible outside of datamining software; the Odd Old Man plays a role inBone Voyage, which is required to reach Fossil Island. In addition, "OldpackAvailers" is an anagram for "Paldock Silvarea" (Silvareais a winding mountain pass north-east ofVarrock.)

The only tweet from the account, dated 4 January 2019 (the 18th anniversary ofRuneScape), is as follows:

“ | 0000 1 1 0110 111000 10010 10010 1000 00 1 010101 0100 1011 10010 0110 01 0100 100 111 1010 101 | ”

 | — @OldpackAvailers

The tweet in actuality is disguised as Morse code, which is known to be featured in a number of easter eggs implemented byMod West. To convert it, the zeros are to be substituted with periods, and ones substituted with dashes, as seen below.

“ | .... - - .--. ---... -..-. -..-. -... .. - .-.-.- .-.. -.-- -..-. .--. .- .-.. -.. --- -.-. -.- | ”

Converting the Morse code text will result in the output http://bit.ly/paldock, a shortened link fromBitly, a URL shortening service. When the link is accessed, it redirects players to a YouTube video of Rick Astley's hit song,Never Gonna Give You Up. Such an act is known asRickrolling, a famous Internet prank.
