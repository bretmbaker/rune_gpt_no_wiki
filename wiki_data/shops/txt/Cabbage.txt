Acabbageis afooditem that can be picked from fields aroundGielinoror grown through theFarmingskillat level 7 withcabbage seeds. They heal 1hitpointwhen eaten. When picking cabbages from fields,membersmay randomly receive 1 cabbage seed.

When eaten, the messageYou eat the cabbage. Yuck!is displayed. When eaten while below full health, the messageIt heals some health anyway.is shown as well.

They are used in the following recipes:

Vegetable batta(Gnome cooking)Garden pie(temporarily boostsFarming level by 3)

Cabbages are purchasable from various stores for1coineach.Hudoat theGrand Treehas a stock of 10;Cobado's Groceriesa stock of 10;Miscellanian Food Shopa stock of 5; andWydininPort Sarima stock of 3, to name a few. ThecookatBlue Moon Innsells unlimited cabbages through his chat dialogue.

Members can store up to 10 cabbages in anempty sack, creating asack of cabbages. Sacks of cabbages are needed to protect growingtomatoes(x2),Krandorian hops(x3), andredberry bushes(x4). Adding cabbages to acompost binmakes regularcompost.

Despite looking similar to regular cabbages,Draynor Manor cabbagesare not the same item and often cannot be used in place of cabbages. TheDraynor Manorvariant plays a role in theBlack Knights' Fortressquest.

If cabbages are brought toLunderwinat theZanarismarketplace, they can be sold for100 coinseach (they must be unnoted). As part of a security measure,sacks of cabbagescannot be taken to the marketplace.
