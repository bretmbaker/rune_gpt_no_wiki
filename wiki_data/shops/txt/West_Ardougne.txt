West Ardougneis amembers-only city and part of the capital ofKandarin. It is only available to players who have partially completed thePlague Cityquest. It has been badly stricken by a mysteriousplaguewhich has been claimed to have been brought into the city on its king's last visit. The plague is later revealed to be a hoax, created byKing Lathasworking with theIorwerth Clanto weaken his brother's control over the city and to use the citizens as slaves to excavate the tunnels leading to theTemple of Light. Its neighbouring city,East Ardougne, is an opposite, being one of the wealthiest cities in Gielinor. West Ardougne was ruled byKing Tyras, although he left the city just before the "plague" struck to adventure the forests ofTirannwn. The city is ruled byKing Thorosafter the events ofSong of the Elves.

In addition to the plague, West Ardougne is also known for containing the entrance to theUnderground Pass.
