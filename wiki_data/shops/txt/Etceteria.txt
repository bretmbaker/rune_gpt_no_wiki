Waterbirth Island

Etceteriais an island kingdom in theLunar Sea, north-west off the coast of theFremennik Province. It lies directly east of the kingdom ofMiscellania.

The island kingdom is ruled byQueen Sigrid, who was at war withKing Vargasof the Kingdom of Miscellania for 100 years prior to the player intervening in their politics. After the events ofThrone of Miscellania, peace was established between the two monarchs. Immediately after, tensions rose again primarily due to the meddling ofFremennikkids, which were found out about and resolved by the player during the events ofRoyal Trouble.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The name "Etceteria" is a play on the phrase "et cetera".The dungeon entrance prevents players from walking around the outside of the castle along its eastern wall. Players who are walking from the north can bypass this by entering the dungeon and immediately leaving it, as they will reappear south of the entrance. Players wishing to walk in the other direction cannot use this trick as exiting the dungeonalwaysplaces the player on the south side of the entrance.
