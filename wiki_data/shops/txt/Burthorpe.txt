Speaking to any member of the Imperial Guard except for major NPCs, (essentially any attackable Soldier), results in "jargon", which is actually a statement in the Latin language. A few of these statements and their English translations are given below, and a more extensive list of these Latin statements and their English translations can be found on the NPC page for theattackable soldiers."Te audire non possume. Musa sapientum fixa est in aure"- "I can't hear you. I have a banana stuck in my ear.""Noli me covare, ego te vocabo"- "I don't want you to call me, I'll call you.""Quantum materiae materietur marmota monax si marmota monax materiam possit materiari?"- "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?""Fac ut gaudeam"- "Make me happy."
