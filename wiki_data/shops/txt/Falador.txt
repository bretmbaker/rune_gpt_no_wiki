Trivia[edit|edit source]

Though never mentioned directly in game,Guthixdescribes 'Farradorn' as a historical place name inissue #25ofGod letters, a likely reference to Falador.[1]Despite the citizens of Falador being strongSaradominists, noaltarsto Saradomin can be found in Falador. There is still an altar usable within the city in the 2nd basement of theOld School Museumbeneath theFalador Party Room.One of Falador's most recognisable features is the sterling white walls. The walls were actually normal grey stone back inRuneScape Classicand the early days ofRuneScape 2.Falador was already mentioned in the original, hand-drawn map of DeviousMUD,RuneScape's first test version. The city was located right next to a volcano.The fence outside the north-west exterior wall has not been graphically updated since its release duringRuneScape Classic.
