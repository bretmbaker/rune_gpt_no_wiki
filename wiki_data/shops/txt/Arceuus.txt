Arceuus(pronounced/ɑːrˈkeɪʊs/arr-KAY-us) is one of the five cities in the Kingdom ofGreat Kourend. Led byLord Trobin Arceuusof the Arceuus House, the city is inhabited byCitizens of Arceuus, immortal beings who commit themselves to studying magic through theDark Altar, a mysterious altar whose powers extend to life and death, expanding theirMagicabilities andproducing runesfor the region.

A majority of those who reside in Arceuus are former humans who, through the power of the Dark Altar, are able to achieve immortality by moving their soul from their mortal body into an incorporeal one. Their souls are freed from the mortal bodies in the crypt below the church, and take on the incorporeal form commonly seen among Arceuus residents.

The art of runecrafting has been known by the Arceuus since at least 150 years before the wave of visitors from the mainland arrived. However, they were unable to createlaw runes, explaining the lack of teleportation spells, save for those used byXeric.

However, a book titledTransvergence Theorydocuments the differences between runecrafting in the mainland and runecrafting in Arceuus. While the mainland uses talismans to teleport individuals to another dimension, runecrafters in Arceuus use energy that emanates from the ground near the Dark Altar to change the essence.

Arceuus is closest to theNorthern Tundrasof Great Kourend, and is the first line of defence against theWintertodt, a mysterious entity that brings along with it extremely harsh cold.

Favour (historical)[edit|edit source]

Prior toan updateon10 January2024,favourwas a core mechanic of each city onKourend. Historical information about gaining favour and its benefits are documented below.

Gaining favour[edit|edit source]

Earning the favour of the Arceuus can be done by assisting Arceuus residents with expanding their knowledge, miningdense essence blocksand using theArceuus spellbookto reanimate creatures. Once earning 100% Arceuus favour, players are able to runecraftbloodandsoul runesat their respectivealtarsif players have level 77 and 90Runecraftrespectively.

To progress in theArchitectural Allianceminiquest, players must gain 100% Arceuus favour and speak toArcis, who is found in the building slightly north-east of the bank.

Because of theArceuus Library's unhelpful librarian,Logosia, customers in the library are having trouble finding the texts they seek. Players can speak toSam,Professor GrackleboneorVilliato search bookcases for books or scrolls around the library for them. To help narrow down where to search, talk toBiblia, the assistant librarian found at the top floor of the library. She wanders around the northern parts of the library.

Note that if a player is required to find either of the booksTransportation IncantationsorSoul journey,it is recommended to read them, as doing so will unlock theKourend Castle Teleportspell and start theBear Your Soulminiquest respectively.

Once the text is found and returned to the respective NPC, players are rewarded with abook of arcane knowledgeand 2.5% favour. Speak to another NPC looking for assistance, as the NPC you already helped will be busy reading the book/scroll you gave them.

Once players reach 20% favour, they can speak toMoriin the centre of Arceuus to start theThe Ascent of Arceuusquest. This quest requires completion ofClient of Kourendand level 12 Hunter. Completion of the quest will grant anArceuus favour certificateworth 10% favour.

At 60% favour, you gain the ability to use the Arceuus spells, and reanimateensouled headsat the dark altar. Doing so will grant between 0.5% and 1.5% favour per head killed, depending on the head, and is an efficient way of gaining favour while training Prayer and Magic.

Once players reach 20% favour, they can speak toHorphis, an Arceuus wizard, who will ask players to collectdark manuscriptsfound within the library. Players can again speak toBibliato narrow down the location of the dark manuscripts and the books.

Unlike the books, multiple manuscripts can be obtained without constantly returning to Horphis. Each manuscript given rewards abook of arcane knowledgeand 5% favour.

Once players reach 25% favour, they will be able to minedense essence blockswithin thedense runestone mine, located east of theDark Altar. Make sure you bring achiselas well as a pickaxe and have level 38 in crafting and mining.

Players can turn in dense essence blocks toClerris, rewarding 0.1% favour for every block handed in. This isnotrecommended to gain favour, as it is extremely slow compared to assistingArceuus Librarycustomers.

As this involves a lot of running, players should wearlightweight gear(e.g. fullGraceful) and bring a fewSuper energyorStamina potions.Most players spend most of their time earning favour at thelibrarysince it is the fastest method. It takes about two hours to gain 100% favour from zero when collecting multiple books at a time with no run restoration, and 30 minutes with energy potions.Always speak toBiblia, who roams the corridor on the top floor, for help with finding books andmanuscripts.At 20% favour, it is strongly recommended to focus on manuscripts while doing book runs along the wayonlyif they pose no inconvenience or entail going out of the way.Stockpiling manuscripts saves time, but it helps to turn them in if going to pastHorphis.You can stockpile books and scrolls by returning to the location of the most recent request and grabbing another copy after handing the original in.Even while remaining on the same world, the locations of books and manuscripts changes around every 80-100 minutes.Sharing the locations of books and manuscripts with other players allows you to find them much more quickly.If you plan to reanimate ensouled heads, it would be wisest to start reanimating at 60% favour. This is because reanimation also increases Arceuus favour is a more efficient way of reaching 100% while simultaneously training prayer and magic.

Favour benefits[edit|edit source]

At 20% favour, players can accessThyria's WaresandFilamina's Wares.At 60% favour, players can speak toTyssnext to theDark Altarto switch to theArceuus spellbook, which contains reanimation spells that are intended for use onensouled headsforPrayer training, and also increases Arceuus favour.At 100%, players can makedark essence blocks, made by usingdense essence blocksat the Dark Altar, which can be then used with achiselto createdark essence fragments, used inrunecraftingblood runesandsoul runes, which also require 100% favour.At 100% favour, players can createmagic tabletsto Arceuus spellbook teleports by using the lectern found in theOuditor's house.At 100% favour, players can speak toTyssto obtain anArceuus signet, which are required in buildingdark altarsoroccult altarswithin a player'sAchievement Gallery.
