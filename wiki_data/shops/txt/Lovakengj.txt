Lovakengj(/ˌloʊ.və.ˈkeɪn/loh-və-KAYN[1]) is one of the five cities in the Kingdom ofGreat Kourend, which resides in a volcanic area exclusively inhabited bydwarves. One of the three cities founded in the history of Great Kourend, Lovakengj was founded byYonrith Lovakengj,[2]the leader of a dwarven army allied withSaradominthat fought against theZarosiansatLassarduring theGod Wars. Today, the city is led byLady Vulcana Lovakengjof the Lovakengj House.

As one of the five cities of Great Kourend, the city is responsible for providing military equipment for theShayzien Army; their main export are ores found by blasting rocks withdynamitein theBlast Mine, in addition toShayzien armour, which is made fromlovakite, a unique metal found only within Lovakengj.

Since the establishment of trade routes between Great Kourend and the mainland, Lovakengj has established contact with theMining ConsortiumofKeldagrim, though they offer nothing notable to Lovakengj.[3]In the past, the city once had maintained contact with theimcando dwarvesin the southern kingdom ofVarlamore, who reside in an underground city beneath theAvium Savannah. However, they lost contact with them centuries ago,[4]presumably during theWar of the Five Houses.

Favour (historical)[edit|edit source]

Prior toan updateon10 January2024,favourwas a core mechanic of each city onKourend. Historical information about gaining favour and its benefits are documented below.

Gaining favour[edit|edit source]

Earning favour with Lovakengj requires you to assist in the collecting of resources for blast mining and the creation ofarmour. Blast mining will allow players to get ores at an accelerated rate, but only if they choose to invest their time with Lovakengj.

To progress in theArchitectural Allianceminiquest, players must gain 100% Lovakengj favour and speak toLovada, who is found in the building just outside theblast mine.

Dynamiteis used in the Lovakengj mining operations. It is created fromvolcanic sulphur,juniper charcoal,saltpetreand apot, then using the resultingdynamite potwith aball of wool. Adding the wool to the dynamite gives 0.1% favour.

To acquire the20%favour required forThe Forsaken Towerquest, you will need to make153dynamite. Alternatively, for a more simple method, an average of606Volcanic sulphurcan be mined. Achieving30%favour will require226dynamite,301for40%favour to be able to complete anelite clue scrollstep, and564for75%favour. This can then be raised to 100% by delivering all fiveminecart control scrolls. Additionally, you may completeThe Forsaken Tower(requires completion ofClient of Kourendand 20% Lovakengj favour) for another 10% favour, lowering the amount of dynamite required to achieve 100% to 498.

Alternatively, one can mine 3031 sulphur to get from 0% to 100% favour.

Note: All calculations take into account the small amounts of favour gained for mining volcanic sulphur.

Volcanic sulphur(Level 42Miningrequired), is found at thesulphur minein the north-west part of Lovakengj.Agas mask,face maskorslayer helmet/(i)is required when mining here!If the player is not wearing one of these items, then they are told "You'll choke on the fumes if you try to mine without protection". Each volcanic sulphur mined has a 1 in 3 chance of yielding 0.1% favour. Make sure to bring food when mining large amounts of volcanic sulphur, as the sulphur clouds will still deal rapid damage when nearby, even through a gas mask or face mask.Jugs of wineare an especially cheap method of healing from the damage taken.Note: If you choose to only mine volcanic sulphur to get your Lovakengj favour, you will want to use the safespot and shift/drop.Volcanic sulphuris not a notable item, so they are only droppable manually.

Juniper charcoalis created by addingjuniper logsgathered by cutting mature juniper tree (located by the saltpetre mines, and requires 42Woodcuttingto chop) to one of thecharcoal burnerson the beach next to the bank (max 60 per furnace) then light it and paySmoggy600coins(per furnace) to watch over the process for you. This takes about 16 hours and 30 minutes, and when it is complete the player will receive 50 charcoal per log they put in the furnace, producing 3,000 juniper charcoal per furnace.

Saltpetrecan be purchased in the Grand Exchange relatively cheaply. Otherwise, it is found in the area south of theHosidiusbank, and will spawn in one of five possible locations within the area, and moves once the deposit is depleted. Aspadeis required to gather saltpetre. A helpful tip is thatKonoo, a saltpetre digger, will be located wherever the latest saltpetre deposit is located. It is also a possible reward fromWintertodtandChambers of Xeric.

Empty pots can be purchased in bulk inToothy's Pickaxes, a store next to the bank chest near the sulphur mine.Ball of woolcan be purchased inLittle Munty's Little Shop, north-east of the southern bank. Ironman can stockpile large quantities ofBall of woolby purchasing fromJofridr MordstatterinNeitiznot. Alternatively, both of these components can be purchased from theGrand Exchange.

Once players reach 20% favour, they can start theThe Forsaken Towerquest. This quest requires completion ofClient of Kourend, and completion of the quest will grant aLovakengj favour certificateworth 10% favour.

Once players have 30% favour, they will receive permission to mine in thelovakite mine, wherelovakite orecan be found. These ores along with 2coalfor each ore, are then smelted in thelovakite furnace, a special furnace south of theBlast Mine(or usage of theSuperheat Itemspell), makinglovakite barsto smithShayzien supply armour. Players require level 65 (boosts work) inMiningto mine lovakite, and level 45Smithingto smelt the ore.

Players can smith various tiers of the supply armour depending on their Smithing level, and turn in the armour pieces to various armourers found throughout Lovakengj. Mining and Smithing experience will also be given as a reward.

However, by smithing a set of supply armour, consisting of a helm, platebody, greaves, gloves, and boots, players will gain larger amounts of favour by packing them into aShayzien supply crate, found within drawers in the houses of armourers. It takes 11 bars to make one full set of armour.

The tier players are able to smith are dependent on their Smithing level and the amount of favour players have:

At 30%, players can smith tier 1 supply armour for thearmourer (tier 1). Handing intier 1 supply cratesearns 1.5% favour per crate turned in, instead of 1.1% for all individual pieces. Full set requires 53Smithing.At 40%, players can smith tier 2 supply armour for thearmourer (tier 2). Handing intier 2 supply cratesearns 3% favour per crate turned in, instead of 2.2% for all individual pieces. Full set requires 63Smithing.At 50%, players can smith tier 3 supply armour for thearmourer (tier 3). Handing intier 3 supply cratesearns 4.5% favour per crate turned in, instead of 3.3% for all individual pieces. Full set requires 73Smithing.At 60%, players can smith tier 4 supply armour for thearmourer (tier 4). Handing intier 4 supply cratesearns 6% favour per crate turned in, instead of 4.4% for all individual pieces. Full set requires 83Smithing.At 70%, players can smith tier 5 supply armour for thearmourer (tier 5). Handing intier 5 supply cratesearns 7.5% favour per crate turned in, instead of 5.5% for all individual pieces. Full set requires 93Smithing.

Up to tier 3, if the player can not smith a full set, still make individual armour pieces from the highest tier possible. With access to tiers 4 and 5, do not make individual armour pieces as the full set from the tier below is always worth more favour per bar used.

With 73 - 82Smithing, the best method for achieving 30 - 100% favour is to work through the tiers:

30-40% - 7tier 1 supply crates(77lovakite ore, 154coal)40-50% - 4tier 2 supply crates(44lovakite ore, 88coal)50-100% - 11tier 3 supply crates(121lovakite ore, 242coal)

This takes a total of 242lovakite oreand 484coal.

To achieve 30 - 100% using a combination of making Shayzien supply armour & delivering minecart control scrolls, you can do the following:

30-40% - 7tier 1 supply crates(77lovakite ore, 154coal)40-50% - 4tier 2 supply crates(44lovakite ore, 88coal)50-77% - 6tier 3 supply crates(66lovakite ore, 132coal)77-100% - Deliver all fiveminecart control scrolls

This takes a total of 187lovakite oreand 374coal.

Once players reach 65% favour, they may speak toMiriamsouth of the southern Lovakengj bank to unlock theLovakengj Minecart Network. Players must deliver fiveminecart control scrollsto five different locations throughoutGreat Kourend. Each scroll delivered grants the player 5% favour, with a maximum of 25% available.

Players require achisel,tinderbox, anddynamitein order to blast hard rocks in the mine.
