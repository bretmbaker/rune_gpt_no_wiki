Entrances[edit|edit source]

Musa Point can only be entered one way by free players. To enter Musa Point, players need to go to Port Sarim and look for the three sailors,Seaman Lorris,Seaman Thresnor, andCaptain Tobias. They will ask if the player wants to go to Karamja. However, it costs 30coinsto sail to Karamja and 30 coins to sail back to Port Sarim.

Memberscan also enter via the gate to the east fromBrimhavenor use anamulet of gloryto teleport just south of thefishing spots.

When the player lands on Musa Point, they can then get off the boat to walk on the dock and explore the island. There aremonstersnear the north-western part of the island around the volcano, so low level players are recommended that they stay away from that part of the island. It is a spot for level 14scorpions, level 5snakes, and level 3monkeys. For lower/early-mid level players, it is a good training spot, as well as aPrayerspot, asmonkey bonesare dropped by the monkeys.
