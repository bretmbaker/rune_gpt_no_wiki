[Shop: Shop]

 | This article has a calculatorhere.Calculatorsdetermine experience and costs based on real-time prices from theGrand Exchange Market Watch.

AShopis any establishment which allows the trading ofcurrencyfor an item or service, or vice versa. Shop prices may be lower or higher than the equivalent item's price on theGrand Exchange, however, due to their fixed prices, shops cannot be susceptible to the market trends of the Grand Exchange.

Stock[edit|edit source]

Each shop has a maximum quantity of items in stock, which differs per item and per shop. Items can only be purchased in batches of 1, 5, 10 and 50. Whenever a shop has less of a certain item than their maximum capacity of that item, the shop will start to restock on that item. The time to restock varies between items. Only a single item will be re-added to the shop per restock, except in the case ofOre seller.which restocks items in batches. Items that aren't part of the shop's regular stock, or exceed their maximum capacity, will slowly be removed from the shop. Some shops, such asGrum's Gold Exchange.only have items with 0 stock, and so can only be sold to unless already overstocked from another player selling to them. Ironmen will not be able to purchase anything from these stores as any stocked items will be from other players. As they can only exist at 0 stock or overstocked, their "Restock" timer will only function as a "Destock" timer, and decrement the stock of any items back towards zero. There also exist shops such asThe Flaming ArroworFarming Suppliesthat have infinite stock, and are limited to only allowing the purchase of up to 10 items at a time.

Many shops have separate stock betweenMain accountsandIronmen, and stock can be further separated between group, ultimate, and regular ironmen. For example, if an ultimate ironman buys ores from Ore seller., the shop's stock will not decrease for main accounts, group ironmen, or regular ironmen. However, if an ironman sells an item to thePollnivneach general store, all other account types will see the shop's stock increase.

Any shop that sells aCape of Accomplishmenthas separate stock for players with and without level 99 in the respective skill, and further separate stock for players with that skill as theirfirst99, who can purchase an untrimmed cape.

Stock at any given shop always varies betweenworlds, which some players use to their advantage byhopping worldsin order to trade items at the best prices through many small transactions. Multiple shops sometimes share the same stock; for example, buying an item at theVoid Knight General Storedecreases that item's stock atJennifer's General SuppliesinShayzien.

Pricing[edit|edit source]

Players may sell any tradeable item to ageneral storefor a fixedvalue(usually its low alchemy value), or to specialty shops that specifically stock the item for a fixed higher value (usually its high alchemy value). These values will diminish by a fixed percentage that varies between shops for each stock increase. Regardless of how overstocked they are, all shops will buy the player's items for a minimum of 10% of the item's value. Players may buy any item in stock from a shop for a fixed value. This value will increase by the same fixed percentage mentioned previously for each stock decrease. Specialty shops use their maximum stock quantities as their fixed reference.

For example, asteel axehas a value of 200coins. It can be sold to most general stores for 80 coins (40% of its value), should the shop not have any steel axes in stock. If the player were to sell it to an axe shop such asBob's Brilliant Axes, then it would sell for 120 coins (60% of its value), shouldBobhave his default quantity of 3 steel axes in stock. Since Bob has a fixed percentage change of 2% per sale, then selling a steel axe to him with 4 already in stock would yield 116 coins (58% of its value). If a player were to buy a steel axe from Bob with 3 in stock, it would cost 200 coins. If 4 steel axes were in stock, the price would be 196 coins (98% of its value).
