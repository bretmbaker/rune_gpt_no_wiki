Waterbirth Island

Miscellaniais an island kingdom in theLunar Sea, north-west off the coast of theFremennik Province. It lies directly west of the island kingdom ofEtceteria, accessible via a bridge link.

The island kingdoms ofMiscellaniaandEtceteriaare the focus of two quests,Throne of MiscellaniaandRoyal Trouble. Prior to the player intertwining themselves in the affairs of the two islands, currently ruled byKing Vargasof Miscellania andQueen Sigridof Etceteria respectively, they had been at war for 100 years.

The islands are unique in that after the completion ofThrone of Miscellania, the islands may be managed by the player, a recurring activity/reward calledManaging Miscellania. This involves maintaining a favour level by performing favours for the island and giving gold to their coffers. In return, the citizens of will passively gather certain types of resources for you. After completion ofRoyal Trouble, the citizens ofEtceteriawill also work for you, increasing productivity.

Managing your kingdom[edit|edit source]

Resource gathering and the funding of it can be managed throughAdvisor Ghrim, who resides in the throne room in the castle on Miscellania.

If the subsequent questRoyal Troublehas been completed, the Kingdom of Etceteria will also begin working for the player.

Almost all resources the player collects on the island will be sent directly to the citizens of the island, increasing the popularity of the player for having done so.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The name "Miscellania" is a play on the word "miscellanea".The Etceterian dungeon entrance prevents players from walking around the outside of the castle along its eastern wall. Players who are walking from the north can bypass this by entering the dungeon and immediately leaving it, as they will reappear south of the entrance. Players wishing to walk in the other direction cannot use this trick as exiting the dungeon always places the player on the south side of the entrance.
