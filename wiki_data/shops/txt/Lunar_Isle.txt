Lunar Isleis an island shaped like a crescent moon, located in north-westGielinor. It is accessible formemberswho have gone far enough intoLunar Diplomacy. TheAstral Altaris located on this island. There is also abank, a magic shop, a clothes shop and a little island to the east inhabited bySuqah. It is home of theMoon Clan, beings with magic coursing through their blood, who are bitterly at war with theFremennik.

ASeal of passageis required to interact with any of the NPCs on the island. If the player interacts with an NPC without the seal equipped or in their inventory, there will be some dialogue, followed by the player being forcibly teleported toRellekka. This only happens if players continue with the conversation, thus players can avoid it by clicking outside of the dialogue. After completingDream Mentor, players can use only the bank booth where'Birds-Eye' Jackworks without a seal of passage, if they happened to forget it. All the other NPCs will still require the seal of passage.

After completing the elite tier of theFremennik Diary, players will no longer need a seal of passage to interact with any native Lunar Isle inhabitants, and theReturn Orbwill be usable in the bank to return to Rellekka.
