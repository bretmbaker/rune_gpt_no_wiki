Hunters' Rumours[edit|edit source]

Withinthe Burrow, the guild's pub underground, players can speak toGuild Scribe Verityto begin taking on Hunters' Rumours, an assignment system similar toSlayer tasksandfarming contracts. She may also enable back to back hunter rumours. By speaking to one of the Guild Hunters in the Burrow, players are tasked to investigate a rumour involving a specifichunter creature. This is done by hunting the creature until a rare creature part is received, and then bringing it back to the Guild Hunter.

Completing Hunters' Rumours reward the player with Hunter experience and ahunter's loot sack; the quality of these depend on the tier of the rumour assigned. Hunter's loot sacks typically contain various hunter meats, furs, andblessed bone shards, and may also reward unique items like theguild hunter outfitandhuntsman's kit. Players will also gain the ability to cook various hunter meats upon completing a specific amount of rumours.

The Roost[edit|edit source]

The Roost, found atop the guild, is where the guild raises Varlamore's quetzals. Though the player's personal landing site is found on the ground by the guild's entrance, players who have completed tenHunters' Rumourscan come up here and talk toSoar Leader Pitrito receive abasic quetzal whistle blueprint, which can be crafted into abasic quetzal whistle.

Quetzal whistles are used to "teleport" to the entrance of guild, allowing instant access to theQuetzal Transport Systemupon arrival, though players must charge it by giving Pitri certain hunter meats to feed the guild's quetzals; the higher level the meat, the more charges one receives. Blueprints for better variants, which hold more charges, can be obtained as possible loot from hunter's loot sacks.

Additionally, the whistles allow players to check their current Hunters' Rumour.

Hunter meats[edit|edit source]

Hunter meats, when eaten, will heal an initial amount before doing so again after 7 ticks (4.2 seconds), making it heal moreHitpointsoverall than otherFoodin its level bracket. If a second meat is eaten before the effect happens, only the most recent secondary heal will occur; however, the secondary effect willnotbe cancelled when eatingcooked karambwansor drinking a potion with a healing effect, such as a dose of aSaradomin Brewor aBarbarian Potion Mix.

Hunter meats are unique in that their raw forms can be stored in asmallorlarge meat pouchwhich iscraftedwith hunted creature products. This can allow for extended hunting trips but has limited use otherwise as the pouch cannot be emptied outside of abank.

By default, players with the appropriateCookinglevel can cook low tier hunter meat, but better quality meats require having completed a set amount ofHunters' Rumoursbefore being able to cook them:
