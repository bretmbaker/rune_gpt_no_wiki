Trivia[edit|edit source]

It is implied that the kebabs are made from camel meat.Ali the Camel ManinPollnivneachreveals about his discount camel store that "They're not just a source of kebab meat you know!"When using the "Talk-to Camel", the player character can quote "Mmm... looks like that camel would make a nice kebab."Eating kebabs is the only method oftemporarily boostingone's attack level in a free-to-play server (albeit very rarely).Kebabs originally had a chance of dealing damage to the player's hitpoints as an adverse effect; however, this feature was removed to prevent players from being killed inadvertently.
