Type | Melee



Plateskirtsare a type ofarmourworn mainly bywarriorsin the leg slot. Amongmeleeattack types, plateskirts provide good defence against the slash attack type but are more vulnerable to the crush attack type. Plateskirts give a player penalties towards ranged attacks and penalties towards magic defence. However, plateskirts have very good defence against ranged attacks.

Standard plateskirts can be made with theSmithingskill (with the exception of theblack,whiteanddragonplateskirts) or purchased at the plateskirt shop identified by theiconon themap.

They are less popular and consequently more affordable than the platelegs, despite having identical stats, weighing 1 kg less, and not being gender-locked (i.e. male characters can wear plateskirts and female characters can wear platelegs).
