[Shop: Currencies]

Currenciesare items whose primary purpose is to be exchanged (for other items, services, or experience) in a consistent, repeatable fashion, and are primarily used for transactions inRuneScape.

Coins(gold pieces or "gp") are the main form of currency and are almost universal, as they are accepted by mostshops. All other currencies may only be used at their specific location. Onlytrading sticksare comparable to gold pieces in that they can be used to buy and sell items in multiple places as well as to trade with other players, although their usage is much more limited than usage of gold pieces.

Virtual[edit|edit source]

Many currencies are virtual (or kept 'on record') and don't exist in an item form. Thus, these do not take up inventory or bank space, and only appear in specific interfaces. This also makes them untradeable. For example, Pizazz points are stored in aProgress hat. These currencies usually don't have an associated icon.
