Leather[edit|edit source]

To begin leather crafting, players need aneedleandthread, normally purchased from theAl KharidorRimmingtonCrafting shops, and somecowhidetanned intoleather. In afree-to-playworld, this means visiting the tanner in Al Kharid until players are able to enter the guild. Tanning costs 1coinper ordinary leather, 3 coins forhard leather, and 20 coins fordragonhide. There is also a more expensive tannery available toMembersinCanifis.

The cattle field east ofLumbridgeis a convenient spot for leather crafters and is easy to get to, but it is normally largely populated. Another convenient location to obtain cowhide in a free-to-play world is to the west of theCrafting Guild, where there are many morecowstogether in a smaller place, allowing faster kills. For Members, there is a field of cows north ofArdougneand west of theLegends' Guild, which is fairly close to abankand very rarely occupied by players.

Note:1 spool ofthreadcan make up to 5 pieces ofleather armour.

ThisMembers-only part of the Craftingskillis extremely similar to normal leather crafting, except that:

20are paid to tan one piece of hide.Only vambraces, chaps, shields, and bodies can be made.High Level Alchemyis better cast on dragonhide bodies or vambraces rather than chaps, for their difference in coins received.Killing dragons for their hides is slow but profitable. Buying dragonhides is faster, though price is far higher than the high-alchemy value.Players may attachkebbit clawsto any vambraces to makespiked vambraces, giving them a +2Strengthbonus and granting 6 Craftingexperience.
