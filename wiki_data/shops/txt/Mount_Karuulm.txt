Mount Karuulmis a volcano found in the northern edge of theKebos Lowlands. It is inhabited by theKahlith, servants of theTasakaal, a trio of ancientTzHaarthat had left theKaramja Volcanolong ago.

This volcano is unique in that it is sulphurous, giving the lava a bluish appearance due to the combination of sulphuric gases and lava, and is the only known sulphurous volcano inGielinor.

History[edit|edit source]

Sometime during theGod Wars, before the arrival of refugees that would go on to foundArceuus,LovakengjandPiscarilius, the continent ofZeahwas uninhabited and untouched by the war, until the arrival of aDragonkinnamedKaruulm, who travelled to the volcano to find a way to lift the Curse ailing his kind due to interruptions from his fellow dragonkin.

During his occupation in Mount Karuulm, he had managed to create thewyrmsanddrakes. The wyrms were created intending to bring about their original purpose, but they were deemed failures. Sometime later, he created drakes, one he had suggested to Kerapac but was rejected as Kerapac preferred working with dragons instead. Eventually, he created thehydrasafter some deliberation. The hydras impressed him, and he created anenhancedversion, which showed promise but still deemed a failure because he could not replicate its traits. Karuulm eventually abandoned the mountain after the influx of new arrivals.

After an unknown amount of time passed, threeTzHaar, unable to stand by and wait for their master after watching the world fall into disarray, left theKaramja Volcanoand arrived at Mount Karuulm. Due to the sulphuric nature of the volcano, they became theTasakaal. The Tasakaal intended to bring balance to the world, and several humans, inspired by their cause, began to work for them. These humans changed into theKahlith, and work with the Tasakaal to bring balance; for every life, there must be a death.

The Kahlith explored the abandoned laboratory and humans training their Slayer skill would go in and slay the monsters inside. Some areas were protected by the Kahlith to maintain the balance, only allowing those who had been assigned them as a Slayer task to use their facilities.

Mount Karuulm is inspired by the real-lifeIjenvolcano in Indonesia, which is famous for its electric-blue sulphuric flames that can be seen at night due to the volcano's composition.Mount Karuulm was originally proposed to be the city of Keruulm, an ancient city found in a dormant volcano. To enter the remains of the volcano and access the city, highStrengthandAgilitylevels were required. Here, players would find the Tasakaal, an incredibly strong and ancient race who were born and bred guardians.
