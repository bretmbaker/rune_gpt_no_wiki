Description[edit|edit source]

Inhabitants[edit|edit source]

The Fremennik Province is noted for being ruled solely by one group ofhumans, the Fremennik. Over the years, groups of Fremennik left the mainland inRellekkaand created new settlements. However, the tribes still interact with each other through robust trade.

The Fremennik distrust all "Outerlanders", anyone not within their tribe. Since all humans were once Fremennik, the Fremennik Province is actually the birthplace of mankind.

The only other significant race that has managed to survive within the Fremennik Province are thedwarves, who have lived in the province for nearly as long as the Fremennik. During theGod Wars, the dwarves hid themselves in the Fremennik Province, after nearly being wiped out. They created a large city namedKeldagrimbeneath the surface of the Fremennik Province, and have thrived there ever since.

There are other races that have made their homes in the Fremennik Province, but they are few, and their settlements are very small. Thetrolls, for instance, live partially in the area, and wage war against the Fremennik at every opportunity. There are also rumours that a group of intelligentpenguinshave established an outpost on theicebergnorth of Rellekka, but these reports are unconfirmed.

Climate[edit|edit source]

The Fremennik Provinces's climate is known for being very harsh. In Rellekka and the surrounding area, the wind carries a bitter cold air from theLunar Sea. The wind is so strong that the trees in the area are known to be permanently bent in one direction.

Further north, the climate becomes even colder. Snow is known to fall almost year-round, and on some islands, such asMiscellaniaandEtceteria, the wind becomes so strong that the residents are forced the take shelter in the towns' castles and underground.

Even farther north are the icelands of Acheron. Little is known of these lands, although they are said to be so inhospitable that few can survive long there. Although players cannot yet visit them, it is believed they will have an effect similar to theKharidian Desert.

Economics[edit|edit source]

The Fremennik have mastered many skills, although most refuse to usemagic. Their main industries includefishing,hunting, andfarming. Like the Fremennik themselves, the area's industry is very geography-dependent.

The area's economy is stimulated by the dwarves ofKeldagrim, whose technology surpasses that of the Fremennik. Keldagrim is known to produce many metals, which are then traded with the Fremennik.

Amongst players, the Fremennik Province is fairly popular, although it is not as crowded as areas such asMisthalinandAsgarnia. The diversity of the area's resources has made it a popular area to obtain raw materials.
