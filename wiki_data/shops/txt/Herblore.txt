Potions[edit|edit source]

Most potions act as atemporary skill boost, but some have other effects, like curingpoisonor providingdragonfire protection. A player must add asecondary ingredientto theunfinished potion, finishing the potion completely. A newly finished vial of potion contains three (3) doses of the potion. Some higher-level potions require a vial ofcoconut milkorbloodto be used instead of water.

Wearing anamulet of chemistrygives a 5% chance of creating a four (4) dose potion instead. A chargedalchemist's amuletincreases this chance to 15%.Prescription gogglesgive players a 10% chance to not consume a secondary ingredients when mixing potions. These items can be useful for conserving resources onIronman accountsor for potions with rare or expensive ingredients.

Mastering Mixology[edit|edit source]

Trivia[edit|edit source]

InRuneScape Classic, the skill was spelled "Herblaw". This was the case in2001when it was first listed in the skills list (even though it was unimplemented prior to the release ofPay-to-playin2002), untilClassicclosed in2018.Paul Gowerstated that the skill was renamed inRuneScape 2because Herblaw is "spelled wrong".[1][2]There are prior usages of the word "Herblore" going back to at least the 1800s[3]but no such prior usage for the word "Herblaw". Players ofClassicgenerally did not consider the skill to be spelled wrong, since it is a very obscure word not found in most dictionaries, and it was used in the fantasy setting ofRuneScape.
