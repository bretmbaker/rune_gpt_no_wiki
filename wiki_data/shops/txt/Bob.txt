Involvement in Quests and Events[edit|edit source]

During theThe Lost Tribequest, Bob is one of the people inLumbridgethat can be approached about the disturbance to the castle basement wall. He says he saw a goblin with bulging eyes enter a hole inLumbridge castle basement, and tried to follow it, but it was too dark. He toldthe Dukeabout what he saw.During theDeath to the Dorgeshuunquest, Bob is one of the people who you can bringZanikto see, during her initial exploration of the overworld. Bob expresses strong disgust towards theDorgeshuun, screaming at the player and Zanik"Get out of my shop! GET OUT!" [...]  We don't serve the likes of that thing in here.During the2017 Birthday event, Bob was one of several NPCs to challenge the player with a riddle. His riddle was about the cost of repairing an axe, in reference to his historical role repairing axes for players who failed to notice theEnt random eventin time.During the2018 Christmas event, Bob gave the player anAmulet of duplication.During the2019 Halloween event, Bob told the player about a fight that occurred between two goblin trick-or-treaters outside his shop if asked.During the20th Anniversary event, Bob expressed displeasure at having theGnome Childin his store. Initially, he said"We don't normally serve its kind in this shop."[a], before being flattered after the Gnome Child mistook him forRobert the Strongand deciding"Your gnome friend is weird, but he's welcome."During the2021 Birthday event, Bob was one of theLumbridgecitizens to beattacked by a monkey.During the2023 Birthday event, Bob fixed theCracked cake tin.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Bob was the first non-player character added toRuneScape Classic. He can be seen in pre-release screenshots with a different skin tone, as his addition predated the option to change the skin of characters."Bob is a crazy racist!"according to aRuneScriptcode comment accompanying Bob's hysterical outburst towardsZanikduring theDeath to the Dorgeshuunquest.[2]. This comment was written byMod John A, the main developer of that quest. After Death to the Dorgeshuun was released in2006, "crazy racist" became one of Bob's defining character traits going forward.Prior to the removal of theEnt random eventin2014, Bob would repair a player'sBroken axeif they failed to notice the Ent in time.The painting inside Bob's Brilliant Axe's may be a reference toBob Ross's "Distant Mountains" painting, as the framing and subject are nearly identical.As a child, Bob was sent to theVarrock Museumby his father, hoping he'd follow the path of academia. The museum instead assigned him to preserve and repairThird Age Armour, a skill he picked up rather quickly. In the May 2022 edition of thePostbag from the Hedge, he credits this experience as the reason he is able to repair ancient and exotic armours such as those dropped by theBarrows Brothers.
