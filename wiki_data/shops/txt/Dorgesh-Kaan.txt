History[edit|edit source]

During theGod Wars, theDorgeshuun("Goblins of the Strong Spears", in the ancient goblin language[1]), were like other goblins at the time: a war-driven tribe enlisted to fight for their "Big High War God",Bandos.[2]However, the Dorgeshuun, at one point, became resistant to the idea of having to sacrifice their lives for their god and, after being sent off to do battle for him once more, they instead sneaked off into a hole where they could hide from his wrath.[3]After a cave-in, their refuge had been cut-off from the surface world until recent events involving the player. The city was founded around 2900 years ago during theFourth Age, though the leadership began to shift from their generals to the council that advised them.[4]Acivil warerupted and subsequently ended with the council-led republic of the Dorgeshuun victorious, the city continued developing to become one of the largest cities inGielinorin the swamp-likeLumbridgeunderground, complete with its unique technologies and culture.[5][6]In the present day, the city is open toLumbridgevisitors afterMistagand thecave goblin minersaccidentally breached the walls of theLumbridge Castle cellarand a peace treaty was signed between Dorgesh-Kaan and Lumbridge.

They are still currently led by a republic of seven councils who convene at the Dorgeshuun Council chamber for whatever executive functions need to be done.[7]

The elaborate city makes use ofmetal wiresandlight orbsin their city-wide lamppost system, as well as bones forconstructionmaterial such as for their market stalls and for propping up mining tunnels.[8]The Dorgeshuun have their own unique cuisine, obtainable through trading and exchanging with marketplace goblins who will swap Dorgeshuun foods for the player's food from the surface world.[9]
