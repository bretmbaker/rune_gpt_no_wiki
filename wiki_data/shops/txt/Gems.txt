[Shop: Gems]

Gemsare valuable stones that are primarily used inCrafting. They can be obtained fromMining(either randomly while mining other ores or fromgem rocks), as a frequent drop from a wide range ofmonstersvia part of therare drop tableor occasionally given out as gifts from variousrandom events. Many types of gems can be purchased or sold (or stolen) atgem shops, identified with a red gemiconon themap().

While mining most ore rocks orMotherlode Mineore veins, players have a 1/256 chance of receiving a geminsteadof an ore; this does not deplete the ore rock.[1]Wearing a chargedamulet of glory(of any number of charges other than 0) increases this chance to 1/86; wearing one while mining gem rocks increases the speed at which they are mined. It may be worth noting that the gems found randomly whilst mining most ores do not grant any additional Mining experience. Mining gems fromgem rocks, however, does grant experience.

Using the Crafting skill, gems can becut. From there, they can be made intojewellery, which can then be enchanted using theMagicskill, or into gembolt tipsusing theFletchingskill.
