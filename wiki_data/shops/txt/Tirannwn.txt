Tirannwn(pronunciation:/tɪˈranʊn/TIR-an-un[1]) is a heavily forested region located west ofKandarin. It can only be accessed via theUnderground Passafter startingRegicide. Other ways of entry, all of which are only available after completion ofRegicide, include boarding a charter ship toPort Tyras, travelling throughArandar,Iorwerth camp teleportscrolls, andelf teleport crystalsobtained during or afterMourning's End Part I.

Theelveslived for many hundreds of years and saw theGod Wars. It is said that the elves retreated there, but it is not said when.

Apart from elves, there arerabbits,dire wolves, andgrizzly bearsthat inhabit Tirannwn. The many traps and dense forest make travelling through Tirannwn difficult and potentially dangerous (seeTrapsfor more details). It is wise to bringanti-poison potions(or equivalent) andfood. Level 56Agilityis required to navigate Tirannwn fully, as players may come across dense forest that requires 56 Agility to go through.

Leaf trap: Deals fifteen damage. Approach them and select jump at the side nearest to you.Stick traps: Deal eight damage. Click on the base of the trap to pass. Stand right next to it then spam click the trap until you pass it. Failure to pass will give you a face full of spikes, hit damage and throw you back.Tripwire: Somewhat hard to spot and which require you to select to hop over. Failure results in two arrows being fired dealing five damage each and poisoning you (starting at two). The success chance of passing this trap ranges linearly from 30/255 (11.76%) at level one Agility to 155/255 (60.78%) at level 99 Agility[2]
