Meiyerditch

Darkmeyeris thecapitalcity ofMorytanialocated in theSanguinesti region, north ofMeiyerditch. It is inhabited byvampyresand ruled byLowerniel Drakan, his sisterVanescula Drakanand brotherRanis Drakan. Darkmeyer andMeiyerditchappear to be twin cities, with Darkmeyer making up the northern half of the region and Meiyerditch the southern half. The vampyric inhabitants get most of their blood fromblood tithesconducted in the rundown neighbouring concentration campMeiyerditch.

The city can be entered with partial completion of the questSins of the Father, but completion of the quest and wearing a set ofvyre noble clothingis required to access most of its features.

History[edit|edit source]

The city was founded and ruled byLowerniel Drakanafter his successful invasion ofHallowvale.[1]Before he completely took over Hallowvale,Queen Efaritay, who was also a renowned botanist, bred all kinds of plant life to use against the vampyres, one of which was theblisterwood treefound in the heart of the city.[2]Unable to destroy the tree, the vampyres sealed it within Efaritay's oldArboretum, with the Drakans ordering that no one is to enter the building.[3]During this time, theArchpriest of the Unicornand his followers also began to create safeguards for theHallowed Sepulchre[4]to prevent the vampyres from gaining access to the secrets and treasure within.[5]

At some point Lowerniel Drakan departed, leaving the ruling of Darkmeyer and the Sanguinesti region to his siblings,VanesculaandRanis Drakan. In recent times, the vampyres are now facing a blood shortage crisis due to overpopulation,[6]forcing them to seek alternative methods to obtaining blood, such as havingwerewolvesattempt to cross theRiver Salveto kidnap humans, andDamien Leucurtecausing the Sleeper Plague upon the citizens of Slepe to tithe more blood from them.

This crisis, along with Lowerniel's continued absence, causesVanescula Drakanto turn against her brother.[7]She soon crafts plot to overthrow him by proposing an alliance withThe Myreque, the resistance group attempting to liberate Morytania. Providing them with the means to infiltrate Darkmeyer and access the blisterwood tree to make weapons to use against Lowerniel, she brings them toCastle Drakanunder the pretence that she was bringing them in as prisoners. However, Lowerniel easily sees through his sister's lies,[8]killing her servants and subduing her, alongside killing half of the remaining Myreque members.
