TheGrand Exchange, commonly referred to as theGE, is a trading system for players to purchase and sell tradeable items inOld School RuneScape. It was released on26 February2015followinga content pollwhere it passed by 76.3%, narrowly passing the 75% threshold.Membersget eight Grand Exchange slots, each of which may be used to either buy or sell items; however,free playersare limited to three. Additionally, free players may only purchase free-to-play items, and not members' items.

In the event that a member lists a sell offer and then their membership expires prior to fulfillment, the trade remains active and the item will sell when the price rises. No restriction exists on selling items, regardless of memberships status. However, if a player has been logged out for several days, any unfulfilled offers will pause until they log back in.

Traders do not need to advertise, meet each other, or even wait at the Grand Exchange for trades to finish, becausecoinsand items from fully and partially finished trades can be collected at anybank. Additionally, players will receive a message in their chatbox when the status of a trade offer is updated. This trading system resembles a real-life electronic asset exchange and has since replaced thetrading postand the older marketplaces inVarrockandFalador.

Ironmenthat use the Grand Exchange are redirected to a unique interface that allows them to purchasebondswhile disallowing them from buying or selling any other item. There is also aloot chest, which non-ironmanplayer-killersmay use to cash inloot keysfrom players they killed.

Due to its location and economic importance, the Grand Exchange is one of the most popular locations in the game world. It is usually the most populated area on the map outside of bosses and minigames on themed worlds, which sometimes causes issues with loading player avatars due to the large number of people in one place. As such, it is often considered the game'spublic squareon any given server, and both standard accounts and ironmen regularly use the Grand Exchange for social interaction with other players.

Operation[edit|edit source]

Exact details on the internals of the Grand Exchange are not publicly known. However, some parts of its operation are understood through experience.

Players interact with the Grand Exchange by making buy and sell offers for items, at prices of their choosing. Trades succeed when one player's buy offer is greater than or equal to another player's sell offer. The actual price a successful trade occurs at depends on which side made the offer first:

If a buy offer is made and lower sell offers already exist, then the trade succeeds between the lowest sell offer, and the buyer gets gold back.If a sell offer is made and higher buy offers already exist, then the trade succeeds between the highest buy offer, and the seller gets more gold than their offer.[1]

If multiple buy or sell offers exist at same price, older offers are loosely prioritised over newer ones when matching.[1]

Guide prices[edit|edit source]

When creating a trade offer, the initial price is set to a guide value. This guide is automatically updated based on the trade history of the item and is intended to represent its approximate market value.

WhileJagexhas never published the Grand Exchange's exact pricing algorithms, guide prices are generally governed by the laws ofsupply and demand:

If an item's demand is higher than supply, then its price will increase.If an item's supply is higher than demand, then its price will decrease.If an item's demand matches its supply, then its price will not change.

The prices of items are updated based on their recently traded prices and volume. For items with low trade volume such aspartyhats, their prices update every few days or even once a week, and can be inaccurate. Jagex can also intervene and set the prices themselves, and they reserve the right to intervene when they believe price manipulation is occurring on an inexcusable scale, or when items that appear more expensive than their actual value are used for scamming. TheGrand Exchange Market Watchcontains up-to-date information on the prices for various items.

The guide prices are also a basis forDeath's Coffersacrifices andItems Kept on Deathmechanics.

Item sets[edit|edit source]

Mostarmoursets and thedwarf multicannoncan be assembled into sets to save space. They behave like ordinary items except that they cannot be worn or used until disassembled. Only the Grand Exchange clerks and bankers can assemble or disassemble sets, and they will do so an unlimited number of times for free.

Ultimate ironmenmay not assemble items into sets.

Pricing experts[edit|edit source]

Around the Grand Exchange are six pricing experts who show the current prices of various items.

Brugsen Bursencan be right-clicked to search for an item's guide price.Farid Morrisaneshows the prices ofores,barsandgems.Relobo Blinyoshows the prices oflogs.Bob Bartershows the prices ofherbsandpotions. He alsodecantspotions into full and empty vials. He can decant potions even if they are noted.Murky Mattshows the prices ofrunes. He also "decants" charged items into full and empty charges.Hofuthandshows the prices of certainweaponsandarmour.

Additionally,Jamescan be found outside the Grand Exchange main entrance, and gives information aboutmembership bonds.

Buy limits[edit|edit source]

The buying rate is restricted to a certain quantity every 4 hours. Some items have a connected limit, meaning that you can only buy a certain amount of either item, or a mix of the two up to a particular point. For example, if the player has reached the limit on 4-dosePrayer potions, they cannot buy Prayer potions of fewer doses. However, there are no restrictions on selling items.

Volume[edit|edit source]

Volume is a measure of the quantity of items that have been traded on the Grand Exchange. This number is not directly available in-game, but can be viewed on the officialOld School RuneScapeGrand Exchange website database. Items that commonly have high daily volume are supplies likerunesandores, as well as ranged weapons likearrows,dartsandcannonballs.

Non-tradeable items[edit|edit source]

Some items cannot be traded using the Grand Exchange, but can still be traded using traditional player-to-player trade. For example,burnt foodscannot be traded with the GE service, and have no in-game value.

Other items with a similar property include partially charged jewellery (games necklace) or equipment (black mask), half-eaten food items (slice of cake), recipe items (uncooked cake),currency(platinum tokens) and Castle Warsbandages.

New account trade restrictions[edit|edit source]

Newfree-to-playaccounts have trade restrictions in place until the account's logged in time surpasses 20 hours of game time, 10 or morequest pointsare acquired,andreaching 100 total level.[2]Such restrictions include a block from selling certain items on theGrand Exchange. This restriction is in place to help preventbottedand black-market goods from entering the economy, as many of the accounts are caught and banned before they can be logged in for 20 hours in total.[3]

Convenience fee and item sink[edit|edit source]

Most transactions on the Grand Exchange are subject to a 1% tax, orconvenience fee, capped at a maximum of 5 million coins per item. The money from this tax is then collected byJagex; most is removed from the game, while a small amount is used to purchase select items from other players and delete them from the game to regulate their price. Both of these features were implemented on9 December2021in the (unpolled)Grand Exchange Tax & Item Sinkupdate.

The 1% tax rounds down to the nearest whole number, so items sold for below 100 coins have a tax of less than one coin, and so have no tax obligation. Note that this means the seller receives 99 coins if they set the price per item to99orto100, but in the latter case, the buyer pays a single additional coin to the tax. This generalises to all transactions with a price that is an exact multiple of 100: the seller receives 198 coins if they set the price per item to199orto200, and so on. This is rarely significant, as single coin difference is irrelevant for all but the cheapest items, but it does mean that undercutting a sell offer for any exact multiple of 100 coins is effectively free.

Items regulated via item sink[edit|edit source]

The following items are periodically purchased by Jagex (from players) using funds from the convenience fee; they are then deleted from the game to better control market supply and prevent item devaluation. This is the most prominent example of an in-gameitem sink.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

 | Grand Exchange transaction completed





A short jingle plays when a buy or sell transaction is completed on the Grand Exchange, which contains the beginning melody from The Trade Parade accompanied by flutes and other whimsical elements.On the buy/sell interface, if anOld School RuneScape Mobileuser on Android tries to input a custom value, the numeric keyboard will display. This keyboard curiously contains a negative "-" sign as an option, but it does nothing when pressed.A player can "Buy all that you can afford" by right-clicking the [...] button and selecting the "All" option.Concept art shows that the roof of the Grand Exchange was originally intended to be accessible and have a spire in the center.
