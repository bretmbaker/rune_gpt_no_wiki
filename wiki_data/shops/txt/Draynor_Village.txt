Draynor Village, often shortened toDraynor, is a small village located betweenFaladorandLumbridge. The village is featured in many quests, and is a popular training location due to itswillow treesandmaster farmers.

History[edit|edit source]

ThevampyreCount Draynor, formerly ofHouse Drakan, was banished fromMorytaniaby his brotherLord Lowerniel Drakan. The banishment pushed the Count over theRiver Salve, greatly weakening him[1]. He eventually reached the area that is now Draynor Village, along with his servant,Ruantun. It is unlikely that the village existed at the time of his arrival, given that the village is named after him.

Towards the end of theFourth Age, Draynor Village grew alongside the rest ofMisthalin[2]. With the discovery ofrunes, the study ofmagicculminated in the construction of theWizards' Toweron a small islet south of Draynor Village[3].

As the village grew, the Count terrorised it from hislarge mansionnorth of the village. In the year 169, the village was finally freed of the Count by anadventurer, who killed him by pushing astakethrough his heart.

Marketplace[edit|edit source]

There are several shops in the marketplace:

Diango's Toy Store, a place where players can buyfun weaponsand retrieve non-tradeableholiday items.Draynor Seed Market, a stall ran byOlivia. Mosthopsandvegetable seedscan be bought from her, and all can be stolen from the stall.Forestry Shop, a shop ran by theFriendly Foresterthat exchangeForestrycurrency for unique rewards.Wine Shop, a stall run byFortunatowhich stocksbottlesandjugs of wine, as well asjugs of vinegar.

Skill training spots[edit|edit source]

In addition to training combat by fighting the various monsters in the village, there are spots in Draynor for players to trainFishing,Woodcutting,Firemaking,Agility, andThieving:

Fivewillow treesgrow in close proximity of each other just south-west of the bank, making it a popular Woodcutting location forfree-to-playplayers. The large open space east of the trees also makes it popular for training Firemaking. Be warned that in-between the trees are twoaggressivelevel 7dark wizards, who will attack any players undercombat level15. It is therefore not advised to train Woodcutting here with a lower combat.On the shore next to the trees are severalnetandbaitfishing spots, which can be used to catch eithershrimps,anchovies,sardines, andherring.The marketplace features two thievableseed stallsand one thievablewine stall. These stalls are guarded by a pair ofmarket guards, who attack players who attempt to steal, or players who talk to any stall owners just after thieving from their stalls. In order to maximise the amount of stalls that can be thieved per hour, it is recommended to trap the two market guards in theWise Old Man's house. This can be done by attacking them, then walking into the Old Man's house and closing the door with the guards still inside. Players can walk up the stairs in order to remove aggression from the market guards afterwards. Using this method, players can expect much higher experience rates per hour.TheDraynor Village Rooftop Courseruns all the way around the village, starting at the furthest north-east house and ending atNed's house. The course requires level 1 Agility to access.
