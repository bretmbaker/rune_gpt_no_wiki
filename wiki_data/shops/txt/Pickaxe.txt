Pickaxes, often abbreviated topicks, are tools used tomineany type oforeor otherwisemineable items, and some types of blockages inGielinor. Pickaxes can either be held in theinventoryor wielded; but, to wield a pickaxe, the wielder'sAttacklevel must be high enough. Wielding the pickaxe provides extra space in the inventory. This is useful when mining for a profit, as one extra ore can be held.

Higher level pickaxes grant more frequent opportunities to obtain an ore from arock, but have no effect upon the chance of successfully doing so.[1]

Pickaxes cannot be made by players. They can be bought fromNurmof's Pickaxe Shop,Yarsul's Prodigious Pickaxes,Pickaxe-Is-Mine,Toothy's Pickaxes, andGwyn's Mining Emporium.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

In the early days ofRuneScape Classic, there was only one type of pickaxe available, named simplyPickaxe. It resembled a steel pickaxe and could not be equipped. When different types of pickaxes were released in May 2003, all pickaxes in the bank became the bronze pickaxes that are commonly found today.Broken pickaxes, before being removed after an update, were able to be wielded. But once unequipped, they could no longer be equipped by the player. They possessed the same bonuses as their unbroken counterparts.
