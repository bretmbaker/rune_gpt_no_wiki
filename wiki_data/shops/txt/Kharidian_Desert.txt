TheKharidian Desertis an expansive region located south of the nations ofMisthalinandMorytania. The desert becomes a dangerous region south of theShantay Pass, requiring a player to drink fromwaterskinsor othersources of waterto avoid dehydration. The player will automatically drink every 90 seconds if they have a waterskin with charges in their inventory; the time between drinks can be extended by wearingheat-resistant gear. Failing to drink will cause the player to periodically losehitpoints. Within the boundaries of towns, players are immune to the desert heat and do not need to drink.

Players may quickly travel to certain locations by usingmagic carpetrides, though some destinations are unavailable until certain quests have been completed.

For many years the desert was incomplete and surrounded by multiple inaccessible black zones; as of 2023, only a small portion to the south and the cityMenaphosremain inaccessible.

This region also has its ownachievement diarythat was released on5 March2015, along with many other diaries.
