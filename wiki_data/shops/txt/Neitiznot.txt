Neitiznot(Jagex:/ˈneɪ.tɪz.nɒt/NAY-tizz-not) is a fortified town on one of theFremennik Islesthat can be accessed by talking toMaria Gunnarson the most north-eastern pier inRellekka. This requires the completion ofThe Fremennik Trialsas well as startingThe Fremennik Isles. Neitiznot was founded byKing Neitiznot; his counterpart,King Jatizso, founded the opposing village,Jatizso.

During and after thequestthe village offers the following advantages:

Yaks are great for combat training and the 100% drops (hide and hair) represent a potential of 57 Crafting experience. With a short bank trip, it makes sense to bank all drops for later Crafting.

Neitiznot is a better place than Jatizso to train on ice trolls without a cannon, because there's a lot fewer trolls than on Jatizso, and you also have level 115Honour guardshelping you.

There is currently only one teleport that can get you to Neitiznot without the need of the boat, which is theEnchanted lyreafter completion of the EliteFremennik Diary.

History[edit|edit source]

Over a hundred years ago, twoFremennikbrothers,NeitiznotandJatizso, were banished by their father (who was the king ofRellekkaat the time) for their often frustrating rivalry between each other. Shortly after their banishment, they stumbled upon two neighbouring islands north-west of Rellekka. Neitiznot chose the island to the west and named its community after himself. Some time later he was confronted by his brother Jatizso who demanded the island for his own (it is unknown if he knew Jatizso was on the other island and may have been planning to visit it). Neitiznot came out and denied his demand, and the feud continued. To this day, Neitiznot's descendants still have a fierce rivalry with the citizens of Jatizso.

Climate and geography[edit|edit source]

Since it is in the north it snows most of the year and cold winds blow through it year round (shown by the trees shaking). However, unlike its sister islandJatizsoit has good soil for growing trees and plants. It's divided into two islands, the southern and northern island. The southern part houses the settlement of Neitiznot and theyaks. The northern one is currently infested with trolls who are fighting theHonour guardof Neitiznot. It does contain however, a large amount ofarctic pinetrees, a vein ofrunite ore, and somecoalore.
