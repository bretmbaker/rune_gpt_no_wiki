Meiyerditchis a slum ruled byLord Drakanand his family from the city of vampyresDarkmeyer, the capital ofMorytania. Once the capital city of theSaradoministkingdom ofHallowvaleprior to theGod Wars, the city fell to vampyric control during the kingdom's fall in theThird Age; today, its inhabitants now live in slums and are forced to giveblood tithes.

Getting to Meiyerditch[edit|edit source]

Players may reach Meiyerditch by boarding the boat south ofBurgh de Rott, on the eastern dock, or by taking the rowboat toSlepenorth ofPort Phasmatysfor 10,000 coins.

If a player plans to come to this city, the player must begin theDarkness of Hallowvalequest. The first thing any adventurer will notice is that Meiyerditch is patrolled by the invincibleVyrewatch. The only weapons that can kill them are theIvandis flailand theBlisterwood flail. If they ask for a blood tithe, do not give it to them if you don't want to lose 6 of yourhitpointsand try to distract them instead based onThievinglevel (i.e. the higher the level, the less chance of failing). If this fails, the player will be forced to give a blood tithe. After some time into the Darkness of Hallowvale, the player will have another option of being sent tothe minesinstead of giving a blood tithe.

Alternatively after completingA Taste of Hope, the player is rewardedDrakan's medallion, which can be used to teleport toVer Sinhazain the south-eastern part of Meiyerditch.

Once into the main part of the city, the player will be greeted byMeiyerditch citizens,Meiyerditch children, stray dogs, and cats. Also, to greet the player are level 46Vampyre Juveniles, but they are non-aggressive.

Features[edit|edit source]

The area is in ruin, which makes for good moderate levelAgilitytraining. Meiyerditch is essentially a highly populatedAgility courseif the player is doingDarkness of Hallowvaleand is at theAgilitysection of navigating through the city.

The area also contains theVer Sinhazathe former palace ofQueen Efaritay, now ruled byLady Verzik Vitur, hostess of theTheatre of Blood, a game challenge where the people of Meiyerditch can fight for their freedom, and players can fight for a chance of receiving valuable rewards.

Conditions within Meiyerditch are terrible. The city is overcrowded, with humans crowded into small wooden apartments that have long since lost walls and roofs to rot. Food is rare, and many are forced to eat rats to survive. Clothing and other basic necessities are also in short supply. All throughout the city, dying citizens can be seen huddled against walls and in the dark confines of alleys.

TheDaeyalt oremines may be accessed either through attracting aVyrewatch's attention and then asking to be sent tothe mines, or going to the north-eastern-most part of the city. These ores may be mined giving 17 experience each. However, the ores cannot be sold and cannot be smelted.

Meiyerditch has one lone shop down in the south-western part of town whereTrader Svenlives. He can sell youvyrewatch clothing, which for the whole set costs 1950 coins, orcitizen clothing, which can be bought for 6 coins.
