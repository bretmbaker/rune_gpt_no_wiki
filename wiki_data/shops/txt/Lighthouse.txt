Barbarian Outpost

TheLighthouseis an area north of theBarbarian Outpost, and features prominently in theHorror from the Deepquest. The Lighthouse can only be entered during and after the quest; however, the island itself can be visited prior to starting the quest. Its dungeon is a popular place for players to killdagannothforSlayer.Jossikcan be found upstairs after completing the aforementioned quest. He runs ageneral storeand will provide players withGod books, as well as replace any that are lost.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

The fastest way getting there isfairy ringcodeALP. Players can get there from theBarbarian Outpostby jumping across the northernbasalt rocksthat protrude from the sea. It is possible to slip on the rocks, which results in the player falling into the water, being swept back to shore, and taking up to 10 damage. It is noted that having anAgilitylevel above 35 increases the likelihood of successfully jumping across the rocks. Players seem to have a lot of trouble getting over the rock as the character "fails" to jump over it several times.

Another route of access is via a bridge, which is fixed during the quest. The bridge is located in the south-western part of theFremennik Province. If the bridge has not been fixed, the player can jump across it and gain 1 Agility experience, but failing to cross the bridge will deal anywhere between 1 and 5 damage and grant 0.7 Agility experience.

Besides the fairy ring, there are three teleports that arrive near the Lighthouse:

Agames necklaceor theGrouping teleportto the Barbarian Outpost.Teleport to House, if the player's house is atRellekka.Anenchanted lyreteleport to the entrance to Rellekka.

Features[edit|edit source]

The Lighthouse is the start point of the questHorror from the Deep, and is where most of the quest takes place. It cannot be entered untilLarrissa, who stands outside the Lighthouse, gives the player theLighthouse key. After unlocking the door for the first time, the key is no longer needed.

Ground floor[edit|edit source]

Theground floor[UK]1stfloor[US]has the stairs to the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]and a metal ladder to the basement.

First floor[edit|edit source]

The1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]is the room for the Lighthouse's tender. It contains a bed, bookcase, two sets of drawers, and stairs leading up and down.

Jossikcan be found here after the player rescues him in the quest. He replacesSilasas the keeper of the Lighthouse. Jossik runs ageneral storein this room. Besides the usual items likehammersandrope, the store also sells:

Poison. This isnotweapon poison. Instead, it is a poison that is used in some quests, such asErnest the Chicken.Pestle and mortarsandvials, both of which are used mostly forHerblore.A large variety of alcoholic beverages:brandy,dwarven stout,gin,Greenman's ale,grog,vodka,whiskey, andWizard's mind bomb.

Jossik will replace a player'sdamaged bookorgod bookif it is lost, with collected pages intact. He will also sell a new book for 5,000 coins.

Second floor[edit|edit source]

The2ndfloor[UK]3rdfloor[US]contains the light and its mechanism. The player repairs the mechanism during theHorror from the Deepquest.

The Lighthouse building is difficult to see from the ground, but a better view of it is possible on this floor.

Basement[edit|edit source]

The basement contains the ladder back up, a small pool of water, and a door to the north. Beyond the door is a foyer with a ladder down into the dungeon.

At first, the door is a"strange wall", which the player activates during the quest. Once activated, the wall becomes two one-way doorways. The eastern door is used to enter the foyer from the basement and the western one is used to enter the basement from the foyer.

After the quest, you can re-enter the dungeon by clicking on the piece of blank wall beside the door ("open wall"), since clicking on the door itself will only show a puzzle.

Dungeon[edit|edit source]

The dungeon is a single large chamber. The westernmost part is a pool of water, presumably connecting to the sea outside, while the rest is dry land.

After the quest, the dungeon is crawling with manydagannoth. It is amulti-combat area, and the dagannoth here, although moderately strong, are inaccurate in their attacks and are not as powerful as their levels suggest. The lower level dagannoth shoot spikes at players as a rather poorRangedattack, and the higher level dagannoth attack with a slightly more accurate close-range (Melee) bite. Many dagannoth wander about near the entrance ladder, so players should be prepared for combat as soon as they descend into the dungeon.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Horrors of the deep, and the dagannoth creature and sprite are all references to the short story "Dagon" written by H.P. Lovecraft.The basalt rocks north ofBarbarian Outpostmay be in reference to theGiant's Causewayin Northern Ireland.The Lighthouse is owned by theRuneScape Council, who also employ its keepers.Even though the player builds a walkway to the island, the broken bridge's examine keeps referring to "jumping off" rather than crossing it.
