Type | region



TheKebos Lowlandsare a region located on the continent ofZeah, just west ofGreat Kourend. It is one of the three regions that make up the continent, the other two being the Kingdom of Great Kourend andVarlamore.[1]

The region consists of a rocky mountain known asMount Quidamortemto the south, and a sulphurous volcano known asMount Karuulmto the north. Between these two mountains lies a large piece of land with very fertile soil and theKebos Swamp. The fertile land and the swamp are separated by theRiver Molch, which runs between the two.

Players can travel to the Kebos Lowlands by walking to theBattlefrontnorth-west ofShayzienor by traversing the rocky terrain south-west ofLovakengj. Players can also reach the region by walking past theShayziens' Wall, but this is not recommended unless they are travelling toMount Quidamortem, asaggressivelizardmenare found directly west of the Wall; the aforementioned methods are safer for players seeking to reach the northern part of the region.

History[edit|edit source]

The first arrival[edit|edit source]

Sometime during theGod Wars, before the arrival of refugees that would go on to foundArceuus,LovakengjandPiscarilius, the continent ofZeahwas uninhabited and untouched by the war, until the arrival of aDragonkinnamedKaruulm, who travelled to Mount Karuulm to find a way to lift the Curse ailing his kind[2]without interruptions from his fellow kin.

During his stay in Mount Karuulm, he had managed to createwyrms,drakesandhydras, creatures he had thought of creating but were rejected byKerapac,[3]who preferred to focus on hisdragons.[4]His final creation was theAlchemical Hydra, who he viewed as a failure due to being unable to replicate it.[5]Soon after, he leaves the volcano forMount Quidamortem, where he would go on to create theGreat Olm.[6]

The Tasakaal[edit|edit source]

An unknown amount of time passed following Karuulm's departure fromMount Karuulmafter which threeTzHaar, unable to stand by and wait fortheir masterto restore order and protect the life force of the world,Anima Mundi, made their way to Mount Karuulm from their home withinKaramja Volcano[7]. Once there, they renamed themselves theTasakaaland created theKahlith, their servants, to aid them in keeping life in check by maintaining "the balance":For every death, there must be a life. For every life, there must be a death.Despite this philosophy, they claim to not be servants ofGuthix, whom they call a pretender.

The Great Expedition[edit|edit source]

DuringGreat Kourend's 36th decade (1,050 years ago), King Shayzien VII ordered an expedition to explore the Kebos Lowlands as part of a plan to expand the kingdom's territory. The initial surveying of the region resulted in the discovery ofMount Quidamortem,[8]and a subsequent expedition led by Magnus Rimor was assigned to ascend the mountain and return with details of their findings.[9]However, none returned. Assuming the party perished in the field, the expedition was declared a failure.[10]

However, King Shayzien VII would later use asmall cavewithin the mountain to secretly create an unstable altar which acted as an amplifier for the Dark Altar's power, as well as experimenting on the nativelizardsto create thelizardman, which he would use as his army to rule Kourend asXerica decade later.

Xeric's exile[edit|edit source]

After Xeric's exile from Great Kourend in the 47th decade (940 years ago), Xeric no longer had the Dark Altar's power to sustain his immortality,[11]so he and the rest of his followers travelled west toMount Quidamortem, where his artisanTektonbuilt a massiveunderground complexfor him to use cave's crystals and the magic within them. In addition, the unstable altar he had ordered to be built in thesmall cavewithin the mountain would help maintain his immortality, as it allowed theDark Altar's power to reach places where it normally couldn't by amplifying its power.[12]

During this time, Xeric's experiments on the mountain caused a strange mist to surround it,[13]causing a dramatic change in the flora around the mountain, rotting the lush greenery and causing the open flatlands to become sodden and impassable,[14]creating theKebos Swamp.

Opening the borders[edit|edit source]

Today, nearly 940 years after Xeric's exile, the region remains swarming withlizardmen, who have never ceased in their attempts to reclaim Kourend. Because of this,Shayzienhad closed off the western border of the kingdom[15]until recently, when theShayzien Armysuccessfully pushed back the lizardmen, allowing citizens and adventurers alike to explore the Lowlands.[16]

Soon after reopening the western border,Hosidiusexplorers discovered that the soil in the land just south ofMount Karuulmis extremely fertile,[17]promptingLord Kandur Hosidiusto make a deal with his brother-in-law,Lord Shiro Shayzien, to clear out the lizardmen in the area to build and maintain theFarming Guild.[18]

Because of the proximity of thelizardmenacross theRiver Molch, a detachment ofsergeants,soldiersandrangershave been assigned to the area to guard the farmers in the event of an attack, where they can then quickly call reinforcements from theBattlefront.[19]However, as the lizardmen are focusing their efforts on invadingGreat Kourendjust east of there, none have attempted to cross the River Molch that separates the area from theKebos Swamp.[20]

With the influx of humans arriving on Mount Karuulm, theKahlithhave also begun to engage in small businesses to help the humans with maintaining the balance that they and theirmastersseek to achieve.[21]
