Morytania

Fossil Islandis amembers-only area located north-east ofMorytaniaand unveils a unique environment where players can train a variety of skills. It is an ancient, uncharted island currently being explored by theVarrock Museum.

The island itself is surrounded by seven other smaller islands, though they are currently inaccessible save forLithkren, the island north-west that players visit during the questDragon Slayer II.

In order to reach the island, players must have completed theBone Voyagequest.

Transportation[edit|edit source]

Initially, Fossil Island could only be reached via thebargefrom theDigsite, which is close to theVarrock Teleport.

Digsite pendant[edit|edit source]

The fastest way to travel to Fossil Island is to use adigsite pendant, which will teleport the player near the barge at the Digsite, where they can fast travel to theMuseum Campby speaking to thebarge guard.

The pendant can be used on the southernmoststrange machineinside theHouse on the Hill, north-east of the Museum Camp, to unlock the 'Fossil Island' (or house) teleport option. There is also amagic mushtreeat the house that utilises theMycelium Transportation System; this system of magic mushtrees allows transportation around Fossil Island, but in order to access them, they must be discovered by walking to their locations first and attempting to use them.

Alternate[edit|edit source]

If a digsite pendant is not available, several other options to reach theDigsiteare available.

The fastest way is to use aDigsite teleport scrollwhich teleports players southwest of the barge.

Alternatively,gnome glidertransport to Lemanto Andra, the glider landing site southwest of the barge, can be suitable with easy access to a glider. Players can use aring of duelingto teleport to thePvP Arenato use the glider west of the gem trader inAl Kharid, or travel to theGnome Strongholdvia aroyal seed podafter completion ofMonkey Madness IIto use the glider atop theGrand Tree.

Areas[edit|edit source]

Museum Camp[edit|edit source]

After arriving on Fossil Island, the player will be just west of theMuseum Camp. At first, the camp will not be very useful, but players can utilise theirConstructionskill and some materials to build improvements within the camp. Building the utilities requires ahammer. If you've forgotten a hammer, you may purchase one from the general store.

To build the bank, players will need a hammer, 21Construction,  2oak planks, aniron bar, 5nails.

In total, players will need the following items to build everything:

10oak planks2iron bars25nails1tinderbox2logs3soft clay1bucket2ropes5planks

The list of things to build can be found further below in theMini-Task Listsection. You will also need at least 29Constructionto build everything.

Players can findfossil storagecrates to store anyfossilsfound whilst on the island. There are additional crates scattered around the island as well, and another one is in theVarrock Museumbasement.

Mushroom Forest[edit|edit source]

The north-west section of the island is theMushroom Forest. There are various activities here that allow players to train a variety ofskills. Players can slayancient zygomitesas part of azygomiteSlayer task, track downherbiboarsthroughout the forest, plantteakandmahoganytrees in the threetree patchesin the south-east corner, and calcify fossils in themycelium pool.

In addition, theWyvern Cavecan be found in the Mushroom Forest beneath a trapdoor. Thewyvernswithin can only be slain if players have been assigned Fossil Island wyverns as a Slayer task.

Tar Swamp[edit|edit source]

The south-west section of the island contains a large swamp. Travelling through the swamp requires araketo clear vines in addition to anaxeto chop down thick vines.Sulliuscepmushrooms can be found throughout the swamp, but only one can be chopped down, forcing players to traverse the hostile swamp while avoiding aggressivetar monstersto find the choppable sulliuscep. There is also arubber cap mushroomthat can be used to launch the player next to a Magic Mushtree, but this can inflict up to 50+ damage if the player has not filled the landing pit withmushrooms.

In the southern end of the swamp, players will find thederanged archaeologist, who fights similarly to thecrazy archaeologistfound in theWildernessruins. However, he is much more dangerous, as hisspecial attackcan hit for 56 damage.

Volcano[edit|edit source]

The volcano can be found on the south-east side of the island. Manyash pilescan be found here, along with theVolcanic Mine.

Underwater[edit|edit source]

Beneath the waters of Fossil Island lies a large underwater area that can be accessed by using therowboatat the north-east corner of theMushroom Forest. Travelling out to sea with the rowboat brings the player to a small island with abank chest, where they can then travel back or right-click on the rowboat to enter the underwater area.

Unlike other underwater areas throughout the game, a small bar indicating the player's oxygen level will appear at the top left of the game screen when they enter the area. This bar will continually drain while the player remains underwater; if it runs out, players will drown and reappear at the surface. You can refill your oxygen by collectingpufferfish, which can be consumed to refill your oxygen. However, if the player has afishbowl helmetanddiving apparatusequipped, their oxygen level will stay at 100%. The helmet and apparatus can be safely removed and re-equipped while underwater, and if you have an oxygen level below 100%, it will slowly fill back up once both items are re-equipped.

House on the Hill[edit|edit source]

Located on the north-east side of the island, theHouse on the Hillcan be travelled to by climbing a hill on the south end of theMushroom Forest. Within the house are variousstrange machines, one of which can enchant adigsite pendantto allow players toteleportdirectly to the house. Additionally, one of the fourmagic mushtreeson the island can be found here, allowing quick access to other parts of the island by teleporting here via digsite pendant and then using the magic mushtree to travel.

In the basement of the house, accessible via a trapdoor in the south-east corner, there are severalstone chestswith a search option. Searching the stone chest will ask for anumulite. After inserting the numulite, the chest will give the search option to insert 100 numulites into the hole. The chests have a chance of having nothing happen, dealing damage, or giving one of various notes. The notes can be added to the player'sFossil Island note book. In addition, behind the ladder, a pile of books can be searched to obtain anancient diary.

Mini-Task List[edit|edit source]

Just outside theFossil Island General Storein theMuseum Campis anotice boardthat lists things to do on Fossil Island. These are simple mini-tasks that are meant to introduce the player to the various content the island has to offer. The list is split into four sections: the Museum Camp, the Northern Reaches, the Southern Swamps, and the Mountainous East.

Players who have completed a section of the list can speak toPeter, who can be found panning south-west of the notice board, for a reward. Players who complete the list for the Museum Camp and Northern Reaches will receive 10unidentified small fossils(5 per section), and completing the list for the Southern Swamps and Mountainous East will give 10unidentified medium fossils(5 per section).
