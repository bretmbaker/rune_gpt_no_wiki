TheFarming Guildis amembers-only guild located within theKebos Lowlandsjust north of theKebos Swamp. The guild is a large greenhouse separated into three tiers, with each tier requiring an increasingFarminglevel to enter (boostsmay be used for all tiers). To enter the guild, a minimum Farming level of 45 is required. This will take you into the central area of the guild. The beginner section of the guild (the eastern wing) is also already accessible from level 45 onwards, but the intermediate and advanced tier requires level 65 and 85 Farming to enter respectively.

The guild was founded byJane, the guildmaster, along with other fellowHosidiusfarmers after theShayzien Armycleared out thelizardmenin the surrounding area.[1]Despite the risks of the lizardmen just acrossRiver Molch, the discoveries made here, along with the heat coming fromMount Karuulmjust north-east, allows the guild to grow flora that would never survive inGreat Kourend's climate,[2]such as theHesporiand thecelastrus tree.

Features[edit|edit source]

Farming contracts[edit|edit source]

Because the guild needs to rotate the crops they're growing to stop the soil from tiring due to a lack of nutrients,Guildmaster Janecan assignfarming contractsthat require the player to grow certain crops within the Farming Guild. Players who complete them are awarded withseed packs, which contain an assortment of seeds and can includeHespori,celastrus, andredwood seeds.

There are three tiers of contracts available, with each tier being restricted based on their Farming level and their level of access within the Farming Guild. Boosts may be used to accept a farming contract you are below the level requirement for.

Beginner tier[edit|edit source]

The beginner tier comprises the guild's main area and east wing, requiring 45 Farming to enter.

By the entrance to the guild, Jane, the guildmaster, provides background on the guild and assigns farming contracts.

Three shops are available in the central area:Allanna's Farming Shop(which sellsempty plant potsalongsidefilled ones),Amelia's Seed Shop, and theGarden Centreshop. Aspadeandbucketspawn can also be found here.

Converting this bin from normal compost tosupercompostrequires only one dose ofcompost potion, but converting it toultracompostrequires twice the normal amount ofvolcanic ash(50 instead of 25). This bin can be filled while simultaneously harvesting a nearby allotment.

The intermediate tier comprises the guild's west wing, requiring 65 Farming to enter.

A boost can be used to enter. Once inside, dropping to below 65 will not result in your expulsion.

The following patches can be found within the west wing of the guild:

AMaster Farmercan be found here for players topickpocket.

Lastly, twosnowy knightbutterflies can be caught within the west wing.

The Hespori patch, accessible via thecave entrance, is a patch where players with 65 Farming can plantHespori seeds. These are randomly obtained when harvesting plants throughout Gielinor or rewarded from farming contracts. The Hespori plant cannot become diseased, and therefore does not need to be watered, composted, or protected by a farmer.

Once the patch has fully grown, which is indicated by the flower behind the cave sprouting open or by going into the cave and checking, theHesporican be fought as a solodemi-boss. Killing the Hespori boss grants Farming experience and seeds, including the uniquewhite lilyandanima seeds. It can also drop thebottomless compost bucket, which can hold up to 10,000 compost of any kind and doubles any compost added to it. In addition, defeating the Hespori has a chance to give theTanglerootpet.

TheHesporifight is instanced but has an item reclaim service; see the boss page for more information.

The anima patch is a patch where players with 76 Farming can plantanima seeds, which can only be obtained as drops from the Hespori. Players can speak toFelfiz Yaryusto ask about their effects.

Unlike other seeds, these plants are active as soon as they are planted, and slowly wither and die through their various growth stages. The plants will last approximately 3.5 days, and require planting again to restore their benefits. An in-game message will state when the plants die, and they can also be checked via theGeomancyLunar spell.

Planting a seed in the anima patch here has worldwide effects on all farming patches throughoutGielinor. There are three types of anima seeds:

Attas seed: Grows an Attas plant, which increases the yield of farming patches.Iasor seed: Grows an Iasor plant, which decreases the chance of farming patches from becomingdiseased.Kronos seed: Grows a Kronos plant, which provides a chance for farming patches to skip a growth stage, effectively making them grow faster.

Advanced tier[edit|edit source]

The advanced tier comprises the guild's north wing, requiring 85 Farming to enter. A secondbankcan be found here, close to a fountain and theTool Leprechaun.

A boost can be used to enter. Once inside, dropping to below 85 will not result in your expulsion. However, logging out while in the advanced tier will cause the player to be moved to the central area.

The farmers here will look over all patches in this area, with a singleTool Leprechaunpresent.
