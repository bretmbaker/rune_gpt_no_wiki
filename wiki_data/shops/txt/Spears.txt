Spearsare fast-speed two-handedstabbingweaponsused inmeleecombat. They are obtained from eithermonster drops, purchasing from players, orsmithingon the special anvil south of theBarbarian OutpostorBarbarian Village. Most spears can bepoisonedwith normal weapon poisons orkarambwan paste.

Although they can only be used to train controlled and defensive attacks, spears are still arguably the most flexible weapons in the game, as they are the only weapon besides theHastato useStab,Crush, andSlashattack styles, and their speed gives them damage per second close to that ofscimitars. However, spears are rarely used as they do not excel in any particular style and other two-handed weapons, such as thetwo-handed swordand thehalberd, have higher attack bonuses despite being much slower. Their flexibility can be useful for saving inventory space during theSpirits of the Elidquestwhich requires that all three meleeattack typesbe used.

Each attack style of the spear, except for Defensive, is Controlled and gives shared melee experience (Attack,Strength, andDefence). All styles also giveHitpointsexperience.

All spears have an attack speed of 4game ticks, except theLeaf-bladed spearandGuthan's warspearwhich have a speed of 5, and theBone spear, which has a speed of 6. This makes the spear the fastest two-handed weapon type in the game, tied withclaws.

AnIron spearor better is required for the completion ofTai Bwo Wannai Trio; although completing the quest is a partial requirement for crafting them, you can use ones purchased from NPC shops, the GE, or monster drops.
