[Shop: General_store]

Thegeneral storeis a type of shop placed in many locations inRuneScape. Unlikespecialty shops, general stores usually accept all tradeable items, making them a useful place to sell miscellaneous goods that do not have a dedicated store. General stores are identified on themapby a poticon. Many general stores have both ashop keeperand ashop assistant, both of which can be used to access the shop stock.

Staples[edit|edit source]

Each general store carries a few commonly used, inexpensive items. It rarely runs out of these items for long, as they tend to restock quickly. The following is the most conventional inventory for a general store:

PotJugEmpty jug packShearsBucketBowlCake tinTinderboxChiselHammer

Most general stores available in thefree-to-playmap area also carry the following:

Newcomer mapSecurity book

Other common items for the general store include:

RopeKnifeVial of waterPestle and mortarCandleUnlit torchCooked meatBronze pickaxeBronze axeIron axeSpade

Anything goes[edit|edit source]

In addition to regular stock, players may sell any tradeable item to a store, so the general store in each town will often have a stock of the local specialty, though any item can be sold to any location. A player can buy any item in the general store that they want if they have enough money. Bargains may sometimes be found from players unaware of typically higher street prices, or in too much of a hurry to find a buyer.

Sell prices[edit|edit source]

When selling to a general store, the price when it has no stock of that item is the low alchemy value, i.e. 40% of the item's in-gamevalue(the item's stock price when buying from aspecialty shop). The minimum price the player receives for selling any item is 10% of the item'svalue, so 25% of the item's initial (low alchemy/general store) price.

Every overstocked item causes the selling price to decrease by 3% of the item's value. This causes the minimum price (10% of the item'svalue) to be reached after the store is overstocked with 10 of that item.

For example,tiarahas avalueof 100coinsand a Low Alch price of 40 coins so the first tiara is sold for that. The lowest price that tiaras go for is 10% of item'svaluewhich is 10 coins. Each sold tiara decreases the price by 3% of 100 coins = 3 coins.

Sell price=(40−3×Min(Stock, 10))100×Value

Note:The general stores in theWilderness Bandit Camp(Bandit Duty Free General Store), and inRogues' Den(Martin Thwait's Lost and Found) will buy items at a high alchemy price, which is 60% of itsvalue, or 150% of the price offered in normal general stores. The general stores inWest Ardougne(West Ardougne General Store),Pollnivneach(Pollnivneach general store), and theLegends' Guild(Legends Guild General Store) will buy items at 55% of theirvalue, or 137.5% of the price offered in normal general stores.

Buy prices[edit|edit source]

When buying items from a general store, the price starts at 127% of the item'svaluewith 1 item in stock and decreases by 3% with each extra item stocked until it reaches 30% of the item'svalueat 34 items in stock.
