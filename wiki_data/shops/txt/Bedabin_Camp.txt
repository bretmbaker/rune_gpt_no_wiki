Bandit Camp

TheBedabin Campis a very small nomad camp south-west ofAl Kharidand theKalphite Lair. It is visited during theTourist Trapquestand is the starting point of theDesert Treasure Iquest. The Bedabin Camp is also a destination that can be flown to using theMagic carpettransportation system from theShantay Pass. Alternatively,fairy ringcodeBIQwill teleport the player to the entrance of the Kalphite Lair, north-east of the camp.

The Bedabins are known as a peaceful tribe of desert dwellers, and are often nicknamed "Tenti's" because they live in tents. They are renowned for surviving in harsh desert climates, and also for growing the renownedBedabin ambrosia, or Tenti pineapple. The pineapples are grown in a secret location in order to stop thieves from raiding them.

Besides these quests, the Bedabin Camp is rarely visited by players, mostly as part ofTreasure Trails, or as a stopover on their way to theBandit Camp, a very popular training place amongst high levelled players. It is inhabited byBedabin Nomadswho sell certain desert supplies andBedabin Nomad Fighters. Apart from the many desert supplies merchants in the camp, there is little else to do except killBedabin Nomad Fighters.

Theanvilin this tent can only be used during theTourist Trapquest in makingdartsand is not allowed to be used after the quest. Fletching somedragon dartswhile in the camp is a requirement for theElite Desert Diary.
