Minigames[edit|edit source]

Animation room[edit|edit source]

This room, created byShanomi, is located on theground floor[UK]1stfloor[US]next to the entrance hall. This is the most commonly played minigame forwarrior guild tokens, as it requires little attention and is rather fast compared to the other activities.

To start, players must activate amagical animatorwith a set of metal armour (full helm,platelegs, and aplatebody) in their inventory. Trimmed or God-aligned sets do not work. The armour will then come to life and begin attacking the player. When defeated, theanimated armourdrops a certain amount of tokens and possibly the equipment used to create it, depending on its armour type.

Animated armour is immune topoisonandvenom, and must be fought in melee combat. It will despawn if not defeated within five minutes. Should this happen, or should the player die against one, the equipment may be retrieved from Shanomi.

Metal | Combat Lvl | HP | Tokens | Tokens/HP | Recyclable[1]

 | Bronze | 11 | 10 | 5 | 0.500 | 72.9%

 | Iron | 23 | 20 | 10 | 0.500 | 90%

 | Steel | 46 | 40 | 15 | 0.375 | 90%

 | Black | 69 | 60 | 20 | 0.333 | 100%

 | Mithril | 92 | 80 | 25 | 0.313 | 100%

 | Adamant | 113 | 99 | 30 | 0.303 | 100%

 | Rune | 138 | 120 | 40 | 0.333 | 100%

It is the most efficient to useblack armourin this minigame. Of all non-degradable animated armour, it shares the highest token-to-hitpoint ratio while being the easiest to defeat.

Dummy room[edit|edit source]

This minigame, hosted byAjjat, is also located next to the entrance hall. There are no required items for this activity. It tests players' reflexes with dummies that each require a different combat or attack style to be hit. Players can look at the poster outside of the dummy room to know what style to use for each dummy. Each dummy correctly hit will reward players with 15Attackexperience and 2warrior guild tokens.

There are sevendummies, covering all four combat styles and all three melee attack styles. Having means to cover all combat and attack styles can come in handy. For example, alongswordwill be able to hit six dummies, while unarmed combat can be used as crush damage for the seventh dummy.

Given the fact there are no single weapons that allow covering all different combat and attack styles, at least two weapons are required to be able to successfully hit all dummies. However, instead of switching between theInventoryand thatCombat Optionsin order to cover all 7 dummy styles, it is also possible to set up an inventory consisting of 7 different weapon types, setting their attack style to the required attack style for the given dummy. Aligning the weapons with the orientation of the dummies in the room will make it easier to switch to that weapon, attack, and switch back to a placeholder weapon in order to maintain alignment.

Below is an example setup to easily switch between the dummies, but many different setups work equally well.

Catapult room[edit|edit source]

This activity is located on the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]next to the stairwell. To start, players may speak withGamfredto obtain a two-handeddefensive shield, which can only be equipped in this minigame. With the shield equipped, players need to block ammunition fired at them from the catapult by selecting the appropriate defensive style from their inventory. Each time players defend successfully, they will receive 10Defenceexperience and 1 token. The catapult fires every 8 ticks (4.8 seconds), which equates to only 750 tokens and 7,500 defence experience per hour.

Shot put room[edit|edit source]

This room can be found east of the catapult room. Players require aStrengthlevel of at least 50 to play this minigame, needed to pass through aHeavy door. To start, they have to pick up a shot put from thepileand select one of three throwing styles. The farther a successful shot put is thrown, the moreStrengthexperience and warrior guild tokens are earned. Rarely, the player fails the shot and has it either drop on their toe, taking one point of damage in the process, or hit the referee outside the cage.

Aside from the throwing style and the player's Strength level, there are several more factors that weigh in the distance of a shot. See the calculator page for more information.

For the most optimal rate ofguild tokensin this minigame, players should use the22lb shotwith the 'Standing throw' style at 100%run energy, recovering the energy used in-between every throw.

Jimmy's challenge[edit|edit source]

The last minigame can be found in a room adjacent to the shot put room. Here, players need to take off any headgear and have both hands empty. They have to pick up akegand balance it on their head. Another one can then be balanced on top of it, stacking up to five in total. Players will passively earnStrengthexperience and tokens for every barrel on their head, at the cost ofenergy. Dropping the barrels deals up to four damage to the player, and the chance of this happening increases as the player's energy decreases. Barrels disappear from a player's head if they walk out of the room.

It is possible to drink potions to restore energy whilst balancing the barrels.

Cyclopes[edit|edit source]

Top floor[edit|edit source]

On the2ndfloor[UK]3rdfloor[US]of the Warriors' Guild is a room filled with level 56 and 76cyclopes, from which players can gaindefendersup torune. It is guarded byKamfreena. Any yet unrewarded tokens can be claimed from her.

Players need to carry at least 100warrior guild tokensto enter this room. Ten tokens are spent upon entering the room, and another ten every minute inside. If the player runs out of tokens, they have a minute left before being teleported outside of the room.

No tokens are required for players that wear the level 99Attack cape.

Players have to earn the defenders in order. Without any defender, they can only receive thebronze defenderas drop.Every time the player obtains a defender, they have to leave the room and re-enter it to be able to receive the next defender!Each defender that can be found in this room has a drop chance of 1/50. Cyclopes must be fought inmeleecombat.

Defenders on the top floor are found in this order:

# | Defender

1 |  | Bronze defender

2 |  | Iron defender

3 |  | Steel defender

4 |  | Black defender

5 |  | Mithril defender

6 |  | Adamant defender

7 |  | Rune defender

Basement[edit|edit source]

Once the player has obtained therune defender, they will be able to access the room in the basement where level 106cyclopesroam. These cyclopes have a 1/100 chance to drop the final upgrade of the defenders; thedragon defender.

The basement entrance is a ladder found just west outside of the back door of the guild.Lorelaiguards the cyclopes here. She can also reward any unclaimed tokens. The rune defender will no longer be required once the player has shown it to her once or entered the cyclops room for the first time. The same rules as on the top floor apply here, meaning tokens are required and used up by anyone not wearing theAttack cape.
