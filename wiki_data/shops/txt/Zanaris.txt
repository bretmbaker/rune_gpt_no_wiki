Cooking[edit|edit source]

There is a wheat field and a nearby windmill, so flour is easy to make here. There are also several fountains for collection ofwater, though these are by no means the closest water-sources to a bank in the game. There is also acooking rangeto the south of the bank.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Using theNew Official Client's expanded draw distance, it is possible to see the lower level of theEvil Chicken's Lairfrom the southern edge of Zanaris. This is because Zanaris, like all areas not on the overworld map, is actually located on a section of the world map north of theWildernesswhich houses all of the underground and other non-surface areas of the game.TheZanaris choirwill follow players into random events.The city, in all likelihood, is deep underground, but this is unconfirmed, as Zanaris is also the name of Gielinor's moon. This was most likely a remnant of information from during the early days of RuneScape, and before it was known to be the moon.[4]
