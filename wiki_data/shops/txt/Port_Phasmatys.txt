Port Phasmatys(Jagex:/fæzˈmætɪs/faz-MAT-iss) is a small coastal town located on the north-eastern coast ofMorytania.

The town is populated by ghosts, and aghostspeak amuletorMorytania legs 2is needed to talk to the majority of the inhabitants. The town is featured heavily in theGhosts Ahoyquest. Entry to the town requires twoecto-tokensor the completion of Ghosts Ahoy for free passage. Alternatively, acharter shipcan be used to bypass the ecto-token requirement before completion of the quest.

The town is especially notable for theEctofuntusdirectly north of its gates, and itsfurnace, which is among the closest to abank.
It is possible to travel toMos Le'HarmlessandDragontooth Islandfrom the docks, as well as accessing thecharter ships.

History[edit|edit source]

Port Phasmatys dates back to theFourth Ageand was founded byhumansettlers, who had travelled toMorytania, which at that time was not considered more dangerous than other places around Gielinor.Lord Lowerniel Drakan, the ruler of Morytania, took notice of the humans settling in his kingdom and demanded that they paid blood tithes to thevampyres. When the people of Port Phasmatys refused, Lord Drakan began to plot an invasion. Knowing that they had no chances against an army of vampyres the people of Port Phasmatys turned toNecrovarus, a powerful mage from theEastern Lands. Necrovarus constructed theEctofuntusand used it to erect a magical barrier around the town. The plan was successful and the vampyres were unable to invade and retreated. The people of the town continued aiding Necrovarus in maintaining the Ectofuntus, but soon consequences began to emerge. When a citizen died they were unable to move on to the afterlife, and their ghosts remained stuck in Port Phasmatys. This was Necrovarus' intention and eventually there were no living inhabitants left, only ghosts and the town fell into disrepair. Lord Drakan gave up trying to take over Port Phasmatys as there was no longer any blood to harvest and as such the town was of no use to the vampyric society. Although Port Phasmatys was mostly abandoned, sailors, traders and pirates still occasionally visit the town. Any visitors to the town are demanded to pay a tribute to the Ectofuntus.

Notable features[edit|edit source]

Ectofuntus[edit|edit source]

After starting theGhosts Ahoyquest, you can worship theEctofuntusto receive 4 timesPrayerexperiencefor every bone. Completing the quest will help immensely as you can use theEctophialto teleport back and forth, and bank at the town if needed. Players who have completed various levels of theMorytania Diarywill be able to claim slime and bonemeal daily fromRobin Hoodin exchange for bones, as well as being able to teleport to the slime pit several times a day.

Collect slime- take empty buckets and enter the trapdoor near the Ectofuntus, and travel down the stairs. There is anAgilityshortcuthere that will shorten the journey considerably. At the bottom of the stairs is a pool of slime, just use your empty buckets with them. Buckets of slime can also be purchased fromTrader Stan's Trading Post, located on the docks next to everycharter ship.Crush bones- take your bones and some empty pots and go up the stairs near the Ectofuntus. Use the bone grinder to grind the bones and collect the contents in the pots.Worship the Ectofuntus- you should now have buckets of slime and pots ofbonemealin yourinventory. Just click on the Ectofuntus to worship it, and receive your Prayer experience. You will need to talk to the disciples when the Ectofuntus is full to receive some ecto-tokens. You can then worship again.

Bank[edit|edit source]

There is abankin Port Phasmatys to the south-east, serviced byghost bankers. Trying to use the bank without aghostspeak amuletwill always yield a message that, despite of the bankers' inability to talk to the player, they understand that the player wishes to use the bank after a "series of hand gestures." After the player dismisses the message, they can use the bank. This message does not appear if the player has the ghostspeak amulet equipped, so it is recommended that they equip it when using the bank so as to save a few seconds.

Ecto-tokens[edit|edit source]

Many of the ghosts require payment inecto-tokens, which is the currency of the town, though the shop still usescoins. See theEctofuntus guideabove or theGhosts Ahoyquestfor a guide to obtaining ecto-tokens. Players will also need 20 ecto-tokens duringAnimal Magnetism.

Date | Changes

3 December2015(update) | The one tick delay present when you used bank booths rather than bankers in Port Phasmatys has been removed – on top of this, a bank booth in Port Phasmatys was not giving a message for players not using an amulet of ghostspeak; this has been fixed.
