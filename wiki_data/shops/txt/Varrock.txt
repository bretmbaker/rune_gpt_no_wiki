Varrock(Jagex pronunciation:vah-ROCK) is thecapitalof the kingdom ofMisthalin. It is one of the largest cities inOld School RuneScape, and the largest city available tofree players. In addition to being popular due to its proximity to theWilderness, the city hosts the massiveGrand Exchange, through which players can trade any item they wish, and features in many of thequeststhroughout the game.

Varrock can be entered from all sides, and each entrance has non-aggressivelevel 21guardssurrounding it. The city is safe for all players, although care should be taken when coming fromLumbridgethrough the south entrance, as there are aggressive level 7 and 20dark wizards.

History[edit|edit source]

Prior to holding its current name, the city was known asAvarrocka, and came into being in the year 700 of theFourth Age. During this time, the races that had survived theGod Warsbegan to compete for land without the direct aid ofgods, and most of humanity lived in small nomadic tribes. One of these tribes, looking to settle in the forest, discovered a young boy during their travels who was about two years of age. The boy stood nearly a foot taller than most his age, and was already quite strong; the wanderers, taking the boy's strength as a good omen, chose that place to made a camp.

Ten years since the initial settlement, the baby remained unnamed, and theeldersdecided to send the child on a quest to find one. The child eventually stumbled upon a tribe ofgoblinsthat planned to attack the settlement. When the goblins saw him, they attacked, screaming "arrav," a word from their language. The goblins were defeated by the boy, who returned to Avarrocka and recounted the tale, and was thenceforth known as "Arrav." AsArravgrew, so did Avarrocka; this causedZemouregal, a powerfulZamorakianMahjarratnecromancer, to set his sights on the city.

Attempting to ward off Zemouregal, Arrav sought outa mythical shield. During his journey to find this shield, he travelled across the realm, but upon his return, he found Avarrocka burned to the ground. However, the city was able to rebuild. About a century into Avarrocka's existence, however, Zemouregalinvadedwith an army of zombies. While his army was slain, the battle cost Arrav his life, and Zemouregal retreated with an undead version of Arrav. Shortly after, the people of Avarrocka began expanding, eventually forming the first human nation,Misthalin, and later becoming a monarchy.

As centuries passed, creatures fromMorytaniaattacked Misthalin. In a great battle,seven priestly warriorseventually defeated them and blessed theRiver Salve, making it impassable to creatures following Zamorak. Not all was peaceful for Varrock, however; the fabled shield that Arrav used to save the city was eventually stolen by the notoriousPhoenix Gang, who wouldlater split in two, with the Phoenix gangtaking over much of the residential districtof the city, and the Black Arm Ganghiding in the city's industrial section. Ayoung adventurerwas eventually able to retreive the shield and later use it to defend offZamouregal's second attempt at the city, but it's anyone's guess when the evil necromancer may return...

It is not exactly known when Avarrocka was renamed to Varrock. Some, such as the barbarians, still call it Avarrocka; other languages have their own name for the city, such as thegnomes, who refer to it as Lemanto Andra ("Man City").
