TheKourend Castleis a large castle found in the centre ofGreat Kourend, its courtyard directly flowing into the district ofKingstown. As Great Kourend is a currently ruled by theKourend Council, there is no king that rules here, even though the castle appears to be furnished for royalty; this is because the last king that ruled Great Kourend,King Kharedst IV, ruled until the 139th decade (about 20 years ago).

In the context of Kourend's long history, the castle was constructed only relatively recently, as it first opened during the reign of King Kharedst the Builder, some time after the conclusion of theWar of the Five Housesin the 123rd decade.[1]While it is not explicitly stated whom in the line of Kharedst the title of 'the Builder' was attributed to, it is possible to make a reasonable inference with regard to his identity based on a letter addressed toJonathanpublished in thePostbag from the Hedge. In his response, he mentions a census conducted by King Kharedst the Builder, containing "countless records of mothers without sons or husbands", which in his estimation provides "fascinating insight into life before and after the War of the Five Houses".[2]The conclusion that could be drawn from this document is that King Kharedst the Builder came to power immediately following the War of the Five Houses, meaning he would have been the first of his line,King Kharedst I.

The castle acts as a diplomatic hub, attracting ambassadors and business representatives, such as theKnight of Varlamore. With the inhabitants of the mainland beginning to travel to Great Kourend, this may extend to rulers found in major kingdoms such asAsgarnia,MisthalinandKandarinin the future.

Throughout the castle,Shayzien guardsandHead Guardscan be found. The western entrance's portcullis is closed, heavily guarded, and contains a large arsenal of ballistae, spear walls, gabion defences and barrels containing swords and bows.
