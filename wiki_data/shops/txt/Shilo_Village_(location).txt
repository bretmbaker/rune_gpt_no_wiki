Shilo Villageis a village onKaramja. It is only accessible to players that have completed theShilo Village Quest.

Training spots[edit|edit source]

There are several excellent areas to trainskillsin Shilo Village:

Bank[edit|edit source]

There is abankin Shilo Village, which players often use due to its proximity to the furnace.

Gem mine[edit|edit source]

In northern Shilo Village there are 7gem rocks. If a player mines these rocks, they shall get ageminstead of anore. Players mining gems here may obtain precious (sapphire,emerald,ruby, anddiamond) or semiprecious (opal,jade, andred topaz) gems. Because a chargedamulet of gloryincreases the chance of obtaining gems while mining, wearing a charged amulet of glory sharply increases the speed of mining gem rocks. Players earn 65Miningexperienceper rock mined.

An additional underground section of the gem mine, containing 48 more rocks and abank deposit box, is unlocked if the player has completed the MediumKaramja Diary.

This area is popular among many players because here they can train bothMiningandCrafting(by cutting gems) at the same time.

Furnace[edit|edit source]

The Shilo Villagefurnaceis directly across from thebank, which makes it a popular furnace for players smelting large quantities oforesintobars. This furnace is the closest furnace to a bank in the game, however a disadvantage is thatYohnusrequires 20coinsfor each use, but players can put coins into a coffer to keep a fullinventoryof ore. The next closest furnace isPrifddinas, 1 tile farther away, requiresSong of the Elvescompletion, but needs no extra payment. After completing the eliteKaramja Diary,Yohnuswill no longer charge the player to use the furnace.

Fishing spots[edit|edit source]

There are fourfishing spotsin Shilo Village. At these fishing spots,fly fishing rodsandfeatherscan be used to luretroutandsalmon, orfishing rodsandfishing baitcan be used to catchpike. Power fly fishing in Shilo Village is considered to be one of the faster ways to trainFishing. This method involves buying large amounts of feathers on theGrand Exchangeor from the easternfishing storeand then catching trout and salmon from the centre river. This fish can either bedroppedor stored in the southern bank, or the gem minedeposit chest. The raw fish can then be sold for a small profit on the Grand Exchange.

There is anAgilityshortcutacross the village river that requires level 32 Agility. This shortcut lowers the time needed to reach fishing spots on the other side of the river if they move.
