Prifddinas(Jagex:/prɪvˈθiːnəs/prive-THEE-nuss[1][a]) is the city of theelvesand the capital city ofTirannwn. Located just north ofIsafdar, the city is the oldest surviving settlement onGielinor, being created in theFirst Age. In order to enter the city, the questSong of the Elvesmust be completed.

While outside Prifddinas, it will appear as if there's nothing there when looking from outside the city walls. This is revealed byBaxtorianto be one of the security measures put in place during theGod Wars.[2]

Features[edit|edit source]

Tower of Voices[edit|edit source]

TheTower of Voicesis found in the centre of the city, and is named as such because in the Tower, it is said that the elves can speak directly to one of the fragments of their goddess, Seren, who chose to shatter herself rather than be forced to leave Gielinor when the Edicts of Guthix were put in place following the God Wars.

History[edit|edit source]

Initial settlement[edit|edit source]

Prifddinas was constructed by the elves in theFirst Ageafter they arrived inGielinorfromTarddiad, their homeworld, through theWorld GatebySeren, their crystalline goddess, andGuthix, the god of balance.[3]The elves settled inTirannwn, a large wooded area west of theGalarpos Mountains, a mountain range that isolated them from the rest of the continent. The eightElven Clansconstructed their city in a clearing north of theIsafdarforest, where she had already created theTower of Voices.[4]

Seren then provided a special seed for each of the eight clans, telling them that they should be planted in the centre of each of their districts. Doing so, these seeds grew into the towers that can be seen today near the edges of the city.[5]

God Wars and Seren's departure[edit|edit source]

During the remainder of the First andSecond Age, Prifddinas would remain isolated from the rest of the world, thanks to theGalarpos Mountainseast of Tirannwn making it difficult for others to cross. However, during theThird Age, theGod Warsbegan raging across the mountains. TheAmlodd Clan, fearing that the armies of the gods may eventually reach the gates of Prifddinas, builtThe Gauntletto help train the elves into the finest warriors and survivalists.[6]

During this time, a demon namedZalcanoeventually made her way to Tirannwn in search of her brother,Skotizo, who killed his expedition team after obtaining an ancient artefact within theKaramjan Templethat was intended to be delivered toZamorak.[7]The elves initially feared that she would be the first of many, but soon found out she was working alone[8]and was under a curse laid by Zamorak that turned her into stone.[9]With the help of theIthellandAmlodd Clans, she was captured for theTrahaearn Clanto study her, albeit with many casualties.[10]

Following the end of the God Wars, theEdicts of Guthixwere put in place, which banished the warring younger gods from Gielinor.Guthixthen visited Seren, who conceded that she was unable to depart from her followers,[11]as doing so would lead to their death: this is due to the Song of Creation, created before the elves' arrival on Gielinor, which inexplicably tied the souls of the elves to Seren and prevented Seren from departing from the elves for prolonged periods, as doing so would lead to illness and eventual death of the elves.[12]

Unable to part from her followers, Seren exploded into a shower of crystals, leaving the elves without Seren's guidance for the first time in thousands of years.[13]Crystals of Seren were left scattered across Tirannwn, which allowed the elves to remain alive, though they were still unaware of Seren's unintended curse.

The Break Out[edit|edit source]

When theFourth Agecommenced, The Break Out occurred amongst the elves and a pass over the mountain range,Arandar, was built.[14]Many travelled east, exploring the lands that are nowKandarin. Spearheaded by the legendary KingBaxtorian, the expedition formed non-aggression pacts with thehumansandgnomesin the area,[15]although they failed to form treaties with theBandosiansdue to a civil war between them taking place.[16]Soon, the elves permanently settled in the newly acquired area, marking the creation of the first major elven settlement outside Prifddinas.

With Baxtorian's kingdom secured, it was decided that theCadarn Clan, who were a clan of skilled warriors and hunters, should be the first to settle in the eastern realm;[17]the others followed suit soon afterwards after seeing how much wealth was coming over Arandar.[18]Within a few decades of The Break Out, the elves had created many settlements and trade agreements between the gnomes and humans.[19]

The Great Divide[edit|edit source]

In Year 1930 of the Fourth Age, due to the absence of theCadarn Clanand the other settlers, theIorwerth Clan, under the command ofLord Iorwerth, betrayed the other clans and began brutally slaughtering thousands of elves, taking full control of Prifddinas and theTower of Voices.[20]Once all contact with the city was lost, and the gates of the Arandar mountain pass no longer accessible,[21]King Baxtorian called an emergency council and decided to send a scouting party of five to Tirannwn through theUnderground Pass.[22]Only one elf,Adwr Cadarn, returned to report the civil war.[23]

In an attempt to restore peace, Baxtorian launched a campaign to liberate Prifddinas from Lord Iorwerth. The elves attempted to recapture the city, which ended disastrously in 1935 with many Cadarn dead.[24]This left the few survivors stranded inIsafdar(notablyLletya, a small, hidden village the refugees erected), where they fought as rebels.

Despite this, King Baxtorian was able to safely evacuate the elven clan leaders from the city, who convened in theGrand Libraryto perform a ritual to revert the city into a crystal seed,[25]forcing Lord Iorwerth to settle in a camp outside of its walls.[26]The elven clan leaders then went their separate ways, giving Baxtorian vague hints of their whereabouts should Prifddinas be ready to be restored.[27]

Prifddinas' Regrowth[edit|edit source]

In 169 of theFifth Age, the rebel elves, led byArianwyn, asked a humanadventurerwho'd found their way to Tirannwn and had been tricked byLord IorwerthandKing Lathasto investigate the activities of themournersinWest Ardougne. This led the adventurer to the long-forgottenTemple of Light, whose safeguard they restored to stop thePrifddinas Death Guard.

After the execution of King Lathas and expelling the mourners from West Ardougne, the adventurer andElenawere captured by the Iorwerth elves and brought totheir campto be taken prisoner; however, Arianwyn and the rebel elves appeared to rescue the two.

Lord Iorwerth will reveal that he lied to King Lathas to access West Ardougne to reach the Temple of Light to revive Seren.[28]Arianwyn refutes this, believing Seren to be dead; Lord Iorwerth thought the same until he managed to break one of the seals in theGrand Library, where he discovered a part of Seren remains trapped within the Temple.[29]He will let the rebels go, believing they could be of use in their plans while they are none the wiser.

Returning toLletya, it is decided that the adventurer and Arianwyn will investigate theWaterfall Dungeonto see whether KingBaxtorianleft anything behind that would explain more about the fragment of Seren. Upon solving a riddle he left behind, the statue of Baxtorian is discovered to be Baxtorian himself, who sealed himself in stone. Returning to Lletya, Baxtorian believes there may be a way to enter the Grand Library via the use of a specially made potion and bypassing the city walls, which have been enchanted so that only Iorwerth elves and their allies can enter; Baxtorian believes Lord Amlodd, an expert in magic, would be able to break the spell.

The adventurer is then assigned to search for the remaining clan elders. After findingLord AmloddandLady Trahaearn, the adventurer is chosen to enter the Grand Library to discover what Lord Iorwerth is planning. The player discovers the broken seal, which proves that he was telling the truth, and proceeds the break the other eight seals, discovering the consequences of Seren's Song of Creation, and her attempts to reverse the curse she had unintentionally placed on her elves, with the darkest parts of her being combined with death energy from theDeath Altar. Unsuccessful, she sealed this part of her in the temple, adding an additional layer of protection in the form of anorb of light, which is found onGorlah, a shrine north of the city.[30]

Reporting back at Lletya, everyone will be shocked by the revelations; Arianwyn will then ask Baxtorian to temporarily lead.Ysgawynwill search for the orb of light on Gorlah, while the adventurer searches forLord CrwysandLady Hefin. It is discovered that the Iorwerth had already claimed the orb of light, and was promptly recovered by the adventurer untilIestin Edern, who has been secretly acting as an informant for Ysgawyn, informs that Lord Iorwerth has discovered Lletya via a traitor among the rebel elves, and told him how to find the village.

During the attack on Lletya, Baxtorian is forced to return the orb of light and it is discovered that Arianwyn was the traitor, who turned once he discovered that Lord Iorwerth truly wished to return Seren,[31]and had informed Lord Iorwerth of the entrance into the Temple of Light. After the Iorwerth leave, Baxtorian sends the adventurer to seekLady IthellandLady Meilyr, who both travel to the Underground Pass.

What remains of the rebel elves are sent to the dwarven camp in the Underground Pass to defend the entrance to the Temple of Light. Despite all their efforts, Lord Iorwerth succeeds in freeing theFragment of Seren, and the adventurer is forced to defeat it. After this, the city is fully restored, and the Iorwerth Clan is pardoned by the elves for their actions, who realised they served Lord Iorwerth because they had no choice.[32]Despite this, there is still mistrust for them.[33]Arianwyn, who is ridden by his guilt of betrayal, leaves after helping rebuild Lletya and seeing Prifddinas.[34]

Thanks to the actions of the adventurer, it is decided by the clan elders to open up the city to all races,[35]though it was decided that only a small portion of theGrand Librarywould be opened to them.[36]With other races visiting the city, new additions from far and wide have been added to the Grand Library's bookshelves.[37]
