Isolation of worlds[edit|edit source]

For the most part, events that occur in one world will not affect any otherRuneScapeworld. For example, buying an item in ashopwill only decrease the inventory for the shop in that world. Shop inventory, characterrespawns,item respawns, and resource regeneration (e.g.ores,trees) are all managed individually for each server. Additionally, players (along with chat messages) contained in one world will not be visible to players in another world.

One exception to this rule is the timing of certain events. For example, whentackling organised crime, each world will consistently spawn and despawn the gang meetings at the same times and locations as the other worlds on that server.[clarification needed]

World hopping[edit|edit source]

Because each world has its ownshopinventory, players will often change worlds rapidly to buy from one store many different times. Also, players often switch worlds to find more favourable conditions (e.g. more populated) forminigames,player killing, ortrading. This is known asworld hopping.

Interaction between worlds[edit|edit source]

The only possible ways of interaction betweenRuneScapeworlds isprivate chatusing theFriends Listor throughClan Chat.

Persistence of character state[edit|edit source]

When a user logs off of a world, all settings particular to that character are saved to the player's accountprofilein a global database. Therefore, when logging into a different world, the character'sskills,inventory, etc. will be restored to the same state, regardless of which server the character last logged onto.

Themed servers/worlds[edit|edit source]

In August 2007,Jagexadded a new column to the world select screen highlighting those worlds with associated activities, especially those team-based events likeTrouble Brewing, to make it easier to find people with similar ideas.

In theupdateof July 52018, Jagex removed the themes of several worlds where the theme was unused or no longer necessary. This was only a text change in the world selection screen, with no impact on the actual worlds.

Skill total worlds[edit|edit source]

Skill total worlds are worlds that are locked to accounts that do not meet the requiredTotal levelto enter.Free-to-playskill total worlds calculate total levels fromfree-to-playskillsalone and do not acknowledgemembersskills, meaning players require a cumulative total of 500 or 750 in free-to-play skills (total level of 508 or 758 respectively if all member's skills are 1) to enter those worlds. Members skill total worlds were added August 20, 2015[1]. The free-to-play skill total worlds were added on September 22, 2016 after a suggestion campaign by user Yeet Lmao.[2]

Player killing[edit|edit source]

308 —WildernessPK - Free316 — Wilderness PK - Free365 — High Risk World369 — Wilderness PK - Members392 — PvP World

On these worlds, players may attack each other almost everywhere and are prevented from teleporting for a few seconds after using a special attack in PvP combat on PvP or Bounty Hunter worlds. This is done to prevent players from using their special attack on a player and immediately teleporting away without consequence. Players are also prevented from teleporting while their special attack bar is activated on these worlds.

Normally some PvP worlds are affected by the PvP world rotation, changing when they are available inone weekintervals. This is to reduce the number of worlds to make each more active, while changing locations to provide fairerlagto players across the world.

High-risk worlds[edit|edit source]

High Risk worlds(worlds 365, 474, 533, PvP worlds 548 and 579) are worlds where players will loseallitems on death due to having a special skull status over the head () at all times. The Protect Item prayer does not work on these worlds. Going into these worlds can be arisk, but good way tomake moneyif you have a highCombat levelwith goodarmourandweaponsand are proficient inplayer-versus-playercombat.It is strongly recommended that you only take items that you are willing to lose!Also, note that World 365, 474, and 533 aresafe worlds unless you go into theWildernessas they are notPvPworlds.

Upon killing any opponent, you will always get the items they were wearing and carrying, unless the item is (or was)untradeable, in which case will usually turn into a stack ofgold coinsaccording to its value.

A warning is shown on attempting to login to a high-risk server from the login screen. If using theWorld Switcherinstead, a confirmation will appear. Upon logging into aPvP world, a chat message will appear sayingThis is a PvP World. Players may attack you once you leave this safe area.

Other notable worlds[edit|edit source]

World 302 is the official members server for trading with other players. Along with world 330, it is usually the most populated server in the game during North American daytime and evening hours. Before the removal of theDuel Arena, it was thede factothemed world for the minigame.World 330 is the American server for house parties and player-owned gilded altars. Along with world 302, it is usually the most populated server in the game during North American daytime and evening hours.World 400 is a world inaccessible during normal gameplay, being reserved for special event use by Jagex. Examples includeA Cold One's speedrun ofChambers of Xeric: Challenge Modeas part ofSummer Games Done Quick 2024, various "bot busting" livestreams (whereJagex Moderatorskill accounts confirmed to havemacroedlive, showing the contents of their bank to the stream before permanently banning them), andDeadman: All Stars. It is usually repurposed into aLeaguesworld whenever a League is ongoing.World 420 is a 1500 skill total world noted for itscannabissubculture (due to theserver number).
