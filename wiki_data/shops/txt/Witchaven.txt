Port Khazard

Witchavenis a small village east ofArdougne. A once bustling hive of industry, the village is now a run down ghost town due to the Fishing Platform stealing away local business.[1]It provides access to theFishing Platformand features heavily in theSea SlugandSlug Menacequests. It is also a notablefishing spot.

Travel[edit|edit source]

The nearest teleport isArdougne, to the west. TheLegends' Guildis just to the north, and you can access theFishing Platformby talking toHolgartorJeb, depending on which quests you have completed.

Players with 72 Thieving can also steal from theArdougne Castle chest, triggering "a second magical trap" on the chest and being instantly teleported to theWitchaven Dungeonentrance west of the village. Players with access to fairy rings can use the codeBLRto teleport directly north of the Witchhaven Dungeon (Legends' Guild).

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The village is a reference to the fictitious titular town in the horror novellaThe Shadow over Innsmouth, which was a once-prosperous fishing town that had been abandoned and fallen into disrepair, with the only remaining residents being hybrid human-fish creatures. In comparison, Witchaven was also a once-prosperous fishing town that has since lost business due to the construction of the nearbyFishing Platform, with the remaining residents slowly being taken under the control of thesea slugs.This is further evidenced by the fact that the fishing shop owner of Witchaven is namedEzekial Lovecraft, sharing his surname with the author ofThe Shadow over Innsmouth,H. P. Lovecraft.
