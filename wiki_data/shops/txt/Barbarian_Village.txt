Barbarian Villageis a small village south ofEdgevilleand west ofVarrock. The village contains manyaggressivebarbarians, so low level players are advised to proceed with caution! The entire village is amulticombat area, allowing many players to attack just one barbarian — or many barbarians to attack just one player.

Players can also enter theStronghold of Securitythrough a hole in the centre of the village.

Lore[edit|edit source]

A century ago, the lost art ofRunecraftwas rediscovered, allowing humans to quickly dominate most ofGielinor. The nomadic mountain tribes ofRellekkaembarked on acrusadeto stop the use of Magic and Runecrafting, which they believe belong only to thegods. During this time, the firstWizards' Towerwas burned to the ground (although not by the barbarians), and the magic-usingImcando dwarveswere driven to near-extinction.

As casualties mounted, however, the tribes dwindled and were dispersed, and the Barbarian Village was established in between what is nowVarrockandFaladoras a temporary outpost until the tribes could recover their numbers. Over time, the barbarians gradually settled down, and the village became a more permanent establishment.
