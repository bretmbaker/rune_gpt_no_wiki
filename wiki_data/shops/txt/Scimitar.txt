Scimitar vs. Longsword[edit|edit source]

In short, scimitars have better DPS against most monsters than longswords and are better suited forPvMand trainingmeleestats. Longswords have slightly higher strength bonuses which gives them higher possiblemaximum hits. Overall, it is recommended to get a scimitar over a longsword whenever possible.

The scimitar and longsword are very similar weapons as they are bothslash weaponsand have nearly the sameattack bonusforslash. However, scimitars have anattack speedof 4 while longswords have an attack speed of 5. This lets scimitars attack 1tick(about 0.6 seconds) faster. Longswords have slightly higher strength bonuses than their scimitar counterpart, which gives them an additional +1 to the maximum hit.

Comparing the two weapons, the scimitar will hit 20% faster in exchange for 1 damage to the max hit. This makes them better to use than the longsword in most situations.

It gets more complicated as other factors come into play, such as enemy's defence bonuses, the player'sAttackandStrengthlevels, and the player's attack bonuses from other gear. As a simple example, dragons are relatively weak tostab. Longswords have a much higher attack bonus for stab than scimitar and will do more DPS, assuming the player is using the stab attack style on the scimitar. Scimitars will still do more DPS to dragons than longswords if the slash style is used for the scimitar, even if the longsword is used on stab.
