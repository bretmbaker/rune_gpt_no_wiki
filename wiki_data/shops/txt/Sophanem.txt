Sophanem, theCity of the Dead, is a city located far south in theKharidian Desert, right on the edge of the map, as well as its second largest settlement. In order to gain access to it, players need to progress far enough into theIcthlarin's Little Helperquest. The city is currently being afflicted by several plagues. Sophanem and its inhabitants feature prominently in thedesertquest series. It is connected to the capitalMenaphosvia a large bridge over theRiver Elid.

As its nickname suggests, Sophanem's main business is to take care of the Menaphite deceased, erecting large tombs and pyramids and mainly worshippingIcthlarin, shepherd of the souls of the departed.[1][2]Unfortunately for the Sophanites, these treasure-filled tombs are a magnet for graverobbers such asSimon Templeton. It is the seat of the High Priest of Icthlarin, whose duties include the protection of the great pyramids and ensuring that the souls of the dead are protected from theDevourer, Icthlarin's deranged sister.[3]Catsand their protector, theSphinx, play an important role in this latter task.[4]

As a result of the events of the Icthlarin's Little Helper quest, the city has been stricken by a number of plagues: the people are affected by large, itching spots; a swarm of giantlocustshas eaten the crops; a bunch ofplague frogshave emerged from theRiver Elid; and thelivestockhave become diseased, with the cows producing sour milk. This has greatly affected the economy and caused both Sophanem andMenaphosto be quarantined. The situation improves afterContact!, when Sophanem's market and bank reopen. Withal, Menaphos remains securely locked. The plague is fully cured at the end ofBeneath Cursed Sands, with Menaphos due to reopen soon.

History[edit|edit source]

Virtually nothing is known about Sophanem's past.Osman, spy master ofAl Kharid, refers to the Sophanites as 'old enemies', implying that theAl Kharid - Menaphos Warinvolved Sophanem as well. This would make sense, as Sophanem and Menaphos are intricately connected to one another. At some point, both cities were connected toAli Morrisane'smagic carpetfleet.

In 169 of theFifth Age, the High Priest of Icthlarin,Klenter, passed away and succeeded by a fairly weak-willed man quite unlike the stern, cruel and vindictive Klenter. The Devourer orchestrated a plot to hypnotise a passing adventurer, have them break into theKlenter's Pyramidto steal acanopic jarcontaining Klenter's organs and place hersymbolinside for future access so that she could devour his soul.Icthlarinhimself interfered at the last moment, releasing the adventurer from his sister's hold (with memory loss as a consequence) and raising Klenter's wrathful ghost to protect his soul.

Following this event, Sophanem was beset by plagues, plunging the city into turmoil. Many Sophanites fled to neighbouring Menaphos before the new High Priest and his clergy decided to impose a quarantine upon the city. Menaphos, likewise, was locked down and heavily barricaded. Its chief gatekeeperCoenuswould not allow anyone in or out. The Sophanites began questioning the new High Priest's authority, damaging his self-esteem and exacerbating his panic. The adventurer found themself trapped inside the city with Klenter's canopic jar in their possession, with everyone in the city but theworkers, temporarily relieved of their duties, hostile to them. With the aid of the sphinx, they convinced the High Priest that they had not stolen the jar wittingly, and was instructed to replace the jar in Klenter's tomb whilst gradually regaining their memory.

The jar was returned, but withal the plagues remained. The High Priest, panicking but quickly regaining his calm, suggested that Klenter's soul required a proper burial ceremony for them to abate and started making preparations, whilst the adventurer helped the localembalmerandcarpenterwith their duties. The ritual was performed, but interrupted by the Devourer, who was able to appear thanks to her symbol that had been hidden inside the pyramid. She demanded Klenter's soul, but the adventurer would no longer obey her and the High Priest vowed to stop her at all costs. She possessed another cleric instead and ordered him to kill everyone else, but he was himself defeated by the adventurer thanks to theholy symbol of Icthlarinin his possession.

Not giving up, the Devourer most likely hypnotised yet another passing adventurer to steal another canopic jar whilst the ritual was correctly performed, as a result of which the plagues still remained.[6]This leaves Icthlarin and his clergy locked in a battle over Klenter's soul with the Devourer, which might continue indefinitely.[7]

The exact source of the plagues remains open to debate. Given the timing of their appearance and the High Priest's suggestion that their continued presence is due to his predecessor's not having been properly buried, it seems likely that they were somehow caused by Klenter's soul. This would fit his vengeful personality and explain his ghost's comment to the adventurer about the latter's not being affected by the plague as thanks for returning the canopic jar. The sphinx speculates that the cause of the plagues may have been human, but also divine.[8]Moreover, there is a discussion amongst some of the clergy ofHet, lesser deity of health, as to the cause of the plagues. Some of them think the plagues were sent by Het as a punishment, whilst others disagree and view them as an affront to him.[9]

Although the plagues did not vanish, the spots were realised not to be contagious and the city was reopened. In spite of this development, the Menaphites refused to follow suit. The High Priest led a delegation of townsfolk across the bridge to parlay with Coenus and his guards, but he was repelled and even attacked by the brutal gatekeeper. Unable to inform the Sophanites still trapped in Menaphos that the City of the Dead was safe to return to, the High Priest enlisted the aid of the adventurer once more to find a subterranean passage into Menaphos, suggesting the Sect ofScabarasas a lead. Indeed, the Scabarites had recently broken into the Sophanem bank beneath theTemple of the Lesser Godsfrom below, causing both structures to be wrecked in the ensuing struggle. With the help ofJex, a friendly priest, the adventurer entered the Scabarite tunnels and made it to the end, where they metMaisa, a spy fromAl Kharid, and her deceased colleagueKaleef. The passage to Menaphos itself was not accessible due to a large chasm, however.

Maisa agreed to send word to the Sophanites that they could return if the adventurer would fetch her master,Osman, to help her get out of the quarantined city herself. This was successful, although the Scabarites'giant scarabguardian, already having killed Kaleef, injured Osman before attacking and being slain by the adventurer. Maisa, who had fled out of the cave on the Menaphite side, kept her word and the townspeople returned home. As a result, the High Priest's standing amongst the Sophanites was elevated, and the bustling markets reopened. The economy was boosted further by trading withNardah,PollnivneachandAl Kharid(the latter being part of Osman's plan to use the improved relations with Sophanem as leverage against Menaphos, the old enemy), although the High Priest remarks that he should still like for Menaphos to open up again.
