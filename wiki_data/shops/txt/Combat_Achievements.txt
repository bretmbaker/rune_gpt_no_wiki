Combat Achievements(commonly abbreviated asCA) are a set of combat-based tasks and challengesreleasedon21 July2021. They are intended to test the player's prowess in combat related content, ranging from endurance challenges, killing monsters under a set time limit, and restriction based tasks in which players must kill a monster in a specific manner.

The overview interface for Combat Achievements can be accessed via theCharacter Summarytab.

There are somecombat achievements that can be completed by free-to-play players, although in every tier most tasks are exclusive tomembers.

Tasks which check the player'sboss kill count, as well as time-based tasks forThe Gauntletand Corrupted Gauntlet, are automatically completed if players have the achievements prior to the release of the Combat Achievements system.

Tiers[edit|edit source]

Combat Achievement tasks are split into six categories based on their difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite, Master, and Grandmaster. Each tier contains a number of tasks rewarding points, with the point value per task increasing with each tier.Rewardscan be obtained by achieving specific amounts of points from tasks of any tiers.

Tier | # of tasks | Points per task | Points in tier | Points required for rewards

 | Easy | 38 | 1 | 38 | 38

 | Medium | 55 | 2 | 110 | 148

 | Hard | 82 | 3 | 246 | 394

 | Elite | 155 | 4 | 620 | 1014

 | Master | 158 | 5 | 790 | 1804

 | Grandmaster | 111 | 6 | 666 | 2470

 | Total | 599 |  | 2470 | 

Task types[edit|edit source]

Tasks are sorted into categories based on the requirements. Most tasks within Combat Achievements will rely on the player's ability to complete them alone, though there are tasks which require multiple players to complete, such as tasks for theChambers of Xeric,Theatre of Blood, andThe Nightmare.

Task type | Description

Kill count | Kill a monster a certain number of times.

Mechanical | Defeat a boss in a way that hints at how players are supposed to fight the boss, or tasks the player to kill the boss in a specific, difficult way

Perfection | Complete a task without taking damage or dying.

Restriction | Complete a task under a set of restrictions.

Speed | Kill a boss within a set timeframe.

Stamina | Kill a boss for a certain amount of times without leaving the area.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Players may claim their rewards by speaking toGhommalorLaidee Gnonockby the entrance to theWarriors' Guild. UnlikeAchievement Diaries, players do not need to complete all of the tasks of the previous tier before claiming a reward set for another tier; each reward tier requires having a certain amount of points before players can claim them. This means players can claim a tier's rewards through any combination of tasks, instead of having to complete a lower tier's tasks before being able to claim rewards from a higher tier. The exception to this is the Grandmaster tier reward, which requires completion of all currently available combat tasks.

Should new tasks be released, and the requirement for a previously-met tier increases above a player's point total, rewards for the appropriate tiers are disabled and become unequippable until the new point requirement is met. Higher-tiered versions of Ghommal's hilt can still be activated to teleport, though with the limitations matching the lower tier; for example, Ghommal's hilt 3 can be used to teleport only 5 times per day to the God Wars Dungeon entrance when you have points matching the Medium tier.

Scrapped rewards[edit|edit source]

An off-hand blade was proposed to be added as a reward for completing each tier of the Combat Achievements, which provided increased melee attack bonuses and increased with each tier of tasks completed.

The blade was polled in theCombat Achievementspolland failed to pass, only receiving 64.3% of the supporting votes. The item was later reworked as a teleport item, in the form ofGhommal's hilt. Later, theGrandmasterandMaster hiltswere updated to be able to be combined with theAvernic defender.

In addition, models were made for a slayer helmet design based on theCrystallineandCorrupted Hunllef, though it was never offered as a reward.

Tier | Melee attack bonus | Reclaim cost (coins) | PvP death drop (coins)

 | Easy | +15 | 5,000 | 3,750

 | Medium | +20 | 10,000 | 7,500

 | Hard | +25 | 20,000 | 15,000

 | Elite | +30 | 30,000 | 22,500

 | Master | +35 | 40,000 | 30,000
