Development history[edit|edit source]

During the development of the continent ofZeah, Civitas illa Fortis was supposed to be added to the continent in the third phase of the release, featuring a Colosseum that is a large arena akin toRuneScape's now-removedDuel Arena Tournament.[2]Just the combat ground of the arena is said to be as large as all six sections ofEmir's Arenacombined. Seatings encircle this central area, and the victorious combatants would be rewarded with the entrance fees of the spectators.[3]
