[Shop: Ironmen]

Ironman Modeis an account type, released on13 October2014, that requires the player to be almost entirely self-sufficient. Ironmen are locked out of or restricted in most forms of interactions with other players such astrading, theGrand Exchange,PvP, and almost all other group activities. Attempting to trade with a Ironman will yield the chatbox message "[Player name] is an Ironman. [He/She/They] stands[sic]alone."

Ironman Mode can only be enabled at the end ofTutorial Islandby speaking to theIronman tutorbefore being teleported by theMagic Instructor. There will be an option to convert it to a standard account (or to a regular Ironman in the case of a Hardcore or Ultimate Ironman) at any point after the tutorial by talking to the tutors inLumbridge, but this conversion is permanent, and an account cannot be remade an Ironman. After confirming to toggle Ironman Mode off, there will be a 7-day waiting period before the toggle will take effect, during which time the player may cancel the change if they change their mind or if their account had been hijacked; the change is also cancelled if a Hardcore Ironman dies during the waiting period to become a standard account.

Players may also choose to downgrade an Ironman with a 90-day waiting period by talking to theIronman tutorin Lumbridge. This requires a skill total level of 1,000 to set, and a warning will appear upon login to remind players should they wish to reverse the process.

Hardcore Ironmanwas later released on10 November2016.

Group IronmanandHardcore Group Ironmanwere both released on6 October2021.

Unranked Group Ironmanwas released on26 May2022.

Hardcore[edit|edit source]

Hardcore Ironmanplayers will only haveone life, in addition to the standard restrictions given to all Ironmen. If a Hardcore Ironman dies, they will be converted to astandard Ironman. In addition, their experience and total level on the Hardcore IronmanHiScorestable will be locked, with their nameslashed across like this.

Safe deaths, such as those inminigames, willnotcause the player to become a standard Ironman. The following activities are deemed safe:

Barbarian Assault[h 1]Camelot training room[h 1]Castle WarsChambers of Xeric[h 1]Clan WarsDream WorldduringLunar Diplomacy[h 1]Emir's ArenaFishing Trawler[h 1]The Fremennik Trials- 4th phase of the duel withKoschei the DeathlessInferno[h 1]Last Man StandingMagic Training Arena[h 1]Nightmare Zone[h 1]Pest Control[h 1]Death within aplayer-owned house[h 1]PvM Arena[h 1]Replay ofGloughboss fightSoul WarsTzHaar Fight Cave[h 1]TzHaar Fight PitRandom Event[h 1]Rogues' Den(maze)[h 1]Zulrah- Resurrection reward fromElite Western Provinces Diaryonly

When a Hardcore Ironman dies, the following message appears in their chatbox:You have fallen as a Hardcore Ironman, your Hardcore status has been revoked.[sic]

For Hardcore Group Ironman only,there are no safe PvM deaths.The group has a shared pool ofone life per player; for example, a group of 3 players shares 3 lives between them and will lose Hardcore status after losing the third life. Lives can be lost by any player, and multiple lives can be lost by a single player.

Deaths that would normally be considered "safe" for solo Hardcore Ironmen areNOTsafe for Group Hardcore Ironmen. This means that each death in minigames such asBarbarian Assault,TzHaar Fight Cave, orChambers of Xericwill result in a loss of a life for the group. The only exception to this is theFremennik Trialsfight withKoschei the Deathless(4th phase). Hardcore Group Ironmen should take extra care to use the exit potion when leaving theNightmare Zone, since dying will result in the loss of a life for the group. They should also use extra caution in minigames such asPest Controlas other players can provoke monsters such assplattersand cause them to detonate close to you.

PvP minigames such asLast Man Standing,Clan Wars,Castle Warsand any type of death inSoul Warsare still safe deaths for Hardcore Group Ironmen.

Furthermore, Hardcore Group Ironmen are unable to challengeNexwith members outside of their group, regardless of Group Prestige.

Ultimate[edit|edit source]

Ultimate Ironmenhave a number of extra restrictions in addition to those of an Ironman, all centred around the inability to store items in abank:

They are still able to unnote items at banks.Cannot createitem setsusing theGrand Exchange.Cannot receive resources fromManaging Miscellaniaor dailybuckets of sandfromBert.Cannot send items withCoal Trucks, theDwarven BoatmanorDaeyalt essenceto the bank.Cannot send theirServantto the bank or theSawmill.Cannot store anything in theseed vault.Cannot store duplicate items in the POH Costume Room, or withdraw items before first depositing the entire set an item belongs to.Cannot utilise thelooting bag's mechanics on aPvP worldoutside of the Wilderness.

Inside instances and theGod Wars Dungeonitems will still be put outside, with supplies dropped on the floor. Item retrieval services work as normal, with the exception of at Zulrah.Items dropped on death will remain where they are for an hour after death until despawning. This timer pauses when logged out.Ultimate Ironmen may always retrieve items for free fromZul-Gwenwynig, and do not have an interface to reclaim their items from. Instead being given directly into the inventory when reclaimed.Untradeable items are always dropped on death, if killed in the Wilderness most items are converted into coins and dropped for the player who killed the Ultimate Ironman.

Group[edit|edit source]

Ironmen and bonds[edit|edit source]

Ironmen can getbondsas gifts from other players or through the official Old School website. They can also turn untradeable bonds into tradeable bonds, and can give bonds to other players by using the item on them. Ironmen are able to buy bonds from the Grand Exchange, which disallows them from buying or selling any other item via a unique interface.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Prior to the introduction of Ironman Mode, players who played withouttradingany other players, with the exception ofShield of ArravandHeroes' Quest, were called purists or self-sufficient accounts, or were said to be playing a "DIY" (Do It Yourself) style.Players in Ironman mode can only obtain the armour appropriate to their chosen Ironman selection; for instance, Hardcore Ironmen can only obtain the Hardcore Ironman armour. Similarly, players who downgrade their account from one type of Ironman to another will have their armour replaced with the corresponding type, and players who have their Ironman status removed will simply lose the armour altogether.
