Getting back to Lumbridge can be done using the above options, as well as several others:

TheLumbridge Home Teleportspell does not have aMagiclevel requirement, nor does it require runes, but it has a 30 minute cooldown after being used.TheLumbridge Teleportspell requires level 31 Magic and uses 3air runes, 1earth rune, and 1law rune.Memberswho lack the Magic requirement can use theteleport tabletform instead.Note:This is the only way for free-to-play players to easily return to Lumbridge besides the home teleport spell.If not on thestandard spellbook, using a more accessible teleport to a nearby area and running back to Lumbridge can be done as well (eg. using anamulet of gloryto teleport toAl KharidorDraynor Village, flying to Al Kharid using agnome glider, usingfairy ringDISto teleport to theWizards' Tower, etc.)Dying is a valid method of getting back to Lumbridge if the player has their respawn point set there, but should only be done if they have banked any items they are not willing to lose or are willing to payDeathto remotely reclaim their items from theirgravestone. Thering of returningandRespawn Teleportspell on theArceuus spellbookboth work in a similar manner.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The name 'Lumbridge' is based on the real life city ofCambridge, England, where the Gower brothers grew up and whereJagexhas its headquarters. The cities' name schemes are similar: Lumbridge is built over the river Lum while Cambridge is built over the river Cam.Upon players completing the questGarden of Tranquillity, the statue ofKing Roaldoutside of the Lumbridge castle courtyard becomes an empty plinth and the statue itself is moved to the garden east of the Varrock palace.The fourthgod lettercontains a response bySaradominwriting about the early days ofRuneScape. He says Lumbridge used to host traditional Sunday afternoon craft fairs that were 'a bit of a let down' as a result of there being noCraftingskill at the time.[1]According to another god letter, Lumbridge has a football team called theLumbridge Eagles.
