TheRuins of Camdozaalis a ruined underground city which was once the home of theImcando dwarvesafter the fall ofImcandoria. It is located beneathIce Mountain, accessed through the entrance on the western side of the mountain after completion of thequestBelow Ice Mountain. The ruins are home to theSacred Forge, which runs on a material calledbarronite, and powers the entire city.[1]

History[edit|edit source]

Prior to theImcando dwarves' founding of Camdozaal, the city was once theZarosianfortress ofLassar.[2]Having lost their great city ofImcandoriain the far north,[3]the Imcando dwarves were promised a new home bySaradomin,[4]who would have his forces lay siege to Lassar and grant the Imcando dwarves a new settlement in the ruins of the fortress.

Led byYonrith Lovakengj,[5]the Saradominist forces marched upon Lassar and destroyed it in one of many attacks on theZarosian Empirethat began after theBetrayal of Zaros. Once the Zarosian forces have been driven out, the Imcando dwarves set to build their new city, naming it Camdozaal. The city would become the prosperous home of the Imcando until the earlyFifth Age, when a faction ofFremennikssought to destroy any users of magic in theRunecrafting Crusades.

With their inclusion of magic in dwarven smithing techniques,[6]as well as experimentation withgolems[7]left over from the Zarosian era,[8]the Fremennik turned their weapons toward Camdozaal. The Imcando dwarves, believing their weapons to be strong enough to repel the invasion, were ultimately wiped out.[9]

Today, Camdozaal is a shadow of its former self, andRamarnois the only remaining inhabitant of the city,[10]until the rediscovery of the ruins during the events ofBelow Ice Mountain. Though largely forgotten, there remain traces of Lassar in various areas of the ruins.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

'Zaal' is the Dutch word for 'hall' or 'large room'.If thering of visibilityandghostspeak amuletare worn, several ghosts can be found wandering the ruins, although they do not appear as NPCs on the minimap: one in the chaos golem room, one in the hallway north of the bank chest and another in the mining area.One of the ghosts in the mining area talks aboutYonrith Lovakengj, alluding to a link between the ruins and Kourend'sLovakengj House. This connection is elaborated upon during the questDesert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire.In aPostbag from the Hedge, a letter was addressed to the bottomless pit.Postie Petetranscribed its whispers as 'Here... In the inky depths... We languish in sorrow... Come... Come... Join our choir of shadow... Come...'[11]
