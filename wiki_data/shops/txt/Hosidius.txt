Hosidiusis one of the five cities in the Kingdom ofGreat Kourend. Led byLord Kandur Hosidiusof the Hosidius House, their main export focus is onFarming/agriculture andCooking, and are the primary supplier of food to the citizens of the Kingdom as well as the soldiers of theShayzien Army. Most people in Hosidius worshipSaradomin, though a few also worshipZamorak, although as with other human settlements, they are looked down upon.

Because of the high demand of food in Great Kourend, Hosidius requires a large amount of land to grow their crops in, and thus possesses the most land out of the five cities - this is because a famine struck the kingdom sometime during 5th BA to 1st BA (1,460 years ago). Five years after the famine began,Lord Ethrain Hosidius Imet with the Lords of the other four Houses, coming to an agreement that half of each of the city's lands be granted to Hosidius in order to grow more crops to stop the famine, which was then approved by the ruling Council of Elders.

LikeShayzien, Hosidius is one of the more recent cities founded in the history of Great Kourend - the founder is unknown, but it was created by refugees escaping theDragonkin Conflicts.

Favour (historical)[edit|edit source]

Prior toan updateon10 January2024,favourwas a core mechanic of each city onKourend. Historical information about gaining favour and its benefits are documented below.

Gaining favour[edit|edit source]

Earning Hosidius favour can be done by helping with the production of farmed foods and preparing food for soldiers. Once you have earned Hosidius favour, you will gain access to both the city kitchens, which reduces the chance of burning food when cooking using their ranges by 5%, access to a newSpirit tree patch, access to theWoodcutting GuildandFarming Guild, and the ability to play theTithe Farmminigame, which focuses on gainingFarmingexperience.

To progress in theArchitectural Allianceminiquest, players must gain 100% Hosidius favour and speak toHosaby the statue in theKourend Castlecourtyard.

The amount of earned favour can be checked under the quest tab, then select the purple icon within this quest tab.

At 0% favour, players can only plough the fields found south of the town square. Players will need to push theploughback and forth to till the soil. Favour is granted randomly while performing this activity.

Players will automatically keep pushing the plough until they reach the edge of the field (pushing the plow from the other side will change its direction), or until the plough breaks, in which case they will need to use ahammerto repair it (there is one on the ground just south of the field), granting 10Craftingexperience. Ploughing fields will also randomly grant 10 Farming experience every so often.

It is not necessary to switch fields or move the plough beyond pushing it back and forth; the same amount of favour will be given regardless of location.

Ploughs are found in the south-east ofHosidius, north-west of the Tithe farm, south-west of the Vinery. A quick way to reach them is to use theSkills necklaceteleport to theWoodcutting Guild, and walk east, across the saltpetre area, and walk South-east when reaching the Altar.

With the removal ofKourend Favour, the plough fields were removed and replaced with fields ofwheatandpotatoes.

At 5% favour, players can makesulphurous fertiliser. Each bucket made grants 2Farmingexperience to the player.

The fertilizer is made fromsaltpetreand regularcompost. Manually combining them is faster than the AFK method.Saltpetre can be traded with other players, or can be found in the area east of theWoodcutting Guild, and will spawn in one of five possible locations within the area, and moves once the deposit is depleted. A helpful tip is thatKonoo, a saltpetre digger, will be located wherever the latest saltpetre deposit is located. Aspadeis required to gather saltpetre. If players do not have one, Konoo can also provide a spare spade. For faster collecting, use the bank deposit box in the centre of the area.

Saltpetre can also be collected by subduingWintertodt. This approach may take a lot longer, but if players plan to do Wintertodt anyway, they might consider collecting saltpetre in this way.

After combining the saltpetre with compost, players are to give the fertiliser to theClerk, located at a building in the middle of the Saltpetre area. In return, players will receive 0.1% favour for every bucket of sulphurous fertiliser given to the Clerk. The Clerk will take all sulphurous fertilisers in the player's possession, including the bank, which means players do not need to make multiple trips to donate, and can gain massive amounts of favour in one go. From 5% favour, it takes 150 buckets of sulphurous fertilisers to reach 20%, 400 to reach 45%, 700 to reach 75%, 850 to reach 90% (Allowing for completion ofThe Depths of Despairto reach 100% favour), or 950 to reach 100%. At current prices, 950 of each costs approximately24,700 coins. Note that the buy limit for compost is 2000 - players may wish to buycompost packsat a lower rate of 2,000gp from anyfarming shop. Should a player opt to buy all 950 of the compost needed from a farming shop and buy saltpetre from theGrand Exchange, 100% favour would cost approximately27,600 coins.

As mentioned above, at 5% favour it is advisable to make sulphurous fertilizer. One of the easiest methods is by visitingVannah's Farming Stalllocated in Hosidius. Players may buycompost packsand store them using the Exchange feature withTool Leprechaunslocated around Gielinor. From 5% favour you'll need 950 compost for 100% favour. After they're stored, dig saltpetre and use the saltpetre on the compost, which you can pick up from the Tool Leprechaun at the nearby spirit tree patch (for added efficiency hop worlds to find a saltpetre spawn close to the Leprechaun). You may turn in sulphurous fertilizer to the Clerk located near the bank deposit box next to the saltpetre.

Once players reach 20% favour, they can start theDepths of Despairquest. This quest requires completion ofClient of Kourend,X Marks the Spot, and level 18 Agility. Completion of the quest will grant aHosidius favour certificateworth 10% favour.

Once players have 45% favour, they are able to cook in theMess, where they must cook meals for theShayziensoldiers according to their demands as shown on the screen, using provided ingredients. The soldiers wantstew,meat pie, orpineapple pizza. In order to participate in this activity, players must have the appropriateCookinglevel to cook the meals: 20 for meat pie, 25 for stew, and 65 for pineapple pizza. Players will gain moderate amounts of Cookingexperienceand favour once they serve the food on the buffet, based on the demand for the meals the player serves.

At 65%favour, players will have access to theVinery, where they can farmgrapesafter usingsaltpetreandgrape seedson a vine patch (requires 36Farming, can beboosted). Players are granted 0.8% favour for eachgrape seedplanted.

Favour benefits[edit|edit source]

At 15% favour, players can steal fruit from thefruit stallin front ofLogava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies.At 35% favour, players can plant aspirit saplingin thespirit tree patchlocated south-east of the Forthos Ruin. (83Farming)At 50% favour, the allotment, flower, and herb patches just south of the Hosidius township, are permanently protected fromdisease.At 60% favour, players with at least 45Farmingcan enter theFarming Guild.At 65% favour, players can plantgrape seedsin theVinery.At 75% favour, players with at least 60Woodcuttingcan enter theWoodcutting Guild.At 100% favour, players with at least 34Farmingcan participate in theTithe Farmminigame, which can be found in the mid-eastern part of Hosidius.At 100% favour, players can use the city kitchens directly south-east of theMess. Abank chestcan be found in the small building, along with a range that provides a 5% increase to the chance of successfully cooking food over a standard range, thus making this one of the best spots to cook.If a player is cooking food that they already have the level to not burn, then this method gives slightly less experience per hour than theRogues' Denfire due to the time spent running to and from the bank chest.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Hosidius may derive fromHortusmeaning 'garden' in Latin, also alluding to the word 'horticulture', being the cultivation of plants in gardens and greenhouses, which is how many plants are grown in theFarming-oriented Hosidius.
