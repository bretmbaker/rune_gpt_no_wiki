Type | Melee



Asquare shieldorsq shieldis a type of metalshieldwith a rectangular shape.

Compared to thekiteshield, both have very strongSlashdefence. However square shields are strong againstStabattacks and weak toCrushattacks while kiteshields are vice versa. This is similar to the relation betweenplatebodiesandchainbodies; however, kiteshields will have the same or superior Stab defence to their square counterparts. While they provide less overall defence than a kiteshield, they weigh slightly less, take fewer bars to make, do not provide negative Magic defence, and have no negative Ranged attack bonus.
