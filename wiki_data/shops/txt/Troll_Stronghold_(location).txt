TheTroll Strongholdis a stronghold inhabited bymountain trollsin theTroll Country. Notable trolls found inside includeBurntmeat,My Arm,UgandKobfrom variousquestsinvolving trolls.

The stronghold itself is carved into the side of the mountain that theMountain Campis situated on top of.

The Stronghold has three levels, with the top level having some small windows carved out into the rock that overlook the aforementioned camp. The Troll Stronghold Storeroom, which contains the trolls' hoard of the rare herb,Goutweed, can also be found within the stronghold. The storeroom revolves around an activity in which players can steal Goutweed.

Many of the trolls in the stronghold areaggressive. Quest-related trolls as well as troll cooks are not aggressive. The troll guards in the storeroom will not fight players but will hit (once) and expel any they catch in the storeroom.

On the roof of the stronghold, there is aherb farming patch, which cannot become diseased, accessible to players who have completed the questMy Arm's Big Adventure.

Location and entrances[edit|edit source]

The main entrance to the stronghold is situated west ofTrollheim, found atop a small slope found east of the small camp of trolls. This entrance takes you directly to the top floor of the stronghold. Players can get to Trollheim by using thestandard spellbookspellTrollheim Teleportif they have completed theEadgar's Rusequest or by walking there fromBurthorpe(Climbing bootsare required).

There is also a southern entrance unlocked during theTroll Strongholdquest, found situated in a mountain passage between Burthorpe and theFremennik Province(climbing boots are also required). This entrance grants access to the strongholds lowest level, where the trolls keep their prisoners. Players very commonly use thefairy ringsystem to get nearby - using the combinationAJR(Kandarin), which takes them just south-west of this entrance.You must remember climbing boots to scale the rocks to get to this entrance.
