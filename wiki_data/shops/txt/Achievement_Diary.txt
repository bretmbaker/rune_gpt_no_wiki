TheAchievement Diary(also known asDiaries) is a one-off set of tasks and challenges exclusive tomembersthat can be completed to obtain rewards and various benefits. Each Achievement Diary consists of tasks that are usually tied to a specific area, and are intended to test the player's skills and knowledge about the said area. There are currently twelve areas that have an Achievement Diary, and a total of 492 tasks.

The tasks of each area are split into four categories based on their difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard and Elite. The easiest tasks usually do not require any significant skill levels to complete, but most higher-level tasks require the player to have high skill levels and difficult quests completed, as well as in-depth knowledge of a particular area withinGielinor, such as theTzHaar Fight Cave.

Easy requires skills up to level 40 (50 for ironmen), Medium up to level 65, Hard up to level 75, and Elite requires skills in the 90s. For this reason, if you are pursuing the completion of all the diaries of a specific difficulty, it is recommended that you have all your skills at the diary difficulty level.

Diary tasks can be checked off from any tier regardless of overall diary completion, however you will be unable to claim your reward from a tier unless you have finished all of the preceding tiers. Rewards may be claimed at the diary's corresponding task master (see table below). Note that there are no requirements to begin completing tasks and you are only required to speak to a task master in order to claim your rewards.

Players who have completed all the achievement diaries can purchase anAchievement diary capefromTwiggy O'KorninDraynor Villagefor 99,000coins. Completing all the achievement diaries will also add an optional cyan trim to theQuest point cape.  Completing all the achievement diaries is a requirement for the black trim to theMusic cape(with the additional requirements of all quests completed and all holiday music tracks unlocked).
