Rangedis one of the threecombat classesinOld School RuneScape. It involves usingbows,crossbows, and thrownweaponsto damage opponents from a distance, andRanged armourcan mostly be made from animal hides. Players who specialise in thisskillare known as rangers or archers.

Thecombat triangledictates that rangers are strong against mages but weak against melee fighters.

The ability to attack from a distance means that a player cansafespota meleemonsterwhile fighting from safety. Keep in mind that some melee monsters have high Ranged Defence, so a high Ranged level may be needed.Crossbowsare useful against monsters with high Defence, as they are very accurate.

Players can toggle whether they want ammunition on the ground to automatically be equipped or remain in the inventory when picked up by talking to theRanged combat tutor.

Equipment[edit|edit source]

Stats[edit|edit source]

There are three ranged equipment stats, two for attack (Ranged Attack andRanged Strength) and one for defence (Ranged Defence).

Ranged weapons(and frequentlyRanged armour) provide + Ranged Attack for accuracy, + Ranged Strength for max hit, and armour provides + Ranged Defence.

Note: In the case of crossbows and bows, the bows provide the Ranged Attack and the ammo provides Ranged Strength, while withdarts,knivesandthrowing axes(where the ammo is the weapon) both stats are provided by the weapon. In this case, ammo serves no purpose (thoughblessingsstill give aprayer bonushowever).

Weapons[edit|edit source]

Ranged weapons have threecombat styles: accurate, rapid, and longrange. The accurate style provides an invisible +3 bonus to the player's Ranged level, increasing their accuracy and possibly increasing their max hit. The rapid style increases the player'sattack speedby 1, resulting in the highest damage per second of all the styles in almost all situations. The longrange style increasesattack rangeby 2, provides an invisible +3 bonus to the player'sDefencelevel, and splits earned exp between Ranged and Defence.

Furthermore, ammunitions have specific damage types similar to the melee's styles of Stab, Slash, and Crush, though it only applies to monsters. For example, some monsters have less defence against heavy ammunition than light and standard ones, and would be preferred in such encounters. A list of some monsters with weakened defence against a particular ammunition type can be found on thisnews post.

Light:  Thrown weapons such asdarts,knives,thrownaxes,Toktz-xil-ul, theToxic blowpipe, and theTonalztics of ralosStandard:Arrows,Atlatl darts,Salamanders, and magical arrows from theCrystal bowandBow of FaerdhinenHeavy:Bolts,javelins, andchinchompas

Weapon | Information

 | ShortbowsLongbows | Thesebowsboth fire the samearrows, differing in speed and range, but not in damage or accuracy. Longbows could be used for additional range, but are slower than shortbows on rapid. Themagic shortbowhas aspecial attackwhich hits twice, and themagic longbowhas a special attack which boosts accuracy.

 | DartsThrowing knivesThrowing axes | Darts and throwing knives have the highestattack speedin the game, but low Ranged attack, Ranged strength and attack range stats. Throwing axes have superior damage and accuracy, but a slower attack speed.

 | Toktz-xil-ul | Toktz-xil-ul, also known as throwing rings, are as powerful as amagic shortbowwithrune arrows.

 | Chinchompas | Chinchompasdeal very little damage, but they hit multiple targets, making them excellent for training. Because of this, they are extremely expensive.

 | Composite bows | These bows are similar to longbows, but have a faster attack speed and slightly higher accuracy. These bows can only be obtained from completingTreasure Trailsor by trading with another player. Themagic comp bowhas the samespecial attackas themagic longbow.

 | Crossbows | Crossbowsare very accurate, andcrossbow boltsdeal significantly more damage thanarrows, making crossbows effective for training Ranged. Crossbows are slower than standard bows, but are also one-handed, so ashieldorgod bookcan be used for protection.

 | Dorgeshuun crossbow | This is the only crossbow which can fire the cheapbone bolts. It is also faster than normal crossbows, and has aspecial attackwhich lowers the target'sDefencelevel.

 | Karil's crossbow | Despite being a crossbow, it is more like a shortbow, requiring two hands and having a fastattack speed, along with longer range.Karil's crossbowwill only work withbolt racks, which break when fired, making it expensive to use. This weapon should only be used against theTzTok-Jadand players, as everything else can be done more cheaply.

 | Ogre bowComp ogre bow | The ogre bow uses ogre arrows. It is extremely slow; its only real use is for huntingchompy birds. The composite ogre bow has the same speed as a crossbow, and can usebrutal arrowsas well as ogre arrows.Rune brutalshave the same Ranged Strength bonus asdragon arrows.

 | Dark bow | Thedark bowis the slowestweaponin the game, but it fires twoarrowsat once. It can firedragon arrows, and it has a devastatingspecial attackwhich boosts damage by 30% if using arrows that are not dragon, or by 50% if using dragon arrows, with a minimum damage of 5 per non-dragon arrow and 8 per dragon arrow.

 | Toxic blowpipe | Thetoxic blowpipeis a powerful rangedweaponthat usesdartsandZulrah's scalesforammunition. Againstmonsters, it has the same speed as darts/knives, but against players, it has the sameattack speedas shortbows. Additionally, the toxic blowpipe can inflict targets withvenom, which deals increasing damage over time.

 | Dwarf multicannon | Thedwarf multicannonis a supplementary weapon that is set up by the player and attacks enemies on its own. There is no Ranged level requirement to use it. It is fast and powerful (with a max hit of 30), yet expensive to use, and there are a limited number of areas where it can be set up for usage. For example, it cannot be used against bosses except theCorporeal Beast. Nonetheless, it's useful and great to have on board, especially on certainSlayer tasks(e.g.dagannoths).

 | Twisted bow | Thetwisted bowis one of the most powerful ranged weapons in the game, being able to hit extremely high on certain monsters. It has a passive ability that increases its accuracy and damage based on the target'sMagiclevel.

 | Crystal bow | A relatively strong composite bow. Its damage and accuracy can be increased by wearing pieces of theCrystal armour. Generates its ownammo, but degrades.

 | Craw's bow | This powerful shortbow has 50% increased damage against monsters in theWilderness. Generates its ownammo, but needs to be charged withRevenant ether.

 | Ballista | Thelight ballistaandheavy ballistaare two-handed ranged weapons which usejavelinsas ammunition. They are slow, but capable of dealing high hits.

 | Bow of faerdhinen | A very powerful composite bow. Its damage and accuracy can be increased by wearing pieces of theCrystal armour. Generates its ownammo. When corrupted, it does not degrade.
