The guildmaster,Gadrin, also sells theMining capeto those who have achieved level 99 Mining.

While inside this area of the guild, players will receive an invisible +7 level boost to their Mining. This boost will stack with any existing boosts the player already has, such as the visible +3 boost from using thedragon pickaxe'sspecial attackas well as the invisible +4 boost from theCelestial ring/Celestial signet, though visible boosts are capped to level 99.[1]However, the invisible boostwill notallow a player to perform actions above their base level.
