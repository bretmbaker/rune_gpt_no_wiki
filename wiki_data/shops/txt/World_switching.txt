[Shop: World_switching]

World switching, also known asworld hopping, is the act of switching to a differentserver. The most common reason for doing so is to find a server where there are currently no other players in a given area, allowing the world hopper to freely harvest the resources there without competition.

World switching can be very important inmerchantingas prices often vary between worlds. This is noticeable in theFishingshop inPort Sarim, particularly with the prices oflobsterandswordfish. Another type of merchanting is calledvial hopping. It consists of buying out the stock ofHerblorepotionvialsin a particular shop then switching worlds and repeating the process.

World switching is also used to effectively minerunite ore, which, given the small number of rocks per world and a long respawn time, is very difficult to obtain at a decent rate without world switching.

Overview[edit|edit source]

EachOld School RuneScapeworld is hosted on its own computer, known as aserver. Servers are continuously connected to the internet, and receive tie-ins from connections of players all over the world. The servers host these players (up to 2000 on a single server) while they playOld School RuneScape. To ease strain on the servers runningOld School RuneScape,Jagexcreated many different servers as to not overload a single server with too many players. Unlike many other MMORPGs, a single character can visit any of the worlds.

Players log into that server and are able to interact with all of the elements —monsters,buildings,items, etc. — found on that world. These worlds, each located on its own server, are identical in form and yet independent of each other. Actions taken on World 1 will not affect the building, monsters, or items on World 2. For example, buying all of thechiselsin theLumbridge General Storeon World 1 will not reduce the number of chisels in Lumbridge General Store on any other world. The side effect of these semi-duplicate worlds is if a store is overstocked or out of stock, or amineis too busy or mined out for now, players can return to the world select screen and try a different world.

When a player stays in a particular location — such as a shop ororespawn — while changing worlds, this is calledworld hopping.

World Switcher[edit|edit source]

Players who have not been attacked incombatfor 10 seconds can freely hop between worlds by clicking on the logout button () and selecting "World Switcher". Here, players can easily switch between worlds aroundOld School RuneScape, and sort the list of worlds by mode, number, server location, amount of players, and designated activity.

The cog icon on the top left is the "Configure" option, which allows further customisation of the list of worlds displayed by giving players the option of filtering out the aforementioned factors; for example, within the Configuration interface, players disinterested inplayer killingcan hide PvP, Deadman, and High Risk Worlds if they so choose.

Lastly, players can also favourite up to two worlds at a time by right-clicking a world, which are then always shown on the very bottom of the tab.

Thenon-player characternamedHopleezpokes fun at world hopping as a whole (due to him being a parody of other players telling each other to hop worlds so that multiple players aren't fighting for the same resources).
