While inside the guild, players will receive an invisible +7 level boost to their Woodcutting.

Ent dungeon[edit|edit source]

The Woodcutting Guild dungeon, accessible through thecave entrancenear the sawmill, contains 22Ents(combat level 86) and abank chest. It is the only place outside theWildernesswhere players can kill and woodcut ent remains. Unlike the wilderness ents, the ents in the dungeon will only reward one noted log instead of two for every successful chop. If the player is using a boost to enter the guild, level 60 Woodcutting (not boostable) is also required to enter the dungeon.

Another bank chest can be found in the back of the ent dungeon. The chest is one of the most-unused banks in the game, making it a potential location for players looking to train bankable skills quietly.
