Comparison[edit|edit source]

The dragon scimitar is one of the most easily attainable one-handed training weapons in the game. Its power is surpassed by weapons like theabyssal whipand theGhrazi rapier. Due towhipsandhastaebeing unable to solely train Strength, the dragon scimitar is often used to do so, and is therefore one of the most commonly used weapons in the game to train Strength.

It shares similar bonuses withViggora's chainmace, with the chainmace being acrush weaponrather than aslash weapon.

Ornament kit[edit|edit source]

Players can attach adragon scimitar ornament kitor aBounty Hunter ornament kitto cosmetically enhance the scimitar, creating adragon scimitar (or)ordragon scimitar (cr)respectively. This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It can be dismantled, returning the scimitar and ornament kit.

Changes[edit|edit source]

Date | Changes

4 April2005(update) | The Dragon scimitar special attack was changed to use 55% special attack energy and now prevents your opponent from using protection prayers for 5 seconds.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The dragon scimitar was not actually released until almost four months after the release of theMonkey Madness Iquest on29 March2005.If the player askedZeketo sell them a dragon scimitar, he would say, "Seriously, you'll be a monkey's uncle before you'll ever hold a dragon scimitar." The joke is that in Monkey Madness I, the player plays the role of a monkey's uncle to complete a certain part of the quest, and completing the quest is required to wield the dragon scimitar.The Dragon scimitar originally had aspecial attackthat stopped your opponent from moving for a short period of time but Jagex later changed it inan updateto stop protection prayers instead.
