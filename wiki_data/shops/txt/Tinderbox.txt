Thetinderboxis used primarily forlighting firesby clicking 'use' on the tinderbox, then clicking a log. A tinderbox can be bought in most general stores. It is also used to light and relightcandlesandlanterns, so any player venturing into a dark area such as theLumbridge Cavesshould bring one in case theirlight sourcegoes out.

When used on logs that the player has theFiremakinglevel to light, the messagesYou attempt to light the logs.andThe fire catches and the logs begin to burn.are displayed. If the player is standing on a tile where they are unable to light logs, the messageYou can't light a fire here.is displayed instead.

When used on logs that the player does not have the Firemaking level to light, a variation of the messageYou need a Firemaking level of X to burn X logs.is displayed.

The tinderbox is also used regularly in manyquests.

The following places spawn tinderboxes:

Top floor ofDraynor ManornearProfessor Oddenstein's machineIn the small shed immediately south of theFarming GuildOn the wrecked ship on the north ofHarmony IslandSearching certain shelves of theWise Old Man's home gives a tinderbox, possibly book(s) and a message questioning why he keeps so many tinderboxes. This is likely due to Dionysus's eventual assault upon theWizards' Tower. Though it is possible to quickly obtain multiple tinderboxes from it, your character will only take one at a time, and only if your inventory has none; this can be easily bypassed through thedrop trick.From the axecrateat the Wintertodt. The same drop trick described above can be used here.Upstairs ofGnocci the Cook's house inCorsair Covehas an infinite spawn of tinderboxes. You can only have 5 tinderboxes in your inventory before being told you already have plenty, although drop tricking bypasses this.
