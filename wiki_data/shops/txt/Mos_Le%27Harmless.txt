Trivia[edit|edit source]

Despite the name sounding like "mostly harmless" the island is in fact very dangerous due to the large quantities of jungle horrors and the dark cave with deadly monsters lurking within.The name "Mos Le'Harmless" alludes to theHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxyseries by Douglas Adams, in which the guide's entry on planet Earth is simply "Mostly Harmless".[1]
