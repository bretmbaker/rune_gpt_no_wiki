Piscatoris Hunter area

ThePiscatoris Fishing Colonyis a settlement located north of the hunter area north of theEagles' Peak.Swan Songmust be partially completed in order to enter the colony, though the area will be instanced until the quest is completed. NOTE: Swan Song does not need to be started or completed to use thePiscatoris teleportscroll.

The colony once thrived on themonkfishindustry but has recently come under attack fromsea trolls. Players get a chance to help the town duringSwan Song. After completing thequest, players may fish for monkfish from any of thefishing spotsalong the colony's northern coast. Players are also able to fish for tuna and swordfish at these same fishing spots using aharpoon, though this is rarely done as better spots with fewer quest requirements exist for fishing of this type.

The colony has long been a popular spot to trainFishingfor higher-level players capable of completing the quest due to the experience rates of fishing for monkfish and the fishing spots' proximity to the colonybank. In addition, one of the hunting zones ofRuneScapeis located south of Piscatoris, sharing its name. Players who have completedSwan Songmay find the bank here useful when trainingHunterin thePiscatoris Hunter area.

Players may also find twonetsin the north east corner of the colony whereseaweedcan be collected every 3 seconds. This can be a useful method of obtaining seaweed given the very close bank.
