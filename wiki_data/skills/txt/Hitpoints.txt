Types of damage[edit|edit source]

Players can experience damage to their hitpoints through:

CombatSelf-inflicted (see below)DiseaseEnvironment (see below)PoisonVenom

Fighting[edit|edit source]

While fighting, both the player and their opponent have a bar over them. This bar represents their Hitpoints.

There are two colours on the bar; green and red. The green part of the bar represents how many Hitpoints a character has left and the red part represents how many Hitpoints they are missing, i.e. the net damage they have suffered. So if a player is low on Hitpoints, then the bar over them would be mostly red, meaning they are near death. Players often refer to "being redbarred" when barely surviving or only just getting a kill for this reason.

When a player's Hitpoints reach zero, theydie. Managing hitpoints to avoid this outcome is a crucial skill inOld School RuneScape.

The penalties and losses from dying depend on where the player was located and what kind of combat they were engaged in. Players should familiarize themselves with theDeathpage if they wish to learn more about what happensafterhitpoints are depleted.

A player can heal to restore their Hitpoints up to, or occasionally above, their maximum in several ways.

Regeneration[edit|edit source]

Players regenerate1 Hitpoint per minute. This can be boosted with the following effects:

TheRapid HealPrayeror theHitpoints capedouble the regeneration rate, healing an additional 1 Hitpoint per minute.These effects do not stack with each other.TheRegen braceletalso doubles the regeneration rate. This can stack with either of the above effects, resulting in a regeneration rate of 4 Hitpoints per minute.The Lunar spellDreamincapacitates the player, ending only once the caster reaches full health, but increases the regeneration rate to 3 Hitpoints per minute.

Restoration[edit|edit source]

Foodis the most common and reliable method of restoring Hitpoints. Food can restore large amounts of Hitpoints quickly and cheaply.Because of how important food is, unlocking access to stronger tiers of food is often considered a significant milestone.

Saradomin brewscan restore more Hitpoints per inventory slot than food, but have unique drawbacks to be considered. They are often used when inventory space or sustainability is a concern.

The monks at theEdgeville Monasterywill heal players when asked. They heal 2 + 20% of the player's current Hitpoints, exceptAbbot Langleywhich heals 4 + 12% of the player's current Hitpoints.The nurses at theEmir's Arenahospital will heal players when asked. They heal 2 + 20% of the player's current Hitpoints.TheElidinis StatuetteinNardahfully restores a player's Prayer points, completely heals them, restores their run energy and special attack energy, cures poison, and gives a temporary Hitpoints boost depending on the player's Hitpoints level. Players who have completed theElite Desert Diarycan take advantage of thedesert amulet 4, which provides unlimitedNardahteleports and teleports the player close to the statue. It is also directly south of aFairy ring(DLQ). This statue can only be used afterSpirits of the Elidis complete.Drinking from anornate rejuvenation poolin a player-owned house or apool of refreshmentat theFerox Enclaverestores all of a player's Hitpoints.Entering theFree-for-all portalin theFerox Enclaveand then exiting will restore all of the player's Hitpoints and drained stats.Entering theGauntletorCorrupted GauntletinPriffdinasand then exiting will restore all of the player's Hitpoints and drained stats.

Phoenix necklacesautomatically restore the wearer's Hitpoints by 30% of their maximum if their Hitpoints drop below 20% of their maximum.Ring of lifewhile not strictly a recovery, can prevent accidental deaths by automaticallyteleportingthe player safely back to their respawn point if they take a hit which causes them to fall to or below 10% of their maximum Hitpoints; as long as that hit does not kill them outright.

Healing from others[edit|edit source]

Heal Otheris aLunar spellwhich transfers up to 75% of the caster's current Hitpoints to the targeted player.Heal Groupis aLunar spellwhich reduces the caster's current Hitpoints by 75% and heals up to five injured players.TheSnowy knightbutterflyrestores another player's Hitpoints by 15.

Life Leech[edit|edit source]

The following methods can provide a percentage of damage dealt as Hitpoints restoration, commonly referred to as life leech.

Life leech can occur actively through somespecial attacksor more passively through chance on-hit effects.

Item | Name | Type | Leech % | Method

 | Guthan's warspear | Passive | 25% | Equipping a full Guthan's set grants a 25% chance to heal for 100% of damage dealt.Additionally, with anamulet of the damnedequipped, the leech effect allows for over-healing Hitpoints up to 10 above the current maximum.

 | Guthan's helm

 | Guthan's platebody

 | Guthan's chainskirt

 | Blood Rush | Passive | 25% | Blood spellsheal for 25% of damage dealt. Anancient sceptreincreases this by 2.5%. Each piece ofBloodbark armourincreases it by 2% for a total of 10% with a full set. Ablood ancient sceptreallows for over-healing Hitpoints up to 10% above the current maximum.

 | Blood Burst

 | Blood Blitz

 | Blood Barrage

 | Sanguinesti staff | Passive | 8.33% | The built in spell has a 1/6 (~16.6%) chance to heal for 50% of damage dealt.

 | Amulet of blood fury | Passive | 6% | Melee attacks while wearing this amulet have a 20% chance to heal for 30% of the damage dealt.

 | Onyx bolts (e) | Passive | 2.75% | Hits with these bolts have a 11% chance (12.1% with completion of theHard Kandarin Diary) to heal for 25% of damage dealt.

 | Onyx dragon bolts (e)

 | Toxic blowpipe | Special | 50% | Heals for 50% of damage dealt.

 | Saradomin godsword | Special | 50% | Heals for 50% of damage dealt, always restoring a minimum of 10 Hitpoints.(Also restores 25% of damage as prayer points)

 | Ancient godsword | Special | 100% | Marks a target. If the target fails to move far enough away within 8 ticks (4.8 seconds) then 25 damage is dealt, and the player is healed for 15% of the target's hitpoints level, up to a cap.

Overheal[edit|edit source]

Temporary hitpoints boosts can be obtained through several means, but none provide a permanent boost to hitpoints. Boosted hitpoints levels above a player's maximum Hitpoints decay at a rate of one per minute, identically to othertemporary boosts. This timer can be restarted through activating theRapid Healprayer or through logging out, allowing a player to remain at a boosted hitpoints level for longer.

Self-inflicted damage[edit|edit source]

Players can damage themselves with some interactions with the following items. Non-lethal items cannot kill the player under normal circumstances. When using a non-lethal item which damage would result in taking lethal damage, either no damage will be dealt or the item cannot be used. However, lethal items can still be used to take lethal damage. Damage from non-lethal items may still result in death if it is taken at the same time as damage from another source. One example would be guzzling aDwarven rock cakeor feeling aLocator orb, both to inflict more than 50+ damage whilst drinking a dose of anoverloadpotion. Using this mechanic may be beneficial for using the maximum set effect of wearing all pieces ofDharok's armour setduringNightmare Zone.

Environment[edit|edit source]

Players can experience passive damage over time (and eventually die) through the environment at either theKharidian Desert, or inside greater fog whilst participating inLast Man Standing.

Kharidian Desert[edit|edit source]

Players who are in theKharidian Desertwill experienceDesert heat, except for those who have completed theElite Desert Diaryand are wearing theirDesert amulet 4. Players will need to bringWaterskinand weardesert-friendly clothingto prevent the player from taking up to 10 damage every 30-90 seconds (depending on the type of armour worn).

Last Man Standing[edit|edit source]

Players who participate in Last Man Standing will encounter fog markers; this will drive all of the remaining players into the middle of the minigame. If players are less than 16 tiles into the fog, they will take 1-3 damage every other tick, ramping up over 6 ticks. Players 16 or more tiles into the fog will be subject to greater fog, which can deal up to 10 damage every other tick. To prevent this, it is important to strategise by moving to a place that provides cover and concealment from both the fog and other players.

Earning experience[edit|edit source]

To earnexperiencein Hitpoints, a player has to fight, completequestswhich reward Hitpoints experience, or rubexperience lamps.

When fighting, be itMelee,Ranged, orMagic, a player will earn Hitpoints experience whenever damage is dealt. For every Hitpoint of damage dealt, 1.33 experience points are given to the player's Hitpoints. However, a few monsters give greatly reduced experience due to their ability to regenerate (an exception to this beingMonkey GuardsfromApe Atoll).

Trivia[edit|edit source]

InRuneScape Classic, all players started with level ten Hits and 1,000 experience - slightly fewer experience than would be required for level ten in all other skills. WhenRuneScape 2was released, accounts that had not gained the Hits experience needed to reach level ten or higher had their Hitpoints stat "corrected" to level nine. The only way to have level nine Hitpoints was to have created an account prior to the release ofRuneScape 2and not to have trained the Hitpoints skill since. The minimumcombat levelis still three for those players. However, since all accounts inOld School RuneScapestart fresh, no player inOld Schoolhas nine Hitpoints.Also inClassic, botters and rulebreakers were punished by having all their stats reset to one, resulting in a Hits level of one. This created level one accounts, which still exist inRuneScapetoday.
