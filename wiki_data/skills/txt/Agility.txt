Agilityis amembers-onlyskillwhich gives access to variousshortcutsaroundRuneScape. Other benefits of the skill include fasterrun energyrestoration, slower run energy dissipation while running and the ability to wear weight-saving outfits like thegraceful outfit, as well as wield certain tools and weaponry. Note that the passive benefits of faster energy restore and lower run energy drain rate also apply in free-to-play worlds.[1]

Agility training areas[edit|edit source]

Agility training areas are identified with a running figureiconon theworld map. These areas contain anAgility coursethat players will need to complete to train their Agility. An Agility course is completed by successfully passing all obstacles.

Failure[edit|edit source]

It is possible to fail an obstacle, which often results in the player taking small amounts of damage. Therefore, it is advised to bring somefoodwhen planning on training Agility at lower Agility andHitpointslevels.

On many courses, the amount of damage taken after failing an obstacle is based on your remainingHitpoints, so to conserve food it is often worthwhile to wait until your Hitpoints are low before eating. For example, with level 50 Hitpoints, falling into the lava in theWilderness coursemight cause 11 points of damage when at full health, but only 5 damage when at 20 health.

Failure is often more likely at lower Agility levels.Weightdoesnotaffect the chance of success for most obstacles.[2]However, there are a few obstacles which were differently coded for certain quests and activities, such as the Zip line from theWerewolf Agility Course.[3]

Stamina[edit|edit source]

For the best experience rates, it is required to continually keep running around the courses. This will drainrun energy, so bring a form of run energy restoration such asstamina potions. Keeping weight at 0 or as low as possible will reduce run energy consumption, so wearingweight-reducing clothingcan be helpful.

In particular, the fullgraceful outfitgives a total of 30% increased run energy restoration.

Regular courses[edit|edit source]

These courses consist of completing a circuit of obstacles.

Gnome Stronghold Agility Course[edit|edit source]

TheGnome Stronghold Agility Coursehas no requirements to access and is very easy to follow. Additionally, it is impossible to fail any of the obstacles at this course, so it is not necessary to bring anyfood. However, someenergy potions,super energy potionsorstamina potionsmay be helpful for faster training.

This course is located near theGrand Treein theTree Gnome Stronghold, north-west ofArdougne.

A lap will take a minimum of 34 seconds to complete. Therefore, the average experience per hour will be around 10,000, depending on the player's concentration.

Shayzien Agility Course[edit|edit source]

The Shayzien Agility Course is split into two Basic and Advanced course, with the former requiring 1 Agility and the latter requiring 45 Agility.
The basic course takes around 53 seconds to complete, yields 153.5 experience, with it also being very unlikely to fail any of the course's obstacles, making the average Agility experience per hour 8,750. 
The advanced course takes around 49 seconds and yields 507.5 experience, making the average Agility experience per hour around 30,000.

Penguin Agility Course[edit|edit source]

This Agility course requires level 30 Agility and is located on theIceberg, which requires completion ofCold Warto access. To get to the course, players need to transform into a penguin, which can be done by talking toLarrywith aclockwork suitin the inventory and choosing theTuxedo timeoption.

Due to the success rate of the obstacles, the experience rates scale with the player's Agility level. At higher levels expect to be able to complete around 55 laps per hour, resulting in 29,500–30,000 Agility experience per hour.

This course has the highest base chance to receive thegiant squirrel. At level 99 Agility, it would take an average of 130 hours to get the giant squirrel.

Barbarian Outpost Agility Course[edit|edit source]

The Barbarian Outpost Agility Course requires level 35 Agility and completion ofAlfred Grimhand's Barcrawlto access. This course is a lap-based obstacle course consisting of eight obstacles that players can traverse in return for Agility experience. If all obstacles are passed in the correct order, some bonus experience is rewarded at the end of the lap.

With an average time of 32 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 17,000 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 11,000-14,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

Ape Atoll Agility Course[edit|edit source]

The Ape Atoll Agility Course requires level 48 Agility and completion of Chapter 2 ofMonkey Madness Ito access. To train at this course, players need to transform into a monkey, which can be done by equipping aNinja monkey greegreeorKruk monkey greegree. This course is a lap-based obstacle course consisting of six obstacles that players can traverse in return for Agility experience. If all obstacles are passed in the correct order, some bonus experience is rewarded at the end of the lap.

With an average time of 39 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 53,300 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 40,000–50,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

Wilderness Agility Course[edit|edit source]

The Wilderness Agility Course requires level 52 Agility to access. However, this level is only needed to access the course through the gates; the minimum level requirement of the obstacles is level 49. Therefore, it is a popular method to access this course by using atemporary skill boostto access the course starting at level 47, since the experience per hour at this course is far superior to other courses available to these players. The Agility course consists of five obstacles that players can pass in return for Agility experience. If all obstacles are passed in the correct order, some bonus experience is rewarded at the end of the lap.

Since this Agility course is located deep in theWilderness, ranging from level 50 to 56, is it possible to come acrossplayer killerswhile training there. Additionally, there are two level 25skeletonsroaming the Agility course that will attack any player near them.

With an average time of 40 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 47,500 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 40,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

Colossal Wyrm Agility Course[edit|edit source]

The Colossal Wyrm Agility Course requires level 50 Agility and completion ofChildren of the Sunto access. The Agility course consists of a regular and an advanced course. After the second obstacle the player can choose to do one of the two courses. Selecting the tight rope will put the player on the basic course. The regular course consists of six obstacles and gives 504 xp per lap. At level 62 Agility the player can do the Advanced Course. If the player selects the ladder the player will be on the advanced course. The Advanced course consists of six obstacles and gives 685 xp per lap.

Players can expect to get up to 31,000 Agility experience per hour on the basic course, and up to 44,000 experience per hour on the advanced course. While this gives less experience per hour compared to other courses around the same level, the Colossal Wyrm Agility Course is a noticeably less click-intensive way to obtain amylase crystals compared to Rooftop Agility courses or the Brimhaven Agility Arena.

Werewolf Agility Course[edit|edit source]

The Werewolf Agility Course requires level 60 Agility and completion ofCreature of Fenkenstrainto access. To get to the course, players need to be wearing aring of charos. The Agility course consists of five obstacles that players can pass in return for Agility experience. If thestickis collected and turned in at the end of the lap, some bonus experience is rewarded. The only failable obstacle on this course is the notorious deathslide, which can hit over 30 damage.

This course offers the highest potential experience per hour rates of all Agility courses. However, it requires a lot more concentration than other courses offering pretty similar experience rates.

With an average time of 38 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 69,500 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 60,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

Prifddinas Agility Course[edit|edit source]

The Prifddinas Agility Course requires level 75 Agility and completion ofSong of the Elvesto access. The Agility course consists of twelve obstacles that players can pass in return for Agility experience. This Agility course is unique to other courses; in that, portals can appear at various points throughout the course. Entering these portals will teleport the player one or two obstacles further, slightly decreasing the time needed to complete the course and thus increasing the experience per hour rate. Additionally, approximately 45crystal shardscan be found per hour by entering these portals yielding up to732,825.00if makingDivine super combat potionswith 97Herblore.

With an average time of 72 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 66,000 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 60,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

Rooftop Agility courses[edit|edit source]

Rooftop Agility Courses were introduced toOld School RuneScapeon5 December2013. A total of nine courses have been released.

The rooftop Agility courses will provide the player withmarks of grace, which can be used to buy thegraceful outfitandamylase packsfromGrace.

Chances of obtaining marks of grace are reduced to 20% of the normal rate if the player's Agility level is 20 levels higher than the course requirement.[4]Until the player reaches that level, marks of grace will continue to spawn normally.[5]

Other courses[edit|edit source]

These courses consist of something else than just completing a circuit of obstacles.

Brimhaven Agility Arena[edit|edit source]

TheBrimhaven Agility Arenasets players the objective to tag Ticket Dispensers foragility arena ticketsandBrimhaven vouchers.
The Brimhaven Agility Arena consists of 25 pillars, with adjacent pillars being connected via Agility obstacles. 24 of these pillars contain a ticket dispenser. Every minute, one of these ticket dispensers will be activated, and the player should try to find their way to this activated dispenser by traversing the Agility obstacles as quickly as possible.

The tickets and vouchers can be traded in toPirate Jackie the Fruit, with the Agility arena tickets being exchanged for Agility experience and the Brimhaven voucher being exchanged for a selection of items.

The best experience per hour rates will be achieved by non-stop completing Agility obstacles during the waiting time for the active ticket dispenser to move, making it possible to achieve experience rates upwards of 67,000 Agility experience per hour at level 99 Agility. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 50,000-60,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on Agility and concentration levels.

Agility Pyramid[edit|edit source]

TheAgility Pyramidlocated in theKharidian Desertis available to players with level 30 Agility. On this course, players start at the bottom of a pyramid with the goal of reaching the top, where they are able to collect thepyramid top. Before reaching the top, players will have to successfully traverse each of the five layers of the pyramid. These layers are filled with obstacles however, forcing the player back to the previous layer upon failing to pass them.

Pyramid tops may be handed in toSimon Templetonin exchange for10,000.

Level 75 Agility or higher will prevent the player from failing any of the obstacles, making it possible to complete a maximum of 26 laps per hour, which will reward a maximum of 44,700 experience per hour.

Dorgesh-Kaan[edit|edit source]

TheDorgesh-Kaan Agility Courselocated inDorgesh-Kaanis available to players with level 70 Agility and completion ofDeath to the Dorgeshuun. The basic premise of the course is to cross obstacles using one of two routes to retrieve an item requested byTurgall. One route will focus on purely training Agility, while the other course will mainly rewardRangedexperience.

With an average time of 2:36 minutes per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 63,000 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 50,000–60,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

While having very similar experience rates per hour to theArdougne Rooftop Course, the chance to get thegiant squirrelpet is around 15% higher at the Dorgesh-Kaan Agility Course.

Hallowed Sepulchre[edit|edit source]

TheHallowed Sepulchrelocated inDarkmeyeris available to players with 52 Agility and completion ofSins of the Father. Once an ancientSaradoministburial ground, the Sepulchre consists of five floors, unlocked at 52, 62, 72, 82, and 92 agility. On each floor, players must actively navigate through obstacles and reach the end before a timer expires. On each floor, the player can choose to loot coffins and receiveHallowed marks, or to continue without looting and achieve higher experience rates. The hallowed marks can be exchanged for unique rewards, such asdark dyesfor recolouring thegraceful outfitor thedark acornfor recolouring thegiant squirrel.

Other training methods[edit|edit source]

Barbarian Fishing[edit|edit source]

Barbarian Fishing grants passive Agility experience, between 1/10th and 1/12th of the Fishing experience for each fish caught. Players can earn 2,000-5,000 experience in both Agility and Strength per hour, in addition to the Fishing experience gained.

Blast Furnace[edit|edit source]

The multiplayer Blast Furnace minigame has a facility to operate a belt to transport ores into the furnace. This rewards 1 Agility experience pergame tick, for a maximum of 6,000 experience per hour. This will quickly drain run energy, however.

Gnome Ball[edit|edit source]

Gnome Ball is a small members-only minigame in which one or more players aim to score goals against gnomes. This is done by throwing the gnome ball into the goal.Rangedexperience is gained each time the ball is thrown, while both Ranged and Agility experience are rewarded when a goal is scored. When you enter the field, you should talk to the referee to get the rules, and how to play.

Toy mouse[edit|edit source]

Atoy mousecan be made on aCrafting tablein aplayer-owned house, or rarely attracted while wearing anAva's accumulator. Winding, releasing and catching it will reward 3 Agility experience each time.

Underwater Agility and Thieving[edit|edit source]

TheUnderwater Agility and Thievingactivity located in theUnderwaterarea ofFossil Islandcombines the Agility andThievingskills. In this activity, players swim around looking for openedtreasure chestsandgiant clam shells. Searching these chests and clams will reward the player withmermaid's tearsandglistening tears, which can be exchanged for several items and Agility and/or Thieving experience respectively.

The experience rates scale quadratically with the player's Agility and Thieving levels. Therefore, it is not recommended to do this method at lower levels. At level 99 in both skills, the estimated experience per hour is 38,800 Agility and 142,300 Thieving experience per hour.

Werewolf Skullball[edit|edit source]

Skullball is played in the Werewolf agility area east ofCanifis. Level 25 Agility and aring of charosare required to access this activity.

To play, talk to theSkullball bossat the start of the course. From there, the challenge is to kick the ball through a course of 10 obstacles and score a goal. To kick the ball, right click on it and select how far to kick it. A tap advances the ball 1 space, a kick is 5 spaces, and shoot is 10 spaces. There is also an option of having the map highlighting the goal.

When successfully completing the course, an experience reward will be received, based on the completion time of the course. If it's under 4 minutes, a maximum of 750 experience will be rewarded. Any more and the experience becomes less.

Wintertodt Pillars[edit|edit source]

From level 60 Agility onwards, it is possible to train Agility by repeatedly using the gap-jumpshortcutin theWintertodt's prison. Each jump gives 18 experience, making it a good way to get a bit of Agility experience while waiting for the Wintertodt to spawn. If focusing solely on training Agility here, the player can expect experience rates of up to 21,000 Agility experience per hour. Keep in mind that the Wintertodt is a dangerous boss, so it is recommended to bring multiple pieces ofwarm clothingand sufficientfood.

Run energy[edit|edit source]

Agility level reduces the rate at whichrun energydrains while running, and increases energy regeneration while standing still. Energy is also affected by temporary boosts to agility,stamina potions, and certain items such as thegraceful outfitandring of endurance.

Internally, energy is stored as a number between 0 and 10,000 and is updated every tick based on the following formula.

While running, energy will drain each tick based on the player's Agility level and totalweight:

While stationary or walking, energy will regenerate each tick based on the player's Agility level:

At 99 agility players are able to run roughly 49% longer and restore energy roughly 65% faster than at level 1.
