Smithingis a productionskillthrough which players create a wide variety of metal items fromoreand metalbars. It is the companion skill ofMining, which generates raw materials used in Smithing. Ores acquired from Mining are smelted into metal bars atfurnaces, and thenhammeredintoitemsatanvils. Many smithable items are useful incombat,quests, and the training of a number of other skills such asCraftingandFletching.

Smelting[edit|edit source]

Smelting is the process of extracting a metalbarfrom a metalore. To obtain a metal bar, a player must use an ore of the desired metal with afurnace. Some metals require multiple ores, and some requirecoalto be added to the furnace to raise the furnace's temperature.

Metal bars can be smelted by either using ores directly on a furnace or by clicking on the furnace, right-clicking on the desired bar to smelt, and selecting the number of bars to smelt.

Memberscan also smelt bars at theBlast Furnace, which can be a quicker and more cost-effective alternative to usual smelting at a furnace.

Smelting using Magic[edit|edit source]

With level 43Magic, players can smeltbarsusing theSuperheat Itemspell. Doing so grants the same amount of Smithingexperienceas smelting using a furnace, and has a few advantages:

The player can emerge from aminewith a near full inventory of bars (aside from the spaces taken by nature runes and either fire rune or staff of fire), instead of a full inventory of ores which will smelt into only a fraction of the bars.The player receives both Smithing and Magic experience.The player saves time by not having to commute between abankand afurnace.The player is granted a 100% success rate in smeltingiron ore.The player can smeltLovakite barswithout the need to use the specialLovakite furnace.

Success rate[edit|edit source]

All metals have a 100% success rate with the exception ofiron ore, which has a 50% chance of success, regardless of level; however, wearing aring of forging, using theSuperheat Itemspell, or using theBlast Furnaceprovides a 100% success rate for smithingiron bars. A failed smelting attempt results in the loss of the iron ore.

Smithing[edit|edit source]

Smithing is the process by which players craft ametalitem out of one or more metalbars. Smithing is always done at ananvil, using ahammeror animcando hammer. When a player clicks on an anvil or uses a metal bar with one, an overlay is shown in which the player selects which item to forge. The player can either click the item to smith one such item, or right-click on the item and select a higher quantity of items to smith. Smithing takes place at a time interval of 5ticks(roughly 3 seconds) per item created, regardless of the items being created or how many bars are being used per item.  Each piece of theSmiths' Uniformgives a 20% chance to speed up actions performed at an anvil by 1 tick (from 5 to 4), up to a 100% chance with the full set.

Smithing tables[edit|edit source]

Different Smithing levels are required to make different items. Below is a table with information about Smithing and what players can create. It is important to note thatblack armour and weaponscannotbe smithed.

Smithing experience is calculated by taking the experience granted from 1 bar and multiplying it by the number of bars used. For example, abronze platebodyis 62.5 experience using 5 bars. 1 bar is 12.5 exp, so go 5 * 12.5 = 62.5. This works for all bars and all smithing items, with a few exceptions such ascannonballs.

Minigames[edit|edit source]

TheBlast Furnaceis a special furnace that takes half the usual amount ofcoalto smelt bars, and processes all loaded ore at once instead of one by one. Other players must be operating and repairing various parts of the furnace in order to power it, but on designated blast furnaceworlds, there are non-players characters who perform this action in exchange for payment.

TheGiants' Foundryis an activity in which players take commissions to smith giant swords from bars or recycled metal items. These swords must be hammered, ground and polished at precise temperatures, which can be controlled by dipping it in water or lava. The player is rewarded with smithing experience,coinsandFoundry Reputation.

Other smithing activities[edit|edit source]

Players fightingZalcanohave to refinetephraat the furnace in her prison, and will deal more damage with a higher smithing level.Barronite depositscan be crushed (yielding 30 XP per deposit) to recoverbarronite shardsand a variety of items at thebarronite crusherinCamdozaal.Elemental shields,elemental helmets,mind helmetsandmind shieldscan be smithed at theworkbenchesin theElemental Workshop.Sigils from theCorporeal Beastcan be affixed toBlessed spirit shieldsand theElidinis' wardto create powerful shields.Godsword blades,dragonfire shields,dragonfire wardsandancient wyvern shieldscan be assembled at regular anvils.Dragon platebodiesanddragon kiteshieldscan be made from their components at theDragon Forge.Bandosian componentscan be combined with the damagedTorva full helm,platebody, andplatelegsat ananvilto createTorva armour.Iron barscan be made intoiron sheetsfor little experience and then exchanged for very little money in thePiscatoris Fishing Colony.

Smelting and Smithing tips[edit|edit source]

The closestfurnacesto abankare theShilo Villageor thePrifddinasfurnace formembersand theEdgevillefurnace forfree players. The F2P title was held by theAl Kharidfurnace until anupdateon15 November2018. However, the furnace at Shilo Village costscoinsto use before the completion of the eliteKaramja Diary, so many players find theEdgevillefurnace preferable or thePrifddinasfurnace onceSong of the Elveshas been completed. ThePort Phasmatys,NeitiznotandFaladorfurnaces are also all quite close to banks. The Edgeville furnace also gives a chance to smelt two ores at once while wearing Varrock armour with each completed set ofVarrock Diary.It is often more efficient to break up the tasks ofmining, smelting (unlesssuperheating), and smithing, rather than trying to mine 28ores, smelt them, and then smith them (although in Al Kharid the furnace is on the way to the bank).Theanvilslocated nearest a bank are at the south-east area ofPrifddinas, theVoid Knights' Outpost,Yanille(just south of the bank), andVarrock(just south of the west bank). To reach the Void Knights' Outpost island, talk to the squire south of thePort Sarimdock or use theMinigame teleporttoPest Control.

Making money[edit|edit source]

Smithing offers several opportunities to make money. Players have the option to castHigh Level Alchemyon the items they made with smithing, sell them to specialtygeneral stores, or sell them on theGrand Exchange. Furthermore, members have the ability to smelt metalbarsat theBlast Furnacefor lowered ore costs and therefore greater profits.

Smithing in conjunction with casting High Level Alchemy is responsible for bringing significant amount of coins into the game. At aMagiclevel of 55, a player can "high alch" items using 5fire runesand 1nature runeto turn items into coins. Several items made by Smithing can be profitable whenHigh Alchemyis cast on them. Some high alchemy values are found in the table below.

Specialty stores are general stores that purchase items from the player for more coins than most general stores. TheJiminua's Jungle Storenorth ofTai Bwo Wannaivillage onKaramjawith theKaramja gloves3/4purchases items at above the high alchemy value.

Other stores include: the general store run byMartin Thwaitin theRogues' Den(Martin Thwait's Lost and Found), theWest Ardougne General Store, and theBandit Duty Freein theBandit Campin theWilderness(although this one isNOTrecommended due to its dangerous location). Keep in mind that the buy price at general stores decreases rapidly the more items it has in stock, so it's recommended to hop around frequently if you decide to sell your items.

Other ways for making money include at level 40 Smithing with level 6Craftingand anecklace mould,gold necklacecan be made at the same furnace in whichgold oreis smelted intogold bars.Grum's Gold ExchangeinPort Sarimbuys a gold necklace for 315 coins if his stock is zero; the price decreases 9 coins for each gold necklace in stock, dropping to 45 coins at a stock of 30 or more
