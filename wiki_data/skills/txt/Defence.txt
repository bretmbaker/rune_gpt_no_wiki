Mechanics[edit|edit source]

The higher a target's Defence level, the less likely one is to land successful attacks (MeleeorRanged-based damage greater than zero, orMagic-based offensive spells that don'tSplash) against said target. As such, it is a vital skill in high-levelPvMandPvPsituations. Defencedoes notdecrease the amount of damage that an opponent can deal against you.

A player's Ranged level will not increase their ranged defence, but magical defence is different - it is based on 70% of the player'sMagiclevel, while the remaining 30% is the player's Defence level, which is then followed by the player's magical defence bonus from theirarmour.

Defence is one of the skills that will raise thecombat levelof a player regardless of other skill levels. For this reason, manycombat pureslevel Defence to a certain level then stop training it to minimise their combat level, giving them an upper hand in Player-versus-Player combat against players around their level. Notable Defence levels are often tied to specific tiers of items or prayers that lead to advantages in combat. To see a complete list of viable optimised Defence level, check theDefence level caps.

Equipment[edit|edit source]

Almost every single piece ofcombat equipment(except for the ones that go on theweapon,cape,ring, andamulet slots) requires a certain Defence level to wear. Here are links to tables of armour and equipment that require a Defence level to wear:

Armour- For an overview on the different types of armour.Melee armour- An overview of the different types of Melee armour.Magic armour- An overview of the different types of Magic armour.Ranged armour- An overview of the different types of Ranged armour.Prayer armour- An overview of the different types of Prayer armour.Defenders- Aweaponthat goes on theshield slotand provides offensive bonuses while also having anAttackand Defence levels requirement. Therune defenderprovides the same strength bonus as anobsidian shield, while only requiring 40 Defence as opposed to 60.
