Runecraft, also calledRunecrafting, is askillthat allows players to craft their ownrunesforMagicspells. Theexperienceearned from making runes is small, and due to the need for constant running and banking, it is fairly click and attention intensive. Because of constant demand for different types of runes, it can create a generous profit.

With the release of theBloodandSoul Altarson7 January 2016, training Runecraft has become less time consuming for high-level runecrafters, withblood runesreaching experience rates of around 38,000 per hour andsoul runesreaching up to around 47,000 experience per hour. Alternatively, if the player is willing to put in the effort,lava runescan be crafted for between 68,000 and 75,000 experience per hour from level 75 and up. TheGuardians of the Riftminigame, unlocked after theTemple of the Eyequest, is a popular alternative to traditional runecrafting offering experience rates of up to 55,000 experience per hour.

Crafting runes[edit|edit source]

In the Runecraft skill, magicalrunesare crafted by binding the magical energy fromrunic altarsinto magical stones. These stones are called essence. There are various types of essence, with each of these types being able to be crafted in a selection of runes.

Essence[edit|edit source]

The types of essence arerune essence,pure essence,daeyalt essence,dark essence fragmentsandblood essence. Besides these types of essence, there are three types ofcoresthat can be crafted into specific runes.

Rune essence[edit|edit source]

Rune essence can be used to craftair,mind,water,earth,fire, andbody runes.

Rune essence can be acquired by mining and frommonster drops.

Mining rune essence requires completion of theRune Mysteriesquest. After completing this quest, aselection of wizardscan teleport the player to therune essence mine, where the player can mine theRune Essenceto obtain rune essence for the Runecraft skill.

Rune essence can be obtained by mining byfree-to-playplayers and bymembersthat have aMininglevel lower than 30.

Pure essence[edit|edit source]

Pure essencecan be used to craftair,mind,water,earth,fire, andbody runesas well ascosmic,chaos,astral,nature,law,death,blood, andwrath runes.

Pure essence can be obtained by mining and frommonster drops.

Mining pure essence requires completion of theRune Mysteriesquest. After completing this quest, aselection of wizardscan teleport the player to therune essence mine, where the player can mine theRune Essenceto obtain pure essence for the Runecraft skill.

Pure essence can be obtained by mining only bymembersthat are level 30 or higher in theMiningskill. However,free-to-playplayers can obtain via trading with other players.

Daeyalt essence[edit|edit source]

Daeyalt essencecan be used instead of pure essence, to craft the same runes as with pure essence. Doing so grants a 50% bonus in experience gained from creating these runes. This effect also applies to runes crafted at theOurania Altar.

Daeyalt essence can only be obtained from theDaeyalt essence mineinDarkmeyer. Access to the essence mine requires completion ofSins of the Father. Shards can be converted to daeyalt essence by tradingNoranna Tytaninlocated near the entrance of the mine at a 1:1 ratio. Any essence received is sent to the bank. To trade in the shards for daeyalt essence, a version of thevyre noble disguiseneeds to be worn.

Dark essence fragments[edit|edit source]

Dark essence fragmentscan be used to craftbloodandsoul runes.

Collecting dark essence fragments requires level 38Miningand 38Craftingor higher. The ability to use the dark essence fragments to craft runes requires level 77 Runecraft or higher.

Dark essence fragments require a few steps to obtain. In thedense essence minemine thedense runestonesto obtaindense essence blocks. This requires apickaxeand achisel. Bring these dense essence blocks to theDark Altarto bind its energy into the blocks. This will turn the dense essence blocks intodark essence blocks. Use a chisel on the dark essence blocks to obtain dark essence fragments.

Blood essence[edit|edit source]

Blood essencecannot be used to craft runes; instead, it offers the chance to craft an extrablood runeper pure essence, daeyalt essence or dark essence fragment when activated.

Blood essence is an uncommon drop from bothNexand theTombs of Amascut. It can also be obtained as a rare drop from certain monsters in theAncient Prison, and may be found inside theIntricate pouchreward from theGuardians of the Riftminigame.

Cores[edit|edit source]

Cores can be used to craftmind runes(usingMind cores),body runes(usingBody cores) andchaos runes(usingChaos cores). For each type of rune, the corresponding core needs to be used. A core acts as 10 pure or rune essence. For example, at level 2 runecraft, one mind core would give 10 mind runes and 55 experience, and at level 98 runecraft, one mind core would give 80 mind runes and still 55 experience.

Cores are dropped by thegolemsin theRuins of Camdozaal. Each core is dropped by the corresponding golem.

Mind cores are dropped byMind Golems.Body cores are dropped byBody Golems.Chaos cores are dropped byChaos Golems.

Talismans[edit|edit source]

Talismansare quite important in the runecrafting skill, as they are the keys used to access most altars. Each one is magically attuned to theRunic altarthat shares its name. Anair talisman, for example, is attuned to theAir Altar. A player may use the talisman only on its corresponding 'mysterious ruin', to repeatedly reach the altar inside. Talismans can be acquired from drops or bytradingwith other players.

A talisman exists for theair,mind,water,earth,fire,body,cosmic,chaos,nature,law,death,bloodandWrath Altar.

Talisman tiaras[edit|edit source]

A talisman can be fused with atiarainto a talisman tiara. This creates an equipable item that lets the player left-click on the corresponding mysterious ruins to enter, and saves an inventory space. Theelementalandcatalytic talismansare instead combined with aGold tiara.

Altars[edit|edit source]

Runic altarsare locations at which players can use the Runecraft skill to turn essence into runes. Each altar corresponds to a different type of rune.

Regular altars[edit|edit source]

Most altars are located in another dimension, accessible through Mysterious Ruins scattered across the surface ofGielinor. This includes theair,mind,water,earth,fire,body,cosmic,chaos,nature,law,death,bloodandwrathaltars. TheAstral Altaris the only regular altar that is not accessed through Mysterious Ruins.

Mysterious Ruins are not labelled on theworld map. Players can discover the ruins' location by clicking 'locate' on atalisman. Atalisman,tiara, orrunecraft capeis required to actually enter the ruins and use the altars.

When a player clicks on the altar, all essence in their inventory are converted to a type of rune (depending on the altar), and they gain Runecraft experience. They can also enchant atiaraif they have a normal tiara and talisman in their inventory. Use either the tiara or the talisman on the altar to combine them into an enchanted tiara.

Kourend blood and soul altars[edit|edit source]

Thebloodandsoulaltars can be found inArceuus, near thedense essence mine. No talisman or tiara is needed to use these altars as they are in the regular dimension.

Ourania Altar[edit|edit source]

TheOurania Altar, also known as theZMIAltar, convertspure essenceinto an assortment of random runes, with a chance of bonus runes being created if players have themedium Ardougne Diarycompleted. The altar, which requires no talisman or tiara to enter, gives roughly 1.7 times the normal experience for each pure essence used. Rune essence cannot be used. Players do not need a specific Runecraft level in order to craft at this altar, but the chance of crafting higher-levelled runes increases with a higher Runecraft level. Players cannot craftsunfire runesorwrath runesthrough the Ourania Altar; these are the only runes uncraftable at the Altar outside of combination runes.

Abyss[edit|edit source]

TheAbyssis a special region that provides access to mostrunic altarswithout the need for atalisman. Access to the Abyss requires completion of theEnter the Abyssminiquest. The Abyss consists of two rings: a dangerous outer ring in amultiway combat zoneand a safe inner ring with rifts leading to the runic altars. Aside from theabyssal monstersinhabiting it, using the Abyss is also dangerous because players who enter the Abyss will have theirPrayerpoints drained to 0, and players who enter without wearing anAbyssal braceletwill also be immediately given askull.

Multiple runes[edit|edit source]

As a player's Runecraft level increases, they can make morerunes. However, they only earnexperiencebased on the amount of essence they use. The number of runes made from the essence in a player's inventory in an action that gains a level is determined by the player's level before the runecrafting action, even if crafting the same amount of essence one piece at a time would yield more runes. For example, a player with a Runecraft level of 22 will craft 3 air runes for eachpure essenceused.

TheRaiments of the Eye, obtainable from playingGuardians of the Rift, grant 10% more runes per piece, with a 20% set bonus for a total of 60% when the full outfit is worn.

Combination runes[edit|edit source]

Memberscan combine two elemental runes into a combination rune. To craft combination runes, a player needs to take existingrunesthat are one half of the combination, with a matchingtalisman(not atiara), along with an equal amount ofpure essenceto thealtarwhich comprises the other half of the combination. Use the existing runes or the talisman for the existing runes on the altar. This has a 50% chance of success per rune, and any failed runes are simply destroyed. The talisman will be consumed regardless of how many runes are made. Wearing abinding necklacegrants a 100% chance of successfully creating combination runes.

The player may use theLunar spellMagic Imbueto make combination runes without needing the opposing talisman. Using binding necklaces and Magic Imbue to craftlava runesoffers the highest Runecraftexperienceper hour.

Level | Rune | Combination | Exp (Low) | Exp (High) | GE Price

6 |  | Mist rune | + | 8 | 8.5 | 123

10 |  | Dust rune | + | 8.3 | 9 | 9

13 |  | Mud rune | + | 9.3 | 9.5 | 109

15 |  | Smoke rune | + | 8.5 | 9.5 | 54

19 |  | Steam rune | + | 9.3 | 10 | 100

23 |  | Lava rune | + | 10 | 10.5 | 27

Players receive less experience at the lower-levelled altars. For example, making mist runes at the Air Altar will give 8 experience for each rune made, while making them at the Water Altar will give 8.5 experience for each rune made.

Essence pouches[edit|edit source]

Essence poucheshold varying amounts ofrune,pure,daeyaltorguardian essence. Essence pouches can be used to take larger loads when crafting runes or mining essence.

Essence pouches decay with use, and must be repaired by visiting theDark magein the centre of the Abyss (or by contacting him with theNPC ContactLunar spell) or they will disappear. The pouches do not have to be brought directly to the Dark Mage in order to be repaired; any and all pouches that are stored in the bank will also be repaired.

Essence pouches are dropped by monsters in theAbyssand theAbyssal Areaafter completion of theEnter the Abyssminiquest.

Type | Runecraft Level | Capacity | Cumulative capacity | Uses before decay (approx.) | Dropped or Obtained by

 | Small pouch | 1 | 3 | 3 | No decay | Abyssal guardian,leech,walker, orDark mage

 | Medium pouch | 25 | 6 | 9 | 45 | Abyssal guardian,leech,walker

 | Large pouch | 50 | 9 | 18 | 29 | Abyssal guardian,leech,walker

 | Giant pouch | 75 | 12 | 30 | 10 | Abyssal guardian,leech,walker

 | Colossal pouch | 25-85[note] | 40 | 40 | 8 | Created using all previous pouches and anabyssal needle

Runecraft pet[edit|edit source]

TheRift guardianis a skillingpetthat can be obtained while training Runecraft. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Runecraft level, the rune the player is crafting, and the number of essence used.
