Pickpocketing[edit|edit source]

Pickpocketing is the act of walking up to anNPCand right-clicking them, then selectingPickpocket. A successful pickpocket grants Thievingexperienceand loot. Failing a pickpocket will make the NPC damage the player andstunthem for several seconds. While stunned, the player cannot pickpocket or move. Because of the possibility for damage, bringfoodto heal the damage taken.

Coins obtained via pickpocketing are obtained viacoin pouches. Players can have a stack of up to 28 coin pouches in their inventory, after which they must open them before they can pickpocket more. Players can quickly open a stack of coin pouches with a single left-click. After completion of theArdougne Achievement Diariesplayers are able to stack more than 28 pouches, with the max being 140 after completion of the elite Ardougne Diary.

NPCs may be pickpocketed every two ticks (1.2 seconds). There is no need to wait until the pickpocket animation is finished before pickpocketing again. Another attempt may be performed as soon as the sound of the item entering the player'sinventoryis played and the experience is given.

Eating food while stunned will extend the time before the player can pickpocket again by the food's attack delay. To avoid losing time because of this delay, time eating directly after successfully pickpocketing.

A useful trick that allows pickpocket spamming is by going to the Controls (Joystick) settings tab and changing the attack option priority to 'Always right-click'. This effectively changes the left-click option from "Attack" to "Pickpocket" for most NPCs. To avoid accidentally attacking NPCs, the player can also equip abowwithoutarrows.

For NPCs with a right-click "Pickpocket" option unaffected by the previous tip, such aselves, the player may change their game client layout to "Resizable", then orient their camera so that the NPC is close to the bottom of their screen. In the correct position, the player should be able to right-click to open the interaction menu, then left-click to pickpocket without moving their mouse down to select the option.

Equipment[edit|edit source]

Wearing certainequipmentgrants benefits to pickpocketing.

Therogue outfitgrants a chance of getting double loot when pickpocketing NPCs. Wearing the full set guarantees getting double loot. It does not increase success rate.Thegloves of silenceincreases the success rate of pickpocketing by 5%. Degrade, but can be repaired. RequiresHunterlevel 54 to wear.Dodgy necklaceprovides a 25% chance to avoid being stunned and taking damage when failing a pickpocket. Each necklace has 10 charges.TheThieving capeor theMax capewill provide an additional 10% chance of being successful when pickpocketing NPCs.While wearing parts ofH.A.M. outfit, players are less likely to be kicked out of theH.A.M. Hideoutwhen failing to pick the pockets of H.A.M. members. This does not increase pickpocketing success rates, however.

Other effects[edit|edit source]

TheShadow Veilspell from theArceuus spellbookprovides a 15% chance to avoid being stunned and taking damage when failing a pickpocket. RequiresMagiclevel 47 and duration scales with Magic level.

Completing themedium Ardougne Diarygrants a 10% increased success rate for pickpocketing NPCs inArdougne. This bonus is extended to all NPCs aroundGielinorafter completing thehard Ardougne Diary. The Ardougne cloak does not need to be equipped or be in the inventory to get this bonus.

Stalls[edit|edit source]

There are a large number of stalls throughoutRuneScape, many of which can be found in theArdougne Market. Unlike pickpocketing, stealing from stalls has a 100% success rate as long as you are not in the line of sight of the stall owner or any of the nearbyguards. If you are, the stall owner will call over a guard who will begin to attack you.

After successfully stealing from a stall, their respective owners will refuse to interact the player until 10 consecutive in-game minutes have passed since the last theft from their stall. Time passed while logged out does not count toward removing this restriction. This extends to any NPC that owns the same type of stall, not just the one you stole from.

Multiple players can steal from the same stall, provided they do so on the samegame tick.

Chests[edit|edit source]

There arechestsscattered throughoutRuneScape. Some chests will have traps on them, which must be disarmed before looting them. To disarm a trap, select the "Search for traps" option from the drop-down menu.

After a player steals from a chest, they will need to wait before they can do so again. If "Search for traps" is not selected when attempting to open a trapped chest, the player will attempt to open the chest and take damage; this damage scales off of your current health down to a minimum.

Training strategies[edit|edit source]

Thieving minigames[edit|edit source]

There are a number ofminigameswhich are based on or include Thieving.

Pyramid Plunder- the desert citySophanemhas a pyramid where you can thieve for artefacts. As you get further into the pyramid, higher Thieving is required but it brings increasing amounts of Thievingexperience. This is one of the fastest methods to train Thieving.Blackjack- another Thieving activity in thedesert.Rogues' Den- Traverse a maze with Thieving andAgilityobstacles. Modest experience. More interesting for thieves is to open the safes in the dungeon. Good for experience and for the gems that you obtain as loot. Completing the maze also has a chance of rewarding you with theRogue outfit, which when worn will double the loot you receive from pickpocketing.Sorceress's Garden- An interesting game where you dodgeguardsand try to get fruit. Requires patience, a bit of skill, and experience, but yields excellent experience. It has four levels, each giving increased experience at levels 1, 25, 45, and 65. Bring apestle and mortarand a large amount of emptybeer glasses(can be obtained for free at the shelves in theSorcerer's house).Stealing artefacts- located inPort Piscarilius, players with level 49 Thieving can talk toCaptain Khaledto engage in stealing artefacts from those living in the residential district. It's a good way to train Thieving whilefletchingammo oralching. Requires alockpickor ahair clipto steal artefacts, and experience rate scales based on level.Stealing valuables- located inCivitas illa Fortis, players with level 50 Thieving can stealhouse keysand lootvaluablesfromwealthy citizens, which can be then given toOrianafor monetary rewards.

Thieving pet[edit|edit source]

Rockyis a skillingpetthat can be obtained when training theThievingskill. This includes stealing from stalls, pickpocketing from NPCs, picking fruit in theSorceress's Gardenand looting grand gold chests withinPyramid Plunder. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Thieving level, and the person/object the player is stealing from.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Thieving is one of the many skills that does not require any items for training, unless the player is blackjacking, breaking into homes in Varlamore, or lockpicking.Picking locks has a random chance of numbing your fingers, which will result in a temporary debuff to your thieving skill. It takes roughly 1 minute per point lost to wear off.
