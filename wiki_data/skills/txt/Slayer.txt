Slayeris askillthat allows players to killmonstersthat may otherwise be untargetable by players (players will be prompted a message stating they do not possess the required Slayer level to attack the monster). Players must visit aSlayer Master, who will assign them ataskto kill certain monsters based on the player'sCombat level. Slayerexperienceis awarded each time the player kills an assigned monster, and is equal to the monster'sHitpointsmultiplied by itsexperience bonus.

Many players primarily trainCombatby completingSlayer tasks, as Combat experience is still given as normal while fightingSlayer monsters. At high levels, Slayer is a very profitable skill to train, as high levelled Slayer monsters, such asSlayer bosseshave a multitude of both rare and valuable drops. Completing a task also rewards a player withSlayer points, which can be exchanged for various rewards and benefits at a Slayer master.

Introduction[edit|edit source]

To receive aSlayer task, players must visit one of nineSlayer MastersthroughoutRuneScape. All but two Slayer Masters have aCombat levelrequirement, and the final Slayer Master also has a Slayer level requirement. The tasks assigned are generally appropriate for the Combat level of the player, assuming they use the highest level Master available. Players may be assigned normal monsters to kill, or they may be assigned monsters that require the use of Slayer-specificitemsto deal damage or Slayer-specificarmourto prevent stat reduction.

TheSlayer equipmentnecessary to kill Slayer monsters can be purchased from any Slayer Master. When you get your task, you can ask the Master for advice on killing the assigned monsters, and they will tell you if special equipment is required. If no special equipment is necessary, they will give you other tips or advice such as if the monster is weak topoisonorMagic.

One of the things the Masters sell is anenchanted gem. Once you start training (this involves some begging from your chosen Master), you get one for free. Afterwards, you can buy them for 1coineach. These allow you to contact your Slayer Master, ask for tips, ask who the monster is and where it is located, and most importantly, see how many monsters you still have to kill before completing the task. The gems cannot be used to get a new assignment; for that, you must see a Master in person. An alternative to the gem is acombat bracelet, which will update the player every 10 kills while worn.

Players who have unlocked theLunar Spellscan also use theNPC Contactspellin order to receive a new assignment from a Slayer Master of their choosing. The Slayer gems automatically contact the Slayer Master most suited to your combat level; this may not be the one who gave you the assignment. It is advised to receive tasks from the Slayer Master the gems contact for you.

The Masters vary in the level of difficulty of their assignments; several of them require certain combat levels before you may get assignments from them. If you go to a Slayer Master that is too hard for you,TuraelinBurthorpemay consider giving you an easier assignment if the task is something that he doesn't normally assign. For example, ifVannakaassigns youdesert lizards, then Turael cannot change your task, as he too assigns desert lizards. The Masters are shown on themapwith a yellow skullicon.

Note:Skipping assignments through Turael isnota recommended choice, as it's better to gainSlayer pointsfrom doing tasks in a row and spending it on blocking or skipping your current task without breaking your task streak, as Slayer points also allow you to buy useful items and perks.

Slayer Masters[edit|edit source]

A handful ofSlayer Mastersdot the map; each Master gives assignments oriented towards a general range ofCombat levels.

Name | Image | Location | Requirements | Details

Turael |  |  | None | South-eastBurthorpe-Games necklaceteleport orHot-air balloonTurael'stasksare simple, small, and easy to find. These assignments are excellent for the Slayer with a low combat level, but his assignments yield such low experience that most players find him unsatisfactory.However, Turael is willing to replace an assignment given by another Slayer Master with an easier one, if the task to be replaced wouldn't normally be given by him (for example, he will replace a player'sBlack demontask but not aCrawling Handtask). This ability results in more players using his services than normally would.If the player has completedWhile Guthix Sleeps, he is replaced with his sister,Aya.

Spria |  |  | A Porcine of InterestQuest | Draynor Village -Amulet of gloryteleportSpriashares nearly the same task list with Turael, though she can also assign sourhogs and cannot reset the player's current task streak.

Krystilia |  |  | None | Edgeville-Amulet of gloryteleportKrystilia'stasksare monsters found within theWilderness.Onlymonsters slain within the Wilderness count towards her tasks. She will assign players any task on her listwithoutregard to the player's Combat level. Monsters killed during her tasks have the ability to dropSlayer enchantmentsandLarran's keysto compensate for this.Assignments from her have a separate task completion counter to standard assignments, so players will have to complete five of herSlayer tasksto begin earningSlayer reward points.

Mazchna |  |  | 20Combat,Priest in Peril | North-eastCanifison the bridge -Ectophial,fairy ringCKSorKharyrll Teleport(can be via house)Mazchnagives fairly easytaskstoo, but sometimes he may give a very small amount of more difficult monsters. Mazchna also has the habit of giving assignments which can be completed very close to him, making it convenient to get new assignments once completed.DuringWhile Guthix Sleeps, he is replaced byAchtryn.

Vannaka |  |  | 40Combat | Edgeville Dungeon, east of theWildernessgate -Paddewwa TeleportorAmulet of gloryVannakais one of the most popularSlayer Masters. Histasksare usually suitable for slayers with medium and even high combat skills. He can also be found onTutorial Island, where he is theMeleeandRangedcombatteacher.

Chaeldar |  |  | 70Combat,Lost City | ZanarisFairy Queen's court -fairy ringhubChaeldaris infamous for sometimes handing out dangerous tasks.

Konar quo Maten |  |  | 75Combat | Mount Karuulm-fairy ringCIRthen run north.Konar quo Matenis the third hardest Slayer Master. To receiveSlayer tasksfrom her, acombat levelof 75 is required.Unlike other Slayer Masters, herSlayer tasksalso include the location in which she asks you to slay. However, she willnotassign any tasks in theWilderness, asKrystiliaalready does this.Additionally, when on aSlayer taskassigned by Konar, all kills on task have a chance of dropping aBrimstone key, which opens theBrimstone chestbeside Konar. The chance of getting this drop is scaled by the combat level of the NPC players are fighting, and the key is grantedin additionto the primary drop you would receive.

Nieve |  |  | 85Combat | Tree Gnome Stronghold, near themagic treesand the southernbank.Nieve is the second most difficult Slayer Master. Her assignments are the same as Duradel's, except she doesn't assignwaterfiends, butturothsinstead (along with the number of monsters assigned per task).If players have completedMonkey Madness II, she is replaced by her little cousin,Steve.

Duradel |  |  | 100Combat,50 SlayerShilo Village | Shilo Village, top floor of theFishing store-fairy ringCKR,Gnome glider,Karamja gloves 3or theShilo Village cart systemDuradelis the most difficultSlayer Master. His assignments are generally high-levelled monsters, both in combat and Slayer levels. He also assignswaterfiends.If the player has completedWhile Guthix Sleeps, he is replaced with his daughter,Kuradal.

Boss Slayer[edit|edit source]

Players who have unlocked theLike a bossability via spending 200Slayer reward pointscan haveNieve/Steve,Duradel/Kuradal,Konar quo MatenorKrystilia(Wildernessonly) assign thembossmonsters in addition to the tasks they already assign.Slayer Masterswill check the requirements needed to access theboss; for example, if the player doesn't have 85 Slayer, they won't offer them anAbyssal Siretask. They will allow the player to decide the amount of bosses they wish to kill for that task, ranging from 3 to 35 (up to 36 for Barrows) per task. The maximum assignment can be increased by completingCombat Achievementtiers, up to a maximum of 65.

Completing this type of assignment will always grant 5,000 Slayer experience after the task is complete. The following bosses can be assigned:

There are also certain regular tasks that can be completed by killingbosses, these tasks are:

Slayer Partners[edit|edit source]

Slayer Partners were introduced toOld School RuneScapeon7 May 2015, which allows two players to work together on aSlayer assignmentafter inviting your partner to be your Slayer partner by using anenchanted gem,Slayer ring, orSlayer helmeton them. Take into consideration that both you and your partner need to haveno task assignedto be able to partner up correctly, if you try to partner up whilst either one of you has a task it will not work.

There are a few restrictions to prevent players being given tasks that they should not get. You will only be given a Slayer assignment that you have unlocked, have the Slayer andCombat levelto complete and do not have blocked. If these criteria are not met then your partner will receive the task but youwill not. You will be notified if this happens. Note that players that have unlockedTzTok-JadandTzKal-Zukwill not be offered to slay him once instead of the number ofTzHaargiven if they are partnered.

Players can dismiss their Slayer partner at any time by using an enchanted gem, Slayer ring, or Slayer helm to open up the interface.

Ironman Modeplayers are unable to participate as a Slayer partner, unless participating within a Group Ironman team.

Following several incidents of bug abuse, the Slayer partner system was discontinued inan updateon12 June2020. Later on in theApril 2023 Game Jam, a Group Slayer system was developed which could both function in theGroup Ironman Modeas well as replace the original Slayer Partner system. Later, in ablogposton1 August2024, there have been plans made to re-introduce the Slayer partner system, with new restrictions to reduce the possibilities of abuse. Finally on14 August2024, the Slayer partner system was reintroduced with several major changes with receiving and completing a task with a partner.

Receiving a Task[edit|edit source]

The issues regarding exploitation and boost abuse from the previous iteration have been addressed, ensuring that both partners can enjoy the assigned tasks. Several changes have been made to improve the experience:

When a player is tasked with obtaining a Slayer assignment, only their personal block list will be considered.The assigned task will be one that both players in the partnership are able to complete.The previous requirement for one player to possess a higher Slayer level than their partner has been removed.Concerns about certain difficult tasks being blocked were acknowledged, resulting in the minimum limit of total combined tasks by Slayer Partners being adjusted from 10 to 15, based on player feedback.If a player already has a task, they will not be able to partner up until that task is completed. This ensures that the partnered task is suitable for both players. Additionally, Iron players will be unable to form partnerships, though Group Iron players may team up with other members of their group.The game now remembers the partner if either player logs out, allowing the task to be paused or completed solo if desired. However, should one partner claim a new task whilst the other is offline, the partnership will be dissolved.

It is possible to cancel the current task at any time, though both partners must cancel to receive a new one.

Completing a Task[edit|edit source]

Provided that both players remain within 30 tiles of each other and are on the same world, Slayer Kill Count credit will be shared between the partners, facilitating faster task completion.

To prevent abuse, tasks will only be considered complete for both players if each has contributed by killing at least 20% of the required monsters. The exception to this rule is instanced boss Slayer tasks, where only the kills made by one player will count towards the task.

Slayer Points are distributed proportionally based on the percentage of the task completed by each player. For example, if one player kills 60 gargoyles whilst the other kills 40, the 15 Slayer Points would be divided between the two players: 9 for the first player, and 6 for the second. If both players killed 50 gargoyles, each would receive 8 points, as the game rounds up in this case, granting an extra point compared to solo play.

To maintain fairness, Task Streak bonuses are applied separately to each player. For example, if two players killed exactly 50% of the required monsters each for a Krystilia task, and this was the 10th Krystilia task for Player A, they would receive 50% of the base Slayer Points (about 12) and the full 100 point bonus for completing 10 tasks, for a total of 112 points. However, Player B is not completing their 10th task for Krystilia, and as such only receives 50% of the base Slayer Points, but does not receive any of Player A's 100 point bonus, for a total of 12 points.

Upon completing a task and receiving the associated points, partners can choose to continue slaying together with a new task or pursue their activities individually.

Slayer reward points[edit|edit source]

On12 December 2013, Slayer reward points were released. Slayer reward points may be earned after having completed five tasks in a row without having a task changed byTurael. However, players may cancel a task by spending 30 points.Tip: You may want to use anexpeditious braceletto complete the first five tasks faster.

The rewards that can be bought with these points include unlocking new monsters as a Slayer task, aSlayer ring, the ability to combine all Slayer headgear into one item, theSlayer helmet, and even the ability to prevent players from being assigned a specific task forever.

Since getting good tasks worth keeping isn't guaranteed, it is suggested that players get their first four assignments from the Slayer MasterTurael, and then get any other assignments from higher Masters likeDuradel.

After getting five or more tasks in a row, Slayer Masters will hand out points when players finish their tasks. The number of points varies as the difficulty of the Slayer Master increases.

Every 10th, 50th, 100th, 250th, and 1,000th task, a special bonus is given to the player's Slayer reward points, the bonuses also differ in points to each Slayer Master. Whenever a task is done the player will be notified on what number task it is, and the total amount of points they have. This can help players plan to what Slayer Master they prefer to go next, to maximise the number of Slayer reward points in the shortest amount of time.

After earning enough points, players will be able to buy rewards with earned points. (Seemain articlefor more details)

TheSlayer helmetcombines the stat boosting qualities of theBlack maskwith the protective Slayer headgearfacemask,nosepeg,earmuffs,reinforced goggles(should the player have finishedA Porcine of Interest), andSpiny helmet, with the defence bonuses of arune full helm, making it the best melee helmet option for slayers. This allows for monsters likeaberrant spectresanddust devilsto be killed while having the bonuses of the 15% Attack and Strength increase. Players can also imbue their Slayer helmets via theNightmare Zone. This gives all the bonuses of the Slayer helmet, while boosting Ranged and Magic by 15% as well. The Slayer helmet's effectsdo notstack with asalve amuletorsalve amulet (e)for a bonus onundead creatures, such as aberrant spectres. The Slayer helmet has a better bonus so it is recommended just to wear the Slayer helmet and an amulet of your choice (unless you have yet to unlock the ability to create the helmet and use the nose peg for example; then a salve amulet is recommended).

Temporary boosts[edit|edit source]

Players can boost the Slayer skill in order to be able to kill higher-level Slayer monsters. If the player's Slayer skill drops below the threshold to kill a monster while fighting it, the player will stop attacking the monster and will  be told they need higher Slayer in order to attack it. Boosts do not allow players to acquire tasks that require a Slayer level above their base unboosted level.
