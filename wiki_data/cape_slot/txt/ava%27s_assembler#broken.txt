[Weapon: Ava%27S Assembler#Broken]


Ava's assembleris the upgraded version ofAva's accumulatorthat requires level 70Rangedto equip. The assembler gives the second best Ranged attack bonus for thecape slotand is one of the few cape slot items that provides aRanged Strengthbonus. To obtain the assembler, players must take 75mithril arrows,Ava's accumulator(or 4,999 coins), andVorkath's head(which can only be obtained by killingVorkathafter completion ofDragon Slayer II) toAvainDraynor Manor.
Like all ofAva's devices, the assembler does not work when metal torso armour is worn, as this will cause 'interference'; this includes most melee armour as well asAhrim's robetop. A list of metal torso armour that doesnotinterfere with Ava's assembler can be foundhere.
