[Weapon: Fish Sack Barrel#Open]


Thefish sack barrelis made by using afish sackon afish barrel. It is an equipable version of the fish barrel, and has the same functions; players can right-click to open the box to have raw fish that the player picks up or fishes be automatically placed inside the barrel, provided there is space for it.
Rather than a right-click "Check" option that the fish barrel has, the fish sack barrel has a right-click "Configure" option that prompts the player to either check the barrel's contents or to dismantle the item, which splits the item back into a fish sack and fish barrel. This item is lost on death during PvP.
