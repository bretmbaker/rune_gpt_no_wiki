ASlayer capeis theCape of Accomplishmentfor players who have achieved level 99 in theSlayerskill. The cape can be purchased for 99,000coinsfromDuradel(orKuradalafter completion ofWhile Guthix Sleeps), inShilo Village. Slayer capes are black in colour, and have a red trim if the player has more than one level 99 skill. As Duradel is in Shilo Village, players must have completed theShilo Villagequestin order to buy the cape.
Like allskill capes, the Slayer cape gives +9 to all defensive stats, and also a +4 bonus to prayer if it is trimmed, which requires a separate skill at level 99. The cape is automatically trimmed if this condition is met.
