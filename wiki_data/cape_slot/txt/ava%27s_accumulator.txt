[Weapon: Ava%27S Accumulator]


Ava's accumulatoris an item awarded to the player by completing the questAnimal Magnetismif the player is above level 50Ranged(players with lower than 50 Ranged will instead receiveAva's attractor). It is equipped in thecape slot, can pick up a player's ranged ammunition after they fire it, and every 3.5 minutes, will attract an assortment of metal ammunition. The accumulator gives the fourth best Ranged attack bonus for thecape slot.
Like all ofAva's devices, the accumulator will not work when metal torso armour (Ahrim's top included) is worn, as this will cause 'interference'. A list of metal torso armour that doesnotinterfere with Ava's accumulator can be foundhere.
