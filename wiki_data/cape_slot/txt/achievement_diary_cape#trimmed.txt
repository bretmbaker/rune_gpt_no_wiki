It becomes trimmed after completion of all quests, as do thequest point capeandmusic capeafter completing all the diaries. However, if a new quest is released, the cape will automatically untrim itself and cannot be trimmed until the player completes the new quest. UnlikeCapes of Accomplishmentfor skills, the achievement diary cape can be trimmed and untrimmed at will (provided that the player meets the requirements to trim it), and it provides a +4 prayer bonus whether or not it is trimmed. Untrimmed skill capes will not be trimmed from trimming the achievement diary cape.
