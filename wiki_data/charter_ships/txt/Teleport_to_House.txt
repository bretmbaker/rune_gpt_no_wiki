Teleport to House, also known as 'House Teleport', teleports the caster inside theirplayer-owned house, right next to the exit portal (or within the house), regardless of the 'location' of the house (Rimmington,Taverley,Brimhaven, etc.).

When adventuring, a player could bring runes or tablets for this spell to guard againstdyingfrompoisonand fully heal themselves instead. Dying in a player-owned house will cause the player torespawnoutside the house portal,NOTlose any items, and have all stats restored to default levels.

Players can toggle their defaultplayer-owned houseteleport toBuilding Modevia the POHsettingsmenu.
