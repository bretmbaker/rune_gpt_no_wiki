Thehouse portal, commonly referred to as aPOH portal, is the entrance to aplayer-owned house(POH), the main feature of theConstructionskill.House Advertisementsare also found next to these portals, in which players can check whether advertised houses contain frequently used features.

To use the portal, left-click on the portal and then choose one of the four presented options:

Enter your own house (only works if your house is in the same location as the portal)Enter your own house in building mode (only works if your house is in the same location as the portal)Go to another player's house (only works if their house is in the same location as the portal, they are on the same world and they have private chat set so that you can message them)Take no action

Travelling to house portals[edit|edit source]

The most basic way to get to a house is by walking to the portal that is in the location of the house. At level 40Magic, players can use theTeleport to Housespell to teleport directly into the player's own house. Using a houseteleport tabletis another option that only uses oneinventoryspace and does not require a Magic level to use. In the house options screen, players can choose whether the house teleports land the player in the house itself or outside the portal. TheConstruction capeprovides unlimited teleports to the player's own house and to all the house portals regardless of house location.
