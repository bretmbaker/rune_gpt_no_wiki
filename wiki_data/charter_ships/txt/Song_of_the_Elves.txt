By rescuing his daughter Elena from Plague City, the quarantined West Ardougne, you begin to unravel the mystery surrounding the disease. With her help, you discover the plague is a hoax - a plot by King Lathas to section off the West Ardougne. By confronting him, you find out this was done to protect the rest of Gielinor from the threat in the elven lands.The king sends you on a mission to travel through the Underground Pass and help his ally, Lord Iorwerth, in eradicating his brother King Tyras who threatens to revive the mysterious Dark Lord. After an arduous journey through the pass, you meet with Iorwerth and his forces to end Tyras' evil once and for all.Upon your return to Lathas you are intercepted by Arianwyn, a rebel elf who opposes Lord Iorwerth. He informs you of Lathas and Iorwerth's deception. They manipulated you into removing their final opposition and were now free to bring the Dark Lord back to Gielinor for their own intentions. You work with the elven rebellion to discover the purpose of the plague was to disguise the digsite of the long lost Temple of Light. An ancient place that is key to bringing back the Dark Lord.To make amends for your past mistakes and put a halt in King Lathas' and Lord Iorwerth's plans, you solve the intricate light puzzle designed to protect the Death Altar within the temple.

Leaguenotes | UnlockingTirannwn✓will auto-complete the quest

The escape of Elena[edit|edit source]

To begin the quest talk toEdmond, who can be found in the garden at his home inEast Ardougnenorth of theFlying Horse Inn. (You can pick up a cabbage and spade in Edmond's garden if needed). He will tell you thatElenahas been going around telling people that the plague isn't real, and has been taken by the Knights of Ardougne who claimed she was inciting rebellion against the king. Agree to help, and seek outKing Lathasupstairs in his castle just south.

Speak to King Lathas while not wearing Mourner gear. He will tell you that Elena was imprisoned due to spreading news that the plague is fake and as he has explained before, the façade is a necessary evil and he simply can't risk Elena exposing the truth and risking everything, including the looming threat that is theDark Lord, and thus must keep her imprisoned.

Return to Edmond. The player tells him about everything they've done since the events of thePlague Cityquest, summing up the entire questline. He will then tell you that Elena is imprisoned in the city prison beneath the castle, and asks you to go undercover as aKnight of Ardougneand find a way to free her.

You will need asteel full helm,steel platebody,steel platelegs,red dye,purple dyeand one piece ofsilk. Use the red dye on the steel full helm to obtain anArdougne knight helm, and then talk to his wife,Alrena. You will receive atabardfrom her; use it on the steel platebody to obtain anArdougne knight platebody. Equip your helm, platebody and steel platelegs. Pures who do not have 5 Defence and are unable to equipsteel platelegsmust talk to Edmond to polish the steel platelegs intoArdougne knight platelegs.

Talk to Edmond again. He will tell you to go to the prison, which is located beneath the castle.

Go to the basement of theArdougne Castle. Here, a guard will stop you. You will tell him your name is Tim, Sue, or Sam, and be allowed to continue. Talk toElenain the prison; she will tell you she wants to escape through a grate into theArdougne Sewers, and needs you to fetch her somesulphuric acidtodissolvethe grate, which you can find in acabinetin her home. Go to her house, which is found east of Edmond's house directly next to the log balance. Search the cabinet and select thethick clear liquid, and you'll receive a vial ofclear liquid.

After you bring the sulphuric acid to Elena, go back and talk to Edmond while she escapes. He will tell you she already came by and is hiding to avoid being recaptured, but tells you that she is hiding in theRehnison householdinWest Ardougne. The Rehnisons' house is located directly west of theMourner's Headquarters. Talk toTed Rehnison, or his wifeMartha, who will tell you the resistance is waiting in the basement below. Search the eastern bed and climb down.

Elena will tell you about the Ardougne Resistance, which she founded after discovering the plague is a hoax in order to overthrow King Lathas, and you will tell her about what you've been up to while infiltrating the mourners.Councillor Halgrivewill then speak to you. He will tell you that although the council serves the king and can't overrule his decisions, they can step in as interim ruler should the king be deemed unfit to rule. Councillor Halgrive tells you of his plan to have you (disguised as a Knight of Ardougne) upset the people of Ardougne in order to make it appear as if you're doing so under the king's orders.

Causing an insurrection[edit|edit source]

You will need to go aroundWestandEast Ardougnedoing certain actions to rile up the population. Each action will convert members to the Ardougne Resistance. Keep in mind you do not have to talk to every person on this list; you just need to convert a total of 80 members.

InWest Ardougne, dress up as amournerand do the following to make the population angry:

InEast Ardougne, dress up as anArdougne Knightand do the following:

After you have recruited 80 new members, bank to prepare yourself for the first fight of the quest.

| This fight takes place in aninstance.Ondeath, all unprotected items will be moved to agraveoutside the instance. Any items left on the ground will be lost.

Once ready for the fight, return to theRehnison Householdin West Ardougne. Enter the basement under the bed and talk toElenato begin the battle of West Ardougne.

The fight has three parts. Each part has a kill counter in the chatbox and resistance fighters will help you in combat.Protect from Meleewill protect you from all damage, but high-levelled players will find that decent armour will protect them from most damage. Alternatively,Guthan the Infested's equipmentcan be used, needing nofoodorprayerto complete. Mages can also use the cornering trick to stack the mobs and burst or barrage them for faster kills. Furthermore, despite some of the mourners wielding crystal halberds, they have an attack range of 1, so they can be safely trapped on corners and safespotted.

In the first part, you have to kill 10Mourners:

Level 24 (3)Level 51 (5)Level 106 (2)

In the second part, head downstairs via the trapdoor and kill 11 Mourners:

Level 24 (3)Level 51 (4)Level 106 (4)

Note: if you leave the battle having reached the second part, when you return you will be downstairs and not have to kill the initial 10 Mourners.

After the second part, the fight pauses and you can bank and resupply if necessary. Talk to Elena orCouncillor Halgriveto commence the battle of East Ardougne. Some of the NPCs are on the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US].

Knight of Ardougne(level 27) (5)Paladin(level 49) (6)Knight of Ardougne (level 53) (2)Paladin (level 121) (2)

After you've killed all the guards ofKing Lathas, you will see a cut-scene, where the resistance fighters bring King Lathas out, who they find hidden in a wardrobe. Players can speak to the king and ask him the reasons for his actions over the course of the quest series. In the end, he is sentenced to death by the citizens of Ardougne. After the execution,Hooded Figureswill knock you out and take you to theIorwerth Camp.

The resistance fight the knights and paladins of East Ardougne.Lathas is captured by the resistance.Lathas is sentenced to death.

Arianwyn's plan[edit|edit source]

A long cutscene will play, where you andElenaare brought beforeLord Iorwerth. Before you both are about to be taken prisoner,Arianwynand the elf resistance will appear to rescue you. Lord Iorwerth will reveal that he lied toKing Lathasin order to accessWest Ardougneand reach theTemple of Lightto summonSeren. Arianwyn refutes this, believing Seren to be dead; Lord Iorwerth thought the same, until he managed to break one of the seals in theGrand Library, where he discovered a part of Seren remains trapped within the Temple. He will let the rebels go, believing they could be of use in their plans while they are none the wiser.

Returning toLletya, Arianwyn calls a meeting, and asks you to notifyYsgawynand Elena. You must talk to Ysgawyn first before Elena will appear. Ysgawyn can be found on the upper platform of Lletya; speak to him first. After you have done this Elena can be found in the south-west corner by the pond. After talking to Elena, return to Arianwyn and talk to him to begin the meeting.

The meeting will tell of the history of the elves from the end of theGod Warsto the ongoing civil war, where the city ofPrifddinaswas reverted to a crystal seed, and the Grand Library along with it, which Lord Iorwerth claimed he accessed. It is decided that the player and Arianwyn will investigate theWaterfall Dungeonto see whetherKing Baxtorianleft anything behind that would explain more about the fragment of Seren.

Be sure to speak to Arianwyn after the meeting, or he will not appear atBaxtorian Falls.

Visiting Baxtorian Falls[edit|edit source]

Travel to theWaterfall Dungeon(requires arope). Go to the eastern room with theskeletonsandskeleton magesand search the northern stacked crate fora key, and then go to the western room withfire giantsand past the two single doors. Talk toArianwyn, and he will hand you a book,Ode to eternity, with a riddle, that requires you to use items on the pillars around the tomb.

Warning:If you place the items on the incorrect pillars, you will have to buy/collect the items again, and each time you enter the room, the order of numbers will change! If you leave the room before finishing the puzzle, you may be able to continue it or replace the item on the pillar you did incorrectly.

Each of the six items has a number as follows:

Nature runeFlowersfrommithril seedsoradamant seeds, or anirit leafBlack knifeorblack daggerWine of ZamorakorZamorak brew(4)Adamant chainbodyCabbage

The layout is random, and you will need to inspect the pillars to figure out the order.Make sure to read the book before placing any items.

The south-west pillar will say which number it is. Place the item corresponding to this number on the south-west pillar.The west pillar will say it is not opposite of a number. Place the item corresponding to this number on the south-east pillar.The north-west pillar will say the number it is next to. This number corresponds to the item to place on the west pillar.The north-east pillar will say the number it is opposite to. This number corresponds to the item to place on the north-west pillar.The east pillar will say what number it is not next to. This number corresponds to the item to place on the east pillar.The south-east pillar will say what numberisn'tgoing on the pillar. This number corresponds to the item to place on the north-east pillar.

After placing all of the items in the right locations, the statue of Baxtorian will spring to life, asBaxtorianhimself. Arianwyn will teleport Baxtorian back toLletya. Bank to gather items for the next section and then teleport back to Lletya yourself.

Preparing to enter Prifddinas[edit|edit source]

Back inLletya, talk toBaxtorianandArianwyn. Baxtorian says there may be a way to enter theGrand LibraryofPrifddinas, to learn more about whatLord Iorwerthwas planning, via the use of a specially made potion and bypassing the city walls, which have been enchanted so that only Iorwerth elves and their allies can enter; Baxtorian believesLord Amlodd, an expert in magic, would be able to break the spell.

You will be asked to create the potion. Talk toElenanext to the pond, and plant acadantine seedin the nearby farming patch, which is specially treated to yieldelder cadantine. Elena will ask you to check if Arianwyn and Baxtorian have anything for you to do while you wait for the seed to grow.

Since much of the rest of the quest takes place in the elven lands with their many traps, it is recommended to have an anti-poison potion available, since tripwires if failed will poison the player.

Talk toBaxtorianand ask how to findLord AmloddandLady Trahaearn. Ask how to find both elves before proceeding to save yourself time; the order in which the two are found does not matter.Lady Trahaearngave the clue "I will journey south from the well" toBaxtorianbefore she left.Lord AmloddgaveBaxtoriana specialcrystal seedfor safekeeping, which he gives to you.

Talk toEluned(found in south-westLletya, north of the patch where you planted thecadantine) to ask her to enchant the crystal seed before proceeding with the quest.

Note: If you choose to search for Lady Trahaearn before Lord Amlodd, you will not need to bring a teleport crystal with you, since Lord Amlodd will automatically teleport you back to Lletya after speaking to him.

Finding Lady Trahaearn[edit|edit source]

Travel west ofLletyaand pass through the trees north of thedire wolves. Then run across the clearing, step over the tripwire, and head west through the 3 dense forests. Travel north through the leaf trap, and finally east to reach the cave entrance to theUnderground Pass. Inside, walk south of theWell of Voyageto inspect the blocked crevice. Afterwards, use yourpickaxeon the blocked crevice to clear it and go inside. Upon entering, you'll find an Elderly Elf wearing a damaged exoskeleton. Use arunite barandhammeron her to fix the exoskeleton. She will then be revealed to be Lady Trahaearn, and will teleport back to Lletya.

Now, you should rub the crystal seed you received from Baxtorian and had enchanted by Eluned to find Lord Amlodd. However, if you chose to look for Lord Amlodd first, then return to Lletya, either on foot or with ateleport crystal(if you brought one), to make the potion.

Finding Lord Amlodd[edit|edit source]

After rubbing the crystal seed (make sure you had it enchanted first), you will be teleported to theEnchanted Valleywhere you find aMysterious Figure, who will ask for your opinion on the state of the valley. Choose any of the available options and the Mysterious Figure will reveal that he is Lord Amlodd. He will then teleport you back to Lletya.

Making the potion[edit|edit source]

Once Lord Amlodd and Lady Trahaearn have been found, talk toElenaagain and get theelder cadantine. Talk toArianwynto get theold crystal, and use it with apestle and mortarto makecrystal dust. Use the elder cadantine on avial of water, and then use the crystal dust with the unfinished potion to make theinversion potion.

Talk to Arianwyn and give him the potion, and a meeting will begin in which it is decided who enters the Grand Library.Ysgawynwill disagree, while everyone else believes you are up to the task. Talk toLord Amlodd(located north from Arianwyn) once more to teleport to theGrand Library.

The Grand Library of Prifddinas[edit|edit source]

(Before you enter the library, take note that any unlocked memories can teleport you to other unlocked seal locations if you ask it where else you can be teleported to. You must have already heard the memory in order to teleport to it, simply solving the light puzzle doesn't enable the teleport. This can help with saving some run energy as you travel around the library.)

Talk toLord Ieuan Amloddto be transported into theGrand Library. If you log out inside, you will be kicked out but your progress will be saved.

As this seal was already unlocked byLord Iorwerth, one must simply walk to the Seal of the Forgotten in the centre and click on it. Walk to the seal indicated on the map to the right, and then touch the Seal of the Forgotten.

Amemory of Serenwill then reveal that her dark guilt is sealed away in theTemple of Light, but that an orb of light at the shrine atGorlahexists to unlock this dark part of her.

TheMemory of Serenwill reveal that when she first encountered the elves on their homeworld ofTarddiad, the mystic elfCeidwaddocumentedSeren's teachings in a book called theCerddi.

TheMemory of Serenwill reveal that while elves lived relatively long, they did not live long enough, and soSerenwatched her friends die, which was a painful process for her.

TheMemory of Serenwill reveal thatSerenshared a piece of her essence with the elves, lengthening their lifespans to thousands of years. This gift was given in the form of a song, called the song of creation.

TheMemory of Serenwill reveal that although the elves had increased longevity, they ended up being bound to her. If the elves strayed too far fromSeren, they would suffer pain and even death.

TheMemory of Serenwill reveal that she met a divine being that spoke of a different perfect world filled with power. AsSerenwanted to save the elves, she sought this power. The elves had to accompany her or else they would die. She convinced the elves to go on this mission.

TheMemory of Serenwill reveal that in this new world, they made a crystal city, but the curse remained.

TheMemory of Serenwill reveal that millennia later,Serenfound a source ofdeathly energydeep within the mountains.

TheMemory of Serenreveals that she created a dark fragment of herself to try and counter the curse. Unfortunately, it did not work and the dark fragment tried to killSeren. Seren locked the dark fragment away in theTemple of Light.

Finding Lord Crwys and Lady Hefin[edit|edit source]

Return toArianwyninLletya, who will call everyone to a meeting to hear your discoveries in theGrand Library. Everyone will be shocked by the revelations, except forYsgawyn, who accuses you of lying and demands you to be taken away in chains. However,Baxtorianbelieves you and lets you continue reporting your discoveries. With Arianwyn still in shock, he will ask Baxtorian to temporarily lead. Ysgawyn will search for theorb of lightonGorlah. In the meanwhile, you will be told to search forLord CrwysandLady Hefin. As before, ask Baxtorian for the clue on how to find each of them.

Finding Lady Hefin[edit|edit source]

Lady Hefin gave Baxtorian the clue "I will walk across the water to the south" before her departure. Leave the village through the trees west, and then run south past where themagic treesare located; continue further south and jump across a trail of stepping stones over the tar lake until you reach a small island with an NPC and tent. Talk to theElf Hermit, who is actually Lady Hefin. After a short conversation, Lady Hefin teleports away.

Finding Lord Crwys[edit|edit source]

Lord Crwys gave Baxtorian the clue "The trees of my home will call to me" before his departure. He will be found south of theIorwerth Camp(refer to image above), on the western side ofIsafdar. Make your way to the Elf Camp - using anIorwerth camp teleportscroll is recommended. Note that the Iorwerth elves will attack you on sight. Cross the log balance and head southwest. You will pass a stick trap to enter the clearing, and then chop the dead tree north-west of the lake (or west of the trap) to free him.Note:You will not be able to cut the tree if you do not ask Baxtorian where to find him.

Now, return back to Lletya and speak to Baxtorian, and after a short cut scene and dialogue, the other NPC's will leave.Note:You will not be able to enter the cave in the next part if you do not talk to Baxtorian.

Recovering the orb[edit|edit source]

| This fight takes place in aninstance.Ondeath, all unprotected items will be moved to agraveoutside the instance. Any items left on the ground will be lost.

Head to theIorwerth Camp. Be wary of the elves at the camp, as they'll attack you on sight, and enter the cave at the north end of the camp. Once inside, after a short dialogue, kill theIorwerth WarriorandArcher. If possible, trap the warrior behind the archer; if that is not possible, then useProtect from Meleeand kill the warrior first before focusing on the ranger.

After killing the elves, claim theorb of lightfrom thechestand return back toLletya; then, speak withBaxtorian.

Tracking down Ysgawyn[edit|edit source]

Note:It is recommended to charge yourteleport crystalsnow if you're running low, since the area becomesinstancedlater on and you cannot do this until much later.

Baxtorianasks you in private to findYsgawyn, who has been acting suspiciously. He tells youElena, who is by the pond and patch where you planted thecadantine seedearlier, was the last person who saw him, and advises you to speak to her. During the conversation, select the second option, and she will tell you that she doesn't know where he went, but tells you that might be possible to search for tracks by the entrance toLletya. It's strongly recommended to bring some food and Anti-poison for the next part as you will be avoiding the traps through the forest.

Head west out the village entrance, through the "pass tree" and inspect themossy rockormushroom(be careful of level-88dire wolves). This will start the tracking sequence, similar to huntingkebbits.

Continue following the tracks and inspect the rocks just before the trip wire for the second set of tracks.Hop over the trip wire and inspect the southern inspect rock option for the third set of tracks leading across the leaves trap.Head south and inspect theelven lampfor the fourth set of tracks.Follow the tracks south-west and inspect the mushrooms north of the large rock.Follow the path and inspect the small rock north-east of where the tracks end for the fifth final set of tracks leading over the trip wire, where you will see Iestin and Ysgawyn.Click on either NPC to continue the dialogue. (Note:If you do not have an inventory of very good food, such assharksor higher, return back to abank, as you will need it, and someprayer potionsif low level.)

You will witness a conversation with Ysgawyn, and accuse him of being a traitor. However, he will angrily tell you that he is speaking to his informant within theIorwerth clan,Iestin Edern, who provided Ysgawyn with the information about theorb of light, among other things. This was kept a secret from the other elves by Iestin's request, who feared that the other rebels may not be trusting of him; you will have two options to select before continuing the dialogue, before you are teleported into a cutscene, which will continue below.

Iestin will then inform both of you that earlier in the day,Lord Iorwerthhas discovered Lletya via a traitor among the rebel elves, and told him how to find the village, and thatEssylltis preparing their forces as they speak.

The attack on Lletya[edit|edit source]

| This fight takes place in aninstancewith adeathbank.Ondeath, you can payRebel Scout80,000to retrieve lost items.Any unsafe death will delete all items left inside the deathbank.Any items left on the ground will be lost.

Lord Iorwerthhas invaded the town ofLletyaand is wreaking havoc. After a brief cutscene withYsgawyn,IestinandElena, you are tasked with saving two children from one of the burning buildings. Head south into the building and search the various objects on theground floor[UK]1stfloor[US]and1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US](locations vary from player to player) to find the two missing children (tables, sacks, benches, cooking pots etc.). The large flames will restrict locations you are not supposed to go through.Note:There is an escape barricade located west of the instance if you wish to restock food, as you will not be able to do this before the boss fight with Level-212 Arianwyn.

After saving the kids, a cut-scene will follow where Lord Iorwerth reveals that Arianwyn was the traitor, who turned once he discovered they truly wish to returnSeren, and forcesBaxtorianto hand over theOrb of Lightin order to save one of the children. Enraged, Ysgawyn attacks Essyllt, who kills him instantly. After a short dialogue and cut-scene, you will now have to fightArianwynin order to go after the orb once again.

The moment you enter theinstance, useProtect from Missilesprayer. Hit-and-run tactics work best with attacking Arianwyn withmelee gear. Observe the colour of his arrows. His arrows consistently hit in the 30s.

Arianwyn cycles throughthreeranged attacks:

Agreen arrowis a regular attack which can be negated with Protect from Missiles.Theorange arrowis a high damage explosive attack, but it is slow moving and can be avoided by moving one step away.Thepurple arrowdisables active prayers.

After the battle, you will watch another cut-scene in which the surviving elves hold a funeral for Ysgawyn, and decide on what to do next.Islwynwill then ask Baxtorian about what Lord Iorwerth tried telling the rebel elves, and reveals the truth - when Baxtorian discovered where his wife was, he sent what little remained of his army to rescue her, knowing it was a trap but sending them to their deaths anyway due to his desperation to see his wife once more. Enraged, Islwyn leaves for theUnderground Pass, intending to fight theIorwerthon his own.

During the conversation, Baxtorian will reveal the two clues when you select the options for the last two elders -Lady IthellandLady Meilyr- and gives you aclue scroll; head to the bank to restock on the items required for the next part.

Finding Lady Ithell and Lady Meilyr[edit|edit source]

Lady Ithell[edit|edit source]

Ask how to findLady Ithell. She gave the clue "I'll put my soul into my greatest work" before her death. You must walk aroundLletyaand locate thefivesymbolson the walls of the buildings. The symbols are white and glowing, and easy to spot. They are located both upstairs and downstairs:

Thefirstsymbol is up the northern ladder directly above where the group meetings have been taking place. Enter the room with theprayer altar. The symbol is on the wall as you enter the room on the left of the doorway.Leaving that symbol, head north around the upper level to the ladder in the room (upper level of the general store). Thesecondsymbol is on the northern wall between two chairs.Head down the ladder behind you into thegeneral store. Thethirdsymbol is on the wall to the eastern side of the shop, south of the table and south-west of the exit.Leave the general store and head south through the ruined town to the archery shop. Thefourthsymbol is on the wall in the corner north of the table.The finalfifthsymbol is inside the bank in the east tucked away just to the right behind the bank deposit box.

Once all the symbols have been touched, you will gain some of Lady Ithell's knowledge, and you must build astatueon thestatue spacein the centre of the village (next to the water icon on the map) with asaw,hammerand eightlimestone bricks(Flamtaer bag does not work). Upon building the statue and a short dialogue,Kelynwill gaze at the statue and gain all of Lady Ithell's knowledge, now becoming Lady Kelyn Ithell, before teleporting away. Return back toBaxtorianand ask for clues to Lady Meilyr in order to continue with the quest (if not already done).

Lady Meilyr[edit|edit source]

Make sure you have enough inventory space to unequip all of your equipment before continuing. Ask how to findLady Meilyr. She gave the clue "Follow the scrolls to find me" before her departure.Baxtorianwill hand the player aclue scrollwith a coordinate clue. It points to a location south-east of theTyras Camp, near ayew tree; the quickest way is to teleport toCatherbyand use thetrader crewmemberon the pier to head to theTyras CampPort for 800–3,200 coins (depending onRing of charosandCabin Fever). Once there, head through the camp and head north through the dense forest, then east and south through the next set of dense forest south of the grizzly bear/cub, and hop over either trip wire trap and south to the dig spot (4 tiles south of the triple mushroom cluster).

Note: if you have never done treasure trails before, you may fail to dig up the next clue scroll even if you are standing on the correct spot. If this happens try asking theObservatory professorabout treasure trails to obtain asextant,watchandchart. Destroy the Clue scroll that you have, get a new one fromBaxtorianand try again.

The next clue step requires travelling toZul-Andra. A Zul-Andra teleport will take you right there; another quick way to get there is using thefairy ringBJS, although you will need 76Agilityto use the stepping stone shortcut (can be boosted withsummer pies). Otherwise, you may move onward toPort Tyras, go through the camp and head south from the docks, or use atrader crewmemberto charter a ship to theTyras CampPort for 800–3,200 coins (depending onRing of charosandCabin Fever) and head south from there. Once there, venture to the south-east. On the east side of the northernmost hut, dig two steps north of the inconspicuous hole, or theSTASHunit if players have built it, for the third clue scroll.

The third step is: "DEAD ROASTING UPSHIFTS", which is an anagram for "PRIFDDINAS SOUTH GATES". To progress, dig next to the southern city gate ofPrifddinas; players can quickly reach it via anIorwerth camp teleportthen going east through dense forests then north towards the southern gate. Dig one square north of the north-eastern elven lamp for the last clue scroll.

The final step requires you to spin outside the entrance to theUnderground Passin easternIsafdarwith nothing equipped. Head south across the bridge and follow the route, after which, you head north across the northern leaves trap and then further east towards the cave entrance. Once players spin, Lady Ffion Meilyr will appear for a short dialogue before departing. Use yourteleport crystalto head to Lletya to bank/restock.

Sealing the Underground Pass[edit|edit source]

Head for the dwarven camp in the Underground Pass. It can be reached easily by takingThe Abyssto the Death Altar, exiting the altar and taking the tunnel on the western wall outside the altar (although your prayer points will be drained) or walking fromLletya. Take care that if you die fightingEssylltyou cannot re-enter from the Death Altar. You will be stopped by the game informing you that your items are being held by an allied elf. To traverse from the elven village, head north to theUnderground Pass. Pass through the well, and make your way to the bottom level. You can reach the bottom level by either failing a bridge jump or reaching the 'Descend Cave' location south on the perimeter.

You will reach the dwarven camp. Speak withBaxtorian(middle), thenElena(east). She will give you sevenexplosive potions(they're stackable, so you will only need one free inventory space for these). Place them inside theholesnorth/outside of the camp's perimeter; then, speak to Baxtorian once again. He will tell you thatLord Iorwerthwishes to meet with him, and asks that you join him. The meeting will result inArianwyndisagreeing with Lord Iorwerth's plan to freeSerenregardless if she becomes evil or not, but choosing to remain with him anyway. The attack will then begin when you select 'I'm ready' option.

Defend the camp for four minutes from several Elf Archers and Warriors, who will also try to destroy the gate defences. Failing will reset the attempt. The elf warriors will infinitely re-spawn. Even while under attack, enemies will not remain aggressive towards you, so you will have to keep attacking different enemies and draw their attention away from the barrier. It doesn't matter if any of them are killed, but the barricade has to hold forfour (4) minutesinmulti-combat.

Since it isn't needed to actually hit the enemies to change their attention away from the barrier to the player, any weapon will do. Newly spawned enemies always attack the barrier first, so it may be useful to use a low-damage weapon. Fast-hitting weapons also are preferable, for exampledarts,knivesor thegoblin paint cannon.

After keeping the barrier intact, the elven warriors come storming through the defences anyway and Elena is injured byEssyllt, whom you must kill. Should you die, or leave the battle, you will not have to defend the barrier again.

Essyllt is level 236 and primarily attacks withmelee. He also has two special attacks that he can use at random:

Essyllt may shove you backwards with his spear, stunning you briefly, and then launch arangedattack that can deal significant damage; this can be completely blocked by switching toProtect from Missiles.Essyllt throws a potion at you that drains all your combat stats by 5. This attack cannot be negated withprotection prayers, but the stat drain can be offset by drinking a dose ofSuper restore. You can also ignore the stat drain if you have high enough combat stats, since the drains don't stack past 5, so your stats will only be drained to max-5.

Note: After the battle with Essyllt, if your prayer runs out during the following cutscene you will be removed from the cutscene and placed outside of the battle. You can go down the tunnel to the bottom level of the Underground Pass to immediately resume the cutscene.

After you defeat him, Lord Iorwerth manages to pass through the crevice into theTemple of Light; Arianwyn and Baxtorian follow after him. After you check that Elena is alright, you follow as well. Lord Iorwerth will then free theFragment of Seren, despite Arianwyn's protests. Arianwyn filled with newfound doubt and skepticism shoots Lord Iorwerth wounding him. The Fragment will then drag the player to her realm, believing the player is a servant of Seren sent to dispose of her once and for all.

The elves find the Fragment of Seren, sealed.Lord Iorwerth frees theFragment of Seren.The Fragment of Seren, enraged.

Facing the Dark Lord[edit|edit source]

| This fight takes place in aninstancewith adeathbank.Ondeath, you can payRebel Scout80,000to retrieve lost items.Any unsafe death will delete all items left inside the deathbank.Any items left on the ground will be lost.

Note:It may be wise to use your emergencyteleporthere and bank before attempting this fight.

The final part of the quest is to defeat theFragment of Seren.

She is weak tomagicattacks. No forms of recoil work. Thralls cannot be summoned.

Her basic attacks arerangedandmelee. If the player stands next to her, she uses melee, if they stand away from her, she uses ranged. Prayers reduce the damage she causes, but do not fully block it. Players should useProtect from Missilesand not stand next to her as her melee attacks are much more rapid and can deal loads of damage in very little time compared to ranged.

During the encounter she will cycle between multiple special attacks in this order. Each special attack is separated by about 15 seconds (usually enough time for her to do 3 normal attacks). She always announces a special attack by saying some text. Note that there isno limitto the number of times she can cycle through her special attacks in any given phase.

The first special attack teleports the player next to her. This will then be followed by a melee attack, so walk away quickly to avoid damage.The second special attack consists of spawning of multiple copies of her, attacking the correct one (the lighter coloured shadow) will despawn the false ones and cause the Fragment of Seren to reappear.The third special attack consists of multiple beams of red crystals, which will surround the Fragment of Seren and heal her until they are destroyed (4-8 per heal per beam). Any attack will destroy them, so using a fast attack speed weapon such asdartsortoxic blowpipewill deal with them quickly, but overall they do not heal much damage so slower weapons will work as well.Chinchompasare an effective option as the medium-fuse combat style has a 3 tick attack speed, and an attack range of 9 tiles, which prevents the player from accidently running into Seren's melee range when attacking the beams. The beams despawn before the Fragment initiates the final special attack. UsingBlood spellson the beams will heal around 5-6 health per attack, despite them having only 1 health.The final special attack is the most dangerous; she will teleport the player close to her and charge up an unblockable attack that's based on the player's hitpoints, dealing all the way up to the player'smaximum hitpoints minus 1, regardless of current hp. After clearing her third special, players should eat up close to their max hp, and then once she teleports the player eat to or above their max hp in order to survive this attack.

After the fourth attack, the cycle will continue with the first attack again.

As the fight progresses the Fragment's special attacks will increase in power. Only the first attack is unaffected by this.

1st phase (between 1,000 and 666 hitpoints)

The second special attack creates 1 right and 1 false clone.The third special attack summons 2 healing beams.The final special attack dealsmax hitpoints - 5.

2nd phase (between 666 and 333 hitpoints)

The second special attack creates 1 right and 2 false clones.The third special attack summons 3 healing beams.The final special attack dealsmax hitpoints - 3.

3rd phase (between 333 and 1 hitpoints)

The second special attack creates 1 right and 3 false clones.The third special attack summons 4 healing beams.The final special attack dealsmax hitpoints - 1.

Recommended strategy[edit|edit source]

Mage robes (i.e.Mystics,Ahrim's set,ancestral robes,void knight equipment)Trident of the swamp(at least 300 charges) or a weapon that can autocastAncient Magicks(i.e.ancient staff,master wandetc.) if usingblood spells.Note:All damage towards her is capped at 24.Ranged weapon with a quick attack (Darts,Toxic blowpipe, orMagic shortbow) for pillars only. This stops additional healing. Preferably useChinchompason theMedium Fuseattack style, as this method will keep you out of the Fragment's melee range while maintaining the same attack speed as darts or throwing knives on accurate/long range.Items with magic bonus (i.e.seers ring,occult necklace,imbued god capes,barrows gloves,book of darkness,tome of fireetc.)Depending on your levels and strategy, it may be necessary to also incorporate some prayer bonus. Consider bringing e.g.amulet of fury,book of darkness,Dagon'hai robes,Elite Void Knight equipmentor thering of the gods (i).If anelysian spirit shieldis accessible, it can reduce the amount of damage you take during the one shot special attack.

Depending on strategy, a player may wish to bring a weapon switch (e.g.Toxic Blowpipe), an emergency teleport, arune pouchand/or stacks ofrunes.
The rest of the inventory should be filled withSuper restoresandSaradomin brewsin a ratio of 1:3.

Drink a dose ofSaradomin brewandsuper restorebefore entering the boss fight.Once in the boss fight, activateProtect from MissilesandMystic MightorAugury(for extra magic attack). If your prayer bonus and level are high, you may also useRapid Healand perhapssteel skintoo.Prioritise dealing damage, UNTIL the Fragment summons the pillars. Once you have destroyed all the pillars (or they despawn), immediately drink Saradomin brew until your health is at or above yourHitpointslevel. (If using ranged + blood spells, one good tactic is to sip brew doses inbetween your attacks on the different healers, since a potion does not slow your attacks down, and the decreased stats do not affect your abilities; see 6.).The Fragment of Seren will now launch a projectile at you that deals up to max health minus 1.This projectile cannot be avoided.Once the damage is dealt, drink Saradomin brews until your health is at a reasonable level, then drink two doses of your super restore potion. This makes sure yourMagiclevel stays high, so your magic attacks have a higher level of success.If you rely on blood spells remember that drinkingSaradomin brewmay disable your ability to cast them and your autocast is cancelled when you attack, which can lead to dangerous situations. It may be a good idea to set the autocast to a lower spell such asBlood Rushand rely mostly on manual casting, or to ensure that your magic level is sufficiently high before resuming attacks on the Fragment. (Properly drinking three successive brew sips followed by one super restore dose, with auto-retaliate off, will (almost always) keep your high-level spell selected on the autocast menu). (Keep auto-retaliate OFF during the fight if you are using brews. Wandering into melee range when your autocast gets deselected due to brews can result in large melee damage).

Repeat steps 3-5; however, be wary you may need to drink Saradomin brew/super restore potion during other phases of the fight.

Another good way to beat the Fragment is to useBlood spellsto keep your Hitpoints up. Using this method requires less Saradomin brews, and is easier for people who struggle with the brew/restore ratio. Remember that it may not be necessary to heal to your max Hitpointsafterthe unavoidable special attack, as blood spells can heal the remainder.

If you die during this part, you can pay 80,000 coins to collect your items from therebel scoutat the southern wall on the upper floor of theUnderground Pass. Do not click the crevice and re-enter the Fragment's lair until you have collected all your items from the rebel scout. If you die before collecting your items,all your items will be permanently lost.

Toreturnto the rebel scout and retrieve your items, you can either:

Teleport using theteleport crystaltoLletyaand walk back through theUnderground Pass.Bring acrystal trinketand use aSlayer ringteleport todark beasts. Enter theTemple of Light; head up the stairs in front of you, on the next floor climb the Stairs to the south-west. Next, climb down the two sets of stairs to the north. After climbing down and passing through the light door, there should be atunnel, "Enter Tunnel" on the northern wall. This entrance can only be accessed after you've encountered the boss.Note:If you need to retrieve your things from therebel scout, you must return to the final room with the altar and crawl through the tunnel. It will then return you to the Underground Pass directly next to the rebel scout.Go through theAbyssto theDeath Altar, exit the altar and go through the tunnel in the same room.Warning:Highly discouraged, because one death to PK'ers will mean losing all your stored items. Also watch out as your prayer will be drained to 0 upon entering the Abyss.

Eatingbelladonnaorcave nightshade, drinking a dose ofZamorak brew, or dropping a vial ofnitroglycerinto activate aphoenix necklaceright before the Fragment attacks with her final special attack will nullify all of her damage for a few ticks. To trigger the phoenix necklace you have to use food; while frozen by the Fragment of Seren you can't lower your hp using adwarven rock cake, orLocator orbfrom Dragon Slayer II for example. Blood spells may heal too much for the phoenix necklace to activate.

More information on this strategy can be foundhere.

Before the special attack, make sure your hitpoints are at maximum (or higher) and activate theRedemptionprayer. Drink super restores immediately and re-activateProtect from Missilesand start casting blood spells. Do not attempt this unless you are confident with the technique ofPrayer flicking.

Prifddinas restored[edit|edit source]

After the fight, a short cutscene will be shown whereLord Iorwerthis horrified with the Fragment's defeat. He states that even though it was angry, hurt and confused, it was also innocent. The wounds Iorwerth sustained prove to be fatal, but he states that he hopes they're happy for what they've done to Seren before dying.

Following the defeat of Lord Iorwerth and the Dark Lord, the player is brought to the gates ofPrifddinas.
Outside the newly regrown crystal city,Arianwynwill meet with the player. The player thanks Arianwyn for stopping Iorwerth, but Arianwyn claims that he had to, and decides to leave the elven lands for good. Ridden with guilt for causing the destruction ofLletya, he decides to travel the world to reflect his own actions, and hopefully redeem himself in the process. He bids farewell to the player as they make their way to the gates, whereBaxtorianwelcomes them andElenaas the first humans to visit the elven city.

The Fragment of Seren, defeated.Arianwyn, ridden with guilt, leaves.The gates of Prifddinas are opened.
