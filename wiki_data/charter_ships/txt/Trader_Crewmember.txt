Trader Crewmembersare employees ofTrader Stan, who runs thecharter shipsystem that operates all overGielinor. At each port, there are two crewmembers, with the exception ofPort SarimandCorsair Cove, where Trader Stan himself is also present. Players may charter passage between ports for large sums ofcoinsranging from 200 to 3,200, destinations includeBrimhaven,Karamja,Land's End,Port Khazard,Port Phasmatys,Port Piscarilius,Port Sarim,Corsair Cove, and theShipyard. Crewmembers also runTrader Stan's Trading Post, an exotic store containing a variety of items, including the otherwise-unobtainableTyras helm.

The Crewmembers dress in very fine clothes, and can be asked about it, claiming that Trader Stan makes them wear the top-of-the-line garments to keep at the height of fashion. They then make a flippant comment about how they will resign if they fall overboard again.
