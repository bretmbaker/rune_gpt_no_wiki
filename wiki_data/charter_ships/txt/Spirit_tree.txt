Spirit treesare agnomishmethod oftransportation. Completion of theTree Gnome VillageorThe Grand Treequestwill allow limited access to the network. Players that complete both quests will then have full access. Full access allows players to travel from any available spirit treedirectlyto any other Spirit Tree in the network but limited access only allows one way trips based on which quest was completed.

CompletingTree Gnome Villageunlocks the tree inTree Gnome VillageandThe Grand Treeunlocks the tree in theGnome Stronghold. When travelling with limited access other trees will 'not be interested in talking.'

Spirit tree locations[edit|edit source]

Permanent locations:

Tree Gnome Villagein the middle of theGnome MazeGnome Stronghold(requires completion ofThe Grand Treequest to travel from this location. Before the quest, it can still be used as the destination while travelling from other trees).Battlefield of Khazard- just south ofWest Ardougne.North-east corner of theGrand ExchangeinVarrock.South-west corner ofFeldip Hills, next to theMyths' Guild.East of thePoison Waste(requires partial completion ofThe Path of Glouphrie)Prifddinas(requires completion ofSong of the Elvesquest)

Self-grown spirit tree locations(Farmingonly):

In south-easternEtceteria.Easternmost part ofPort Sarim.North-eastern part ofBrimhaven, near theAgility Arena.Hosidius, next to thesaltpetredeposits and south-east of theForthos Ruin.Inside the advanced tier of theFarming Guild. (Can be accessed before level 85 with the use of stat boosting items, but requires boosting to 85 everytime teleporting there is desired)

Additionally, with 75Construction:

Player-owned houseSuperior Garden- Thecrystal sawboost cannot be used, but otherboostsare possible. This does not count towards limit on spirit trees planted, and provides only 350 experience in both Farming and Construction.

One of the fastest ways to access a spirit tree is to teleport to theStronghold Slayer Cavewith aslayer ring- the player will arrive close to the tree. For low requirements and no cost, using anArdougne cloak, one canteleportto theArdougne Monasteryand use theKhazard Battlefieldtree just to the west. The Port Sarim spirit tree patch (83 Farming) is just south of theexplorer's ring's (2 or better) cabbage-port. When the player has aFarming capeor aSkills necklace, they can teleport to theFarming Guildand use the spirit tree there. One of the fastest ways to a spirit tree is by having planted one in a player-owned house (75Constructionand 83 Farming) and using aTeleport to housespell ormagic tablet. The fastest way before 83 Farming, is teleporting to the Grand Exchange (with a chargedring of wealthor teletab with the mediumVarrock Diarycompleted) and using the spirit tree there.

The fastest way to a spirit tree is using anAchievement Diary Capeand teleporting toElder Gnome child. Once the player has teleported to the Elder Gnome Child, the player will be 9-11 tiles away from a spirit tree. This is faster than the POH spirit tree despite being further away (no need to load a POH).

Farming[edit|edit source]

Players can grow their own spirit tree from aspirit saplingmade from aspirit seedonce they reach level 83Farming. Since spirit seeds and spirit saplings are untradeable, they can be difficult to obtain.Spirit tree patchescan be found in:

EtceteriaBrimhavenPort SarimHosidiusFarming Guild - advanced tier

Outside of a POH, players can have one spirit tree from level 83 to level 90, two spirit trees at level 91 and an unlimited amount at level 99. These levels can be boosted.

The growing time for a spirit tree is about 58 hours and 40 minutes. Growing a spirit tree yields 19,501.3 Farmingexperience, which is the sum of planting (199.5 experience) and checking health (19,301.8 experience).

Spirit trees cannot be cut down, so one simply uses aspadeon the tree to remove it. They do not yield roots when removed.

Payment[edit|edit source]

Spirit trees may be tended bygnomegardenersfor 5monkey nuts, 1monkey bar, and 1ground suqah tooth. Given the rarity of the seed, theexperiencegiven, and the length of time it takes to mature, having a gardener tend the growing plant is strongly recommended.

Construction[edit|edit source]

Players can plant their ownspirit treefrom aspirit saplingin theirSuperior Gardenat level 75Construction. Doing so also requires level 83 inFarming.Boostscan be used. This tree does not count towards the number of spirit trees that may be planted at one time. At level 95 Construction players can build aSpiritual Fairy Tree, which grants access to both a spirit tree and afairy ring.
