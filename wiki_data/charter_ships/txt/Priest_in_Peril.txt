The dungeon[edit|edit source]

Head back toVarrock Palace, using a Varrock teleport (optional) and talk to King Roald again. King Roald becomes enraged, and explains that thedogwas guarding the palace from attack. He instructs you to go back and fix it right away. If you don't have one, grab the bucket from above the kitchen, or buy one from the general store.

Travel east, and knock on the temple door again. This time, the door swings open. Kill one of thelevel 30Monks of Zamorakto get agolden key.

After receiving the key, climb up the stairs in the north-east corner of the room. Climb up the ladder of the south west corner of the room to reach the top floor, then talk toDrezel. Ask him why the river is such a good defence. Next, go back down the trap door into the dungeon. With the golden key in the inventory, the player can unlock the gate in thePaterdomusdungeon where theguardianwas located earlier. Proceed through the gate and keep walking until you are in the monument room. In this room, there are sevenmonumentsand awell. Study the monuments in order to find one holding aniron key, then use the golden key on that monument to swap the two keys. After obtaining the iron key, use your emptybucketon the nearby well to fill it withmurky water.

Each golden item can only be obtainedonce per account.

Return to the top floor of the temple, and use the iron key on the cell door. Enter the cell and talk toDrezelto get him to bless the murky water. Use theblessed wateron thecoffinjust outside of the cell to seal the vampyre within it. Talk toDrezelagain and he will tell the player to meet him in the dungeon.If the player completely exhausts his dialogue, Drezel will move to the mausoleum and the golden items can no longer be obtained.

Return to the dungeon and proceed through the gate located in the north-east corner of the monument room. Speak toDrezel, who will will request 50unnotedessence. If you need to, you can give him a mixture of bothruneandpure essence. Players with essence pouches can bring all 50 essence in a single trip if desired.
