| Charter Jingle

The song that plays when riding on a charter ship.

TheCharter Ships(often simply called charter) are a fleet of merchant ships which form a fairly extensive shipping transport infrastructure which includes popular docks as well as ports in remote locations, run by a wealthy merchant namedTrader Stanand hiscrew. Players must pay a fee ranging from 200 to 5,200coinsfor transportation on the charter ships. The fee is dependent on the destination - destinations which are further away or more remote than others have a higher cost. As with all nautical travel inRuneScape, the transportation time is only a few seconds, during which a map ofGielinorwith the destinations labelled is displayed, and an animation of a ship travelling from the point of embarkment to the destination is played. The short duration of the travel and the variety of destinations - the more remote of which having few alternate methods of transportation - make the charter ships favourable to other transportation systems, although some charter ship routes have higher costs than other transportation methods.

Trader crewmembersstand at the docks of each destination in the charter ships network, and Trader Stan himself is present at thePort Sarimdock. In addition to allowing players to charter the shipping network, the crewmembers also runTrader Stan's Trading Post, a more versatile and exotic form of a general store, which sells many items of interest as well as a few commodities which aren't stocked in specialty stores, such asTyras helms, which are unavailable anywhere else.

Getting to the charter ships[edit|edit source]

While travelling by charter ship can be convenient for players who can afford it, it can be a bit time consuming to get to the ship in the first place, as there is no teleport that goes right next to a ship. Some of the quickest ways to get to the ships are:

The fastest way is to use theConstruction capeorAldarin teleport tabletsto teleport to theAldarinhouse portal, which puts you close to the dock for the Aldarin ship. If your house is in Aldarin, you could also use theTeleport to Housespell or tablet.Use theLunar spellCatherby Teleportand run south.Use aPest Control teleportscroll and take the ship toPort Sarim, then go south east.Use theFishing Trawlerminigame teleportor the Lunar spellKhazard Teleportto Port Khazard.UseRada's blessingto teleport to theKourend Woodland, then run to theLand's Enddocks.Use anEctophialto go to theEctofuntusand enterPort Phasmatys. The docks are somewhat near the Port Phasmatys entrance.Use aCamelot Teleportand run south-east to Catherby and its docks.Use anArdougne Teleportto go to theArdougnemarketplace, run south toCaptain Barnabyand take his boat toBrimhaven. The boat trip arrives at the Brimhaven docks.If your house is inBrimhaven, you might consider usingTeleport to Housespell or tablet and running north.Aspirit treeinPort Sarim. Planting the spirit tree requires 83Farming; using the spirit tree network requires completion of theTree Gnome Villagequest.Alternatively, you can useExplorer's Ringteleport to cabbage patch next toPort Sarim, or the Rat Pitsminigame teleport.If your house is inRimmington, you can teleport to your house and run east toPort Sarim. Alternatively you can run west and talk toCabin Boy Colinto travel toCorsair Cove, where you can change and travel to your destination (requires completion ofThe Corsair Curse).

Fares[edit|edit source]

After completing theCabin Feverquest, the price between two locations, as displayed below, will halve the charter costs to 50%.Thering of charos(a)also halves the charter costs to 50%.These cost reductions can be combined to reduce the costs to 25%.Keep in mind the variance between destination fares. Similar to a layover, chartering to another destination first or using a non-charter ship like fromPort SarimtoMusa Pointcan net significant savings. For example, the 2,900 coins cost to travel fromPort PhasmatystoBrimhavencan be reduced by first chartering to Musa Point for 1,100 coins, then to Brimhaven for 200 coins.The only exception to this isPort Tyras, which has the same fare to and from every other port.
