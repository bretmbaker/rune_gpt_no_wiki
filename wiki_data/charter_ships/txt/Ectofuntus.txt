Port Phasmatys

TheEctofuntusis a fountain located within a temple north ofPort Phasmatys. Worshipping the Ectofuntus provides 4 times thePrayerexperiencecompared to burying bones, but requires you to obtain untradeablebonemealandbuckets of slimein order to worship it, which can be time consuming.

The Ectofuntus may be worshipped by clicking on it to consume a bucket of slime and any type of bonemeal held in your inventory. Bonemeal may be obtained by crushing any type of bones into apotusing thebone grinderfound on the upper floor of the temple. Buckets of slime may be obtained by filling abucketfrom thepool of slimefound in the underground area below a nearby trapdoor. They may also be purchased from atrader crewmemberon the Port Phasmatys dock.

After worshipping the Ectofuntus, talking to a nearbyghost disciplewhile wearing aghostspeak amuletorMorytania legs 2or above will reward you with 5ecto-tokensper worship. These tokens are used as a type of currency in the nearby Port Phasmatys and are required for the completion ofGhosts Ahoy. Prior to the completion of this quest, 2 Ecto-tokens are also required to enter the port when not using a charter ship. Ecto-tokens are additionally used to charge thebonecrusher.

Completing Ghosts Ahoy will reward the player with theectophialwhich may be used to teleport directly to the fountain. The ectophial refills itself from the fountain, allowing you to infinitely teleport to the Ectofuntus. It is strongly recommended to complete this quest before using the Ectofuntus as a method ofPrayer training, as it will greatly shorten the time it takes to retrieve the required materials and return to the fountain.

Using the Ectofuntus for Prayer training is a slower method than using agilded altaror theChaos altar, but may be attractive for those looking for a cheaper method that doesn't require access to aplayer-owned houseor theWilderness.

Completing tiers of theMorytania Diarywill save time in gathering the materials required to worship the Ectofuntus: theMorytania legsoffer 2, 5 or unlimited daily teleports to the pool of slime beneath the Ectofuntus with completion of the easy, medium and elite tiers of the diary. In addition, completing the medium, hard or elite tiers of the diary allows players to speak toRobinin Port Phasmatys to exchange 13, 26, or 39 bones, respectively, per day into bonemeal and slime.

Zealot's robesobtained from theShades of Mort'tonminigamewill provide a 5% chance (1.25% per piece) to prevent bonemeal and buckets of slime from being used while worshipping the Ectofuntus.

History[edit|edit source]

ThevampyresofMorytaniacame to the port town long ago, demanding blood tithes. The inhabitants were willing to do anything to stop them and, therefore, turned to the evil wizardNecrovarus, begging for help. Necrovarus told them to start digging to the north of the town and not to stop until they found a large pool of green slime. So, they did and discoveredEctoplasm. Then, he ordered a temple to be built above the pool, and in that temple, is a large fountain: the Ectofuntus.

Once everything was finished, the fountain emitted unholy power, creating a large force field around the settlement. This defended the town from the Vampyres, who couldn't breach the barrier. There was a horrible side effect, however, that Necrovarus counted on: all the people ofPort Phasmatysdied and their souls, instead of passing into the next world, were trapped by the field. From that day onward, Port Phasmatys has been a town inhabited solely by ghosts. All this was the real intent of Necrovarus, who planned to use the ghosts and the power of the Ectofuntus for his own evil ends, until he was thwarted in theGhosts Ahoyquest.

First floor[edit|edit source]

One ghost disciple haunts this floor and will explain the workings of the bone grinder.

The Ectofuntus dungeon[edit|edit source]

The dungeon is entered through themetal trapdooron theground floor[UK]1stfloor[US]. The only object of interest in the dungeon is the pool of slime at the centre, where players can fillbuckets with slime.

The dungeon is organised in four tiers, descending in turn from the outer tier (Tier 1 on the diagram) to the innermost one ("Ectopool" on the diagram). Although the dungeon looks compact, the tiers and placement of the stairs actually results in a considerable walk from the ladder to the ectopool, as on each tier, the player must walk all the way to the other side to get to the stairs.

The level 58Agility shortcutgreatly cuts the time it takes to walk to the ectopool. The shortcut can be used in both directions. From the ectopool, however, players with theEctophialin their inventory can use it to return to theground floor[UK]1stfloor[US]even faster.

Note that the northern section of Tier 2 is cut by Tier 3 and thus cannot be traversed. Players must use the southern section of this tier.

How to worship[edit|edit source]

|  |  |

Before worshipping the Ectofuntus you must obtainbuckets of slimeandbonemeal. The optimal inventory when making these yourself from the temple is: 9buckets, 9potsand 9bonesof any type. Anectophialis highly recommended to save time if you have already completedGhosts Ahoy. Aghostspeak amuletorMorytania legs 2or abovemustbe equipped to talk to theghost disciplesto receiveecto-tokens.

Zealot's robesobtained from theShades of Mort'tonminigamemay be equipped to provide a 5% chance (1.25% per piece) to prevent bonemeal and buckets of slime from being used while worshipping the Ectofuntus.

Buckets may be substituted for buckets of slime when purchasing them instead. This can be done by purchasing 10 at a time from atrader crewmemberon thePort Phasmatysdock, then world hopping and banking at the nearby bank. If done efficiently this will be faster than filling the buckets yourself.

Players who have completed the medium, hard, or elite tiers of theMorytania Diarycan haveRobinin the Port Phasmatys pub convert 13, 26, or 39 bones, respectively, per day into bonemeal and slime.

Filling buckets of slime[edit|edit source]

Players who have completed tiers of theMorytania Diarymay teleport directly to thepool of slime; otherwise, enter the trapdoor to the west of the Ectofuntus. If you have 58Agilityuse theweathered wallshortcutin front of you, otherwise walk around to the opposite side of the cavern and climb down the stairs, then repeat this process for the next two sets of stairs. Use a bucket on the pool of slime: this will automatically fill all the buckets in your inventory over the next few seconds. Use your ectophial to return to the fountain, or walk back up the stairs and up the ladder.

Grinding bones[edit|edit source]

Go up the stairs east of the Ectofuntus. Use a bone on the loader located on the right side of thebone grinder, making sure tousethe bones and not bury them. This will begin an automated process where the player will load one of the bones, turn the wheel, empty the bin to retrieve the completed bonemeal, and then automatically repeat this for each subsequent bone. However, interacting with each part of the grinder will speed up this process.

Worship the Ectofuntus[edit|edit source]

Return to the Ectofuntus and click on it to consume each set of bonemeal and slime. Drop a bucket or pot to free an inventory space, then talk to aghost discipleto earn 5ecto-tokensper set. Once 1000 tokens have been earned but not claimed, further attempts to worship will produce the message "There isn't room to put any more in." The tokens must be collected to continue worshipping.

Efficiency[edit|edit source]

Weight-reducing gearis recommended, such asgraceful clothingorboots of lightnessand aspottedorspottier cape. Theectophialteleport to the Ectofuntus and anamulet of gloryor aring of duelingto teleport close to abankis also recommended. TheCraftingorFishing capealong withMorytania legs 3/4are other good options for banking.

Method 1: For players looking to reduce the amount of trips made, the most efficient way to use the Ectofuntus is to first get all of theslimerequired (recommended, as mentioned above, to purchase from thetrader crewmemberand world hop), then grind half of the amount of total bones in lots of 13 per trip. Afterwards, the inventory setup would be 12 buckets of slime, 6crushed bones, and 6 uncrushed bones if using teleportationrunes, or 13 buckets of slime, 7 crushed bones, and 7 uncrushed bones if walking to the bank or usingteleport jewellery. This setup results in the minimum amount of trips possible for grinding and worshipping, versus the traditional setup of 9 bones, 9pots, and 9 slime buckets.

Route:

UseectophialWorshipGrind the remaining bones in inventoryWorship (1 crushed bone will remain)BankRepeat

Method 2: For more experienced players, there is a slightly faster method, which utilisesteletabsor therune pouch. For this method to work optimally, players must have anectophial, 58Agilityand have completed the mediumVarrockAchievement Diary. A reward for completing the diary is the ability to change the location of yourVarrock teleportto theGrand Exchange. Simply walking a bit north using a Varrock tab, allows for quick and cheap access to a bank. A rune pouch filled withlaw,fire, andair runesmay be used instead of the teletabs. Lastly, instead of a rune pouch you may wield asmoke battlestaffand carry law runes in your inventory. Therefore, an optimal inventory for gathering buckets of slime would consist of: Ectophial, Varrock teletabs OR rune pouch OR smoke battlestaff and law runes, and 26 buckets. This puts your route as follows: Ectophial teleport, useAgility shortcut, gatherslime, use Varrock teleport, bank and repeat.

Forbonemeal, you would follow a similar plan. Your inventory would consist of: Ectophial, Varrock teletabs, 13pots, and 13 bones of your choosing. The route is also the same: Ectophial, grind bones, Varrock teleport, bank, repeat.

As such, this method does recommend that players separate the job into three stages. Getting the slime first, then grinding bones, and finally worshipping, using the same method as before.

Inventory for worshipping:

EctophialVarrock teleportsEcto-tokens12slime12bonemeal

UseectophialWorshipCollectecto-tokensUseVarrock teleportBankRepeat

Note that alternate means of teleportation may be cheaper, such as aring of dueling, to teleport to theCastle Warsbank chest. However, usingjewelleryis more click intensive, and more prone to mistake (accidentally teleporting to theEmir's Arena, for example). Since for jewellery, you have to right click, then left click, and constantly withdraw new items when they break, players will find that one click teletabs are a more simple, faster, and fool proof way to get around.

If players have the medium, hard, or eliteMorytania Diarycompleted, they can speak toRobinin thePort Phasmatyspub to convert 13, 26, or 39 bones per day, respectively, intobonemeal. These bones cannot be noted and players will also receive the equivalent amount ofslimefrom Robin, so make sure to only bring 13 bones at a time - similar to an ectofuntus run.

An ideal inventory will consist of 13 bones,ectophial, and an additional teleport (such as aCrafting capeorrune pouchwith appropriate teleport runes). The player should also equip their highest tier ofMorytania legsor aghostspeak amuletin order to claim their tokens.

Collecting bonemeal and slime from Robin allows from one to three (depending on Diary status) efficient trips to the Ectofuntus that do not require bone grinding or slime to be collected.

This reward can be used to easily gain 4,000, 8,000, or 12,000Prayerexperienceon adailybasis (usingdragonorwyvern bones) as the process shouldn't take more than 5 minutes even with three trips. This will also grant 65, 130, or 195Ecto-tokens, which can be used to upkeep abonecrusher. Doing so will provide 1,625, 3,250, or 4,875 charges depending on the completed Diary tier.
