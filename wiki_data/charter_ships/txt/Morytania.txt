Morytania(pronouncedmor-ee-TAY-nee-ah) is amembers-only area in the easternmost part ofGielinor. Players must complete thePriest in Perilquest to enter. Often described as a land of evil, the land is filled with manyaggressivecreatures such asvampyres,werewolves,ghasts, and theundead. It is currently ruled byLord Drakan.

Prior to theGod Wars, Morytania was marked by fertile land and thriving cities, and was occupied bySaradominstsandZarosians. In theThird Age, the vampyreLord Lowerniel Vergidiyad Drakanbetrayed the Zarosians in the name ofZamorak, ousting the Saradominists and turning the land to aswampin the process. Lord Drakan then erected a wall around the former Saradominist capital ofHallowvale, turning it into a dense concentration camp and committing genocide against theIcyenerace.

Morytania has its ownachievement diary, released on5 March2015. Manyquestsand pieces of high-level content also take place in the region, such as theTheatre of Blood,Barrows, andthe Nightmare.

Towns and cities[edit|edit source]

Silverea[edit|edit source]

A small area marked by theSaradominist templeon theRiver Salve. It is the gateway to Morytania and protects the lands ofMisthalinandAsgarniafrom the evils that lurk in the swamplands. In thePriest in Perilquest, it is revealed thatZamorakianmonks overtook the temple and murdered all the Saradominists except forDrezel, the head monk. The player is tasked with helping Drezel, under the orders ofKing RoaldofVarrock, to purify the Salve once more beforeLord Drakanand his armies gain intel of the river's corruption.

Canifis[edit|edit source]

Canifis is the first town one stumbles upon in Morytania. A small town east of the temple Paterdomus, the town is notable for its residents beingwerewolves. Only the holy weapon,Wolfbane, can prevent werewolves from transforming into their wolf forms when attacked.

Port Phasmatys[edit|edit source]

A town cursed by the evil necromancer,Necrovarus. Port Phasmatys is one of the few towns not under Lord Drakan's control due to theEctofuntus, an altar where the citizens worshipped ectoplasmic energy to protect them from theVampyresuntil they slowly lost their minds. Now, the citizens are stuck in the mortal world and unable to move on to the Spirit world.

Like Canifis, Port Phasmatys was a thriving port city until Drakan noticed its existence and invaded. It can be accessed by a toll gate, which costs twoecto-tokens, though for those who have completed theGhosts Ahoyquest, entry is free. Alternatively, acharter shipcan be taken to bypass the ecto-token cost.

Mort'ton[edit|edit source]

A miserable village infested withshadesandafflicted villagers. Mort'ton used to be a thriving trading village in south-western Morytania until a mysterious plague that originated from theSanguinesti regiondescended upon the area, turning the citizens into mindless zombies and reanimating the dead as deadly shades that still haunt the village to this day. It plays a major role in theShades of Mort'tonquest, as well as theShades of Mort'ton minigame.

Burgh de Rott[edit|edit source]

The last free human settlement in Morytania. Like Meiyerditch, the town was built after theGod Warsby refugees ofHallowvale. The town is in shambles, with the locals starving and facing demanding blood tithes. Despite facing all these difficulties, Burgh de Rott still stands strong in its attempt to liberate Morytania from Drakan's rule and to exterminate the vampyres once and for all. It is heavily involved in theIn Aid of the Myrequequest, where the player helps the locals rebuild the town and helpThe Myreque, an organisation bent on the overthrow of Drakan, relocate here.

Meiyerditch[edit|edit source]

Formerly known asHallowvale, Meiyerditch was once a Saradominist city that was ruled by theIcyenequeenEfaritay. After the God Wars, Lord Drakan overthrew the queen and erected the "Great Vyrewall" to keep the citizens of Hallowvale from escaping. After converting the city and its infrastructure into a massive concentration camp, Meiyerditch became the home to theVyrewatch, the airborne vanguard of theSanguinestiregion. Here, the locals are farmed for blood like cattle in a maze-like ghetto.

The ghetto is divided into six sectors, with one sector tithed for blood each week. Dying citizens and stray animals litter the streets waiting for the comfort of death to take them out of their agony. The SanguinestiMyrequedivision perform their duties here under the order ofSafalaan. This city is heavily involved in theDarkness of Hallowvalequest.

Darkmeyer[edit|edit source]

Darkmeyer is the impenetrable vampyric capital of Morytania that lies in the northern half of the Sanguinesti Region. The majority of the city is populated by upper tier vyres, being the Vyrewatch and theVyrelordsandladies. Humans are also taken into Darkmeyer time to time, mainly as either prisoners or slaves that are forced into chattel work, servitude, or even execution.Castle Drakanis also found in the western half of Darkmeyer and is presumably where Lord Drakan and his nobility live.

Ver Sinhaza[edit|edit source]

The former palace of Queen Efaritay found in south-eastern Meiyerditch. The castle hosts theTheatre of Blood, a colosseum where the citizens of Meiyerditch can take on various monsters and vampyric experiments in hope to obtain their freedom. The castle and the theatre are overseen by the vyrelady noble,Verzik Vitur.

Slepe[edit|edit source]

A mysterious town found east of the Sanguinesti Region and the only known predominantly Zamorakian town populated by humans. Slepe seems to fare better than most Morytanian towns and does not face pressure from the vyres, despite their presence in the town. The town, however, has begun to suffer a mysterious sleeping plague, and theCrombwick Manorto the north has fallen under the control of vampyres.

Other features[edit|edit source]

Fenkenstrain's Castle- A creepy castle in the far north of Morytania. Fenkenstrain's Castle used to be a thriving micronation called the Lordship of the North Coast. This micronation was founded byMisthalinianpioneers who allowed anyone to join their lordship, and who could practice any religion they wished. TheVyrewatchsoon learned of the lordship and began demanding tithes from its inhabitants. The micronation collapsed whenDr Fenkenstrain, the local physician, killed the last owner,Lord Rologarth, and scattered his body across the Haunted Woods. The history of the Lordship is uncovered in theCreature of Fenkenstrainquest.

Slayer Tower- An ancient tower that is the host of unspeakable atrocities. The tower used to belong toViggora, one ofZamorak's most trusted generals who helped him overthrowZaros. The tower since then has gone in to ruin and is now filled to the brim with undead and demonic creatures that can be killed via theSlayerskill.

Mort Myre Swamp- A vast swamp in western Morytania. Comprising most of Morytania, the swamp is full of disgustingsnails,swamp decay, andghasts: adventurers who perished in the swamp and were corrupted by the decay, becoming floating spectres who rot the food of those who visit the swamp. In theTemple Trekkingminigame, it's revealed that starving adventurers who get lost in the swamp turn into a "ghastly" state, where they slowly succumb to starvation and turn into ghasts.

Haunted Woods- The Haunted Woods are to the east ofCanifisand the west ofPort Phasmatys. The woods are host toleeches,bats,spiders, andFeral Vampyres—vampyres believed to be less "civilised" than their aristocratic counterparts. Feral Vampyres can be harmed with any weapon and usually stalk thehollow treesthat make up the woods. South of the woods is agraveyardwhere the vampyre lordDessouslives. Dessous is fought in theDesert Treasure Iquest.

Barrows- The Barrows is a graveyard to the east ofMort'ton. It is the resting place of theBarrows brothers, whose brave efforts to liberate Morytania fromThe Drakansproved futile. The brothers were buried here when they were brutally murdered by the vyres. Later, aMahjarratby the name of Sliske reanimated them aswightsto serve him. To this day, they still lurk in the tunnel maze that is their resting place, watching, should anyone try to plunder their coffins for their rewards.

Mort Ridge Mine- A huge mine in south-western Morytania. The mine is rich inmithrilandadamantiteveins and is haunted by those who perished within the mine and possessed animated objects. The mine was once administrated by the Drakans but once theRiver Salvepierced through the mine, Drakan abandoned the project all together and left bothhumansandvyrewatchin the mine.Treus Daythwas left behind by Drakan and was killed when the mine collapsed. Since then, he became a demented spirit who haunted the mine to this very day and brutally murders anyone who trespasses on his domain. He is fought in theHaunted Minequest.

Tarn's Lair- A split-off of the Mort Ridge Mine. The Lair is overseen byTarn Razorlor, a wicked necromancer who filled his dungeon with traps, the undead, atoad batta, andterror dogs.

Lore[edit|edit source]

Pre-God Wars[edit|edit source]

Before theGod Wars, Morytania was a peaceful land, with the northern half of Morytania being a part of ZarosianForinthry. After Saradomin arrived in Gielinor, the southern half of Morytania was conquered and became Saradominist kingdom known asHallowvale, ruled byQueen Efaritay. Taking advantage of the Zamorakian uprising against Zaros in theSecond Age, Saradominists destroyed Zarosian settlements in a loose alliance with Zamorak known as the Zarosian Extermination. Upon Zamorak's return, however, his forces overthrew the Saradominists and conquered the region for themselves.

Early vampyric control[edit|edit source]

After the God Wars,Lord Lowerniel Vergidiyad Drakanand his army of vampyres and werewolves took control of Hallowvale and disposed of Queen Efaritay, twisting the realm into a swamp full of decaying plant life and infertile land. He then created the Great Vyrewall, which partitioned Hallowvale into the cities of Meiyerditch and Darkmeyer, the latter of which he used to build hiscastle.

Shortly after Drakan's takeover, a Saradominist crusade was led into Morytania in an attempt to liberate it from Lord Drakan. The sixBarrows Brotherswere given powers by theMahjarratSliskethat allowed them to reach the walls ofDarkmeyer; however, this was part of a larger game by Sliske, which he concluded by removing their powers at the gates, allowing Lord Drakan to slaughter the crusaders.

Transformation of Hallowvale[edit|edit source]

Meiyerditch was soon turned into a bloodfarming concentration camp administrated byVanstrom Klause, captain of theVyrewatch. To keep the vyres from killing off the population too quickly, Meiyerditch was divided into six sectors, where one sector was tithed each week by the vyres. After some time, the cities ofBurgh de RottandMort'tonwere formed by escaping refugees from the cities, although the vyres ignored both cities.

During this time, both Meiyerditch and Drakan became legends due to the isolation of the region. This led to citizens ofMisthalinandAsgarniaconquering the now-vacant lands of northern Morytania, which weren't under Drakan's influence. Towns and settlements such asCanifis,Port Phasmatys, and theLordship of the North Coastsoon formed and became prosperous trading hubs. Mort'ton eventually became a popular trading village as well, but a mysterious plague turned the population into mindless zombies and rose the dead as mindless shades.

Drakan soon noticed the towns springing up on the northern coast and soon took action to annex these locations into his empire. Canifis was the only town that submitted to his doings; the Lordship eventually fell, and Port Phasmatys used ectoplasm to shield their town from the vyres, only for their population to die and turn into ghosts unable to move on to the spirit world.

Division along the River Salve[edit|edit source]

As revealed in theIn Aid of the Myrequequest,seven priestly warriorsdrew back the darkness of Misthalin across theRiver Salveand entered Morytania in the later Fourth Age. One warrior,Ivandis Seergaze, went further into Morytania and was slain by Lord Drakan. His resting place was unknown, and it was rumoured he carried an object of his channelling power, known as theRod of Ivandis.

These warriors, while unable to conquer the region, successfully defendedMisthalinandAsgarniafrom invading Morytanian forces during theMisthalin - Morytania WaratSilvarea. In the final battle of the war, the warriors blessed theRiver Salveand created a barrier to prevent Morytanian invasion in the future. This blessing has held, although there have been several instances of crossing through various methods. The warriors remain some ofhumanity's most universally celebrated historical figures, being frequently referenced in Misthalinian lore and history.

Fifth Age[edit|edit source]

Morytania is now almost completely controlled by thevampyricrace, and is inhabited by vampyres,werewolves,ghosts,shades,ghasts, the undead,leeches, andhumanswho are eitherafflictedor enslaved by the Vampyres. In response to their oppressive control, an organisation called theMyrequehas sprung up and dedicated their lives to stopping Drakan and his evil ways. They have formed organisations in Burgh de Rott and Meiyerditch, and are working to liberate the enslaved peoples of Morytania and overthrow Drakan once and for all. Recently,Vanstrom Klausehas recognised the Myreque and Burgh de Rott, and will waste no time in destroying them both, unless an adventurer can help the fight against him.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Morytania might be a pun on "Mauritania", a country in Northern Africa, as well as a reference tomemento mori, due to the region's theme of death and withering.It's also possible that it's derived from "moritane", which roughly means "blackened", in J.R.R. Tolkein's fictional language Quenya.Morytania was originally named Transilvania, a reference toTransylvania.[1]If a player somehow enters Morytania without completingPriest in Peril,Abidor Crankwill appear and say "Well, this is no good at all! You'll never survive in Morytania, you'll have to go back.", then proceed to teleport them out. Alternatively, a vampyre will appear and knock the player out causing them to wake up at the entrance toPaterdomus Temple, with the accompanying game message stating "'A vampyre notices you and swoops down... You're knocked out, but a bunch of mercenaries save you from the swamp.'"Players who stand directly next to the bench's north side (near theornate railingshortcut), then log out and back in, will cause this phenomenon to occur despite being outside of Morytania.
