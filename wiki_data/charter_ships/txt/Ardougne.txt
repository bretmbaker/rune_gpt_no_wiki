Ardougne(Jagex:/…ëÀêrÀàd…î…™n/(üîälisten)arr-DOYN[1]) is thecapitaland largest city of the Kingdom ofKandarin. It is divided intoEast ArdougneandWest Ardougne. West Ardougne is closed off to the general public because of a mysterious "plague" affecting the inhabitants, but you can slowly gain complete access by completing the first few quests of thePlague Cityquest line. It is also probably the best place to find thieves in all ofGielinor.

Etymology[edit|edit source]

Ardougne is named after theRiver Dougne, which flows through the city directly east ofArdougne Castle.[2]

There may also be a connection to theArdignas family, who have ruled Kandarin from Ardougne since at least Year 101 of the Fifth Age. It is unclear whether the city or the family came first, and whether either is named after the other.
