TheLunar spellbookis aspellbookthat players can access upon completion of thequestLunar Diplomacy. Making extensive use ofastral runes, the spellbook is primarily oriented towards utility spells and combat-support spells, reducing or eliminating the need for certain items and equipment to carry out certain tasks. A larger set of spells is accessible to players who have completed the questDream Mentor.

The spells in this spellbook use all rune types exceptwrath.

If the player were to lose the skill requirements after completing the quest, such as duringDeadman Mode, 65 Magic and 40 Defence without boosts are still required to cast any Lunar spell.

Switching spellbooks[edit|edit source]

Players must pray at theAstral Altaron the south-east end ofLunar Isleto switch between the Lunar spellbook and theStandard spellbook. Astral runes can also be crafted at this altar using theRunecraftskill; players cannot craft astral runes throughThe Abyss. An easy way to travel to the Lunar Isle is by using aLunar isle teleportscroll or aMoonclan teleporttablet. If you intend to change your spellbook, be sure to bring a teleport to leave the island.

Players who have level 80 inConstruction(or 75 with a +5spicy stewboost) can build alunar altarwithin theirAchievement Gallery, allowing them to freely switch between the standard and lunar spellbooks without having to travel to the Astral Altar. The crystal saw's +3 boost cannot be combined with the spicy stew's +5 boost since the achievement gallery requires 80 construction, and the saw's boost does not work on adding new rooms to your POH.
