Trivia[edit|edit source]

The set of staircasesin the middle of the Woodlands are a reference to the stories told by a US Forest Service Search and Rescue Officer in the subreddit/r/nosleep. In particular, the story tells of mysterious staircases that are said to appear despite the out-of-place setting of the forest, and climbing them results in disastrous consequences, such as a blood vessel in the brain exploding, or a hand getting sliced off.BeforeA Kingdom Divided's release, the woodland had four bears (two adults, two cubs) where the house north-east of the bank is. Since the rework, the area now has three bears (one adult, two cubs).
