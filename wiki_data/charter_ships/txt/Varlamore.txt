TheKingdom of Varlamore, also known as theShining Kingdom, is akingdomfound in the continent ofZeah, found far west of the mainland across theWestern Sea. It is one of the three regions that make up the continent, the other two being the Kingdom ofGreat Kourendand theKebos Lowlands.[1]Like Great Kourend, it stands as one of the largest kingdoms inGielinor, and one of the most distinct, given its isolation from the rest of the mainland.

The kingdom is ruled by a monarchy, withZyanyi Arkancurrently reigning as the Sun Queen.[2]To the distinction of other human kingdoms, who primarily worshipSaradomin, the Varlamorians practice a religion officially named asLosanium, which involves the worship of the sun godRalos,[3][4]and the moon godRanul; however, most people focus their worship to one of the two. Varlamore is also littered with ruins of theOld Ones,[5]an ancient race that went extinct sometime during the beginning of theGod Wars.

Varlamore can only be accessed upon completion ofChildren of the Sun, after which the player is directed outside the east Varrock gate to talk toRegulus Cento, who will take the player to the kingdom's capital,Civitas illa Fortis, via quetzal - a large species of bird native to the region that act as mounts. Players must first travel to Varlamore via Regulus before other methods of accessing it are allowed.

History[edit|edit source]

Early history[edit|edit source]

The region that would later become known as Varlamore was first inhabited by an ancient race known as theOld Ones, who were strong worshippers ofRalosandRanul, building structures such asNeypotzliandTapoyauik. However, during the earlyThird Age,[6]they began to face extinction, and devised a ritual to attempt soul transference. While successful in doing so for a new body, the attempt to do so for themselves went horribly wrong, resulting in the creation ofthe Strangler[7]- a parasite presumably intended to play a role in their transference rituals that instead hastened their extinction.[8]

Hundreds of years later, the continent would begin to be settled by refugees, eventually foundingGreat Kourendthousands of years later. It was not until 1,030 years ago that refugees, fleeing fromXeric's reign during Kourend'sAge of Strife, would flee southwards over the previously unexploredCustodia Mountains.[9]Among the refugees, there were three notable groups: TheImcando dwarves, theTalkasti, and thePericans.

TheImcando dwarves, who lived inLovakengj, were the first to flee Kourend and foundedCam Torum, an underground city beneathRalos' Rise.[10][11]TheTalkasti, who initially lived nomadic lives, settled in theTlati Rainforestbefore establishing permanent settlements likeTal Teklan.[12]Lastly, thePericansfounded the town of Fortis, and eventually became known asCivitas illa Fortiswhen the three groups united to found Varlamore.[13]

Founding of Varlamore[edit|edit source]

Though the dwarves of Cam Torum mostly kept themselves isolated from the affairs of the Talkasti and Pericans, the latter two groups regularly found themselves in conflict.[14]The Talkasti, who secretly practisedLosaniumin theTemple to Ranul and Ralos, were able to openly practice their religion, and was eventually adopted by the Pericans as well.[15]

This caused the two groups to come together, rapidly expanding the region and their populations. 100 years after Fortis was founded, it was decreed that a second settlement be built to address the issues that came with population growth.[16]One of the candidates for a new settlement was the islands of Tempest Bay, but was not a strong contender due to the unstable ground and the presence of hill giants led by theCloud Titan.[17]However, with their defeat, presumably with a united force of Pericans and Talkasti, the construction ofTempestusbegan, and with it the founding of Varlamore.[18]TheRiver Varla, previously the border between the two groups, was used as the name and symbol for the now-unified kingdom.[19]

Monstrous Threats[edit|edit source]

Though internal conflicts between Varlamore appear to be nonexistent, there were some threats to the kingdom in the form of monsters 200 years ago, all of which were defeated in the span of 20 years with the help of an adventurer fromHosidius,[20]who travelled to Varlamore to escape theWar of the Five Housesas he refused to kill people, preferring to use his skills in monster slaying.[21]

One of these was a weather demon who terrorised theAvium Savannahwith torrential rainstorms.[22]Recognising the potential threat toCam Torum, theImcando dwarvesrequested the adventurer to deal with the demon, giving him an enchanted sword forged from an alloy of silver and some mystical metal tuned to harm demons.[23]With thedemonbanesword in hand, the demon was promptly slain.[24]

Though theCloud Titanwas believed to have been slain during the attack on Tempest Bay 900 years ago,its armourwas never recovered until the adventurer brought it to theGrand Museumand donated it to the staff.[25]Though he discovered that the Cloud Titan survived the attack and defeated it by himself, historians considered this unlikely.[26]

The last of these threats was theColossal Wyrm. Presumably created by adragonkinnamedKaruulm, the wyrm was believed to have come from deep within theHailstorm Mountainsbefore settling in the Avium Savannah for unknown reasons.[27]Warriors from across the kingdom, including the adventurer, banded together to defeat it at the southern end of the savannah,[28]where its skeleton remains today as a famous landmark; one ofits fangsis on display on the top floor of the Grand Museum.

War of Betrayal[edit|edit source]

Though the kingdom managed to keep a stable relationship withGreat Kourendsince their founding, this changed approximately 100 years ago whenImafore Tullusascended the throne and reorganised the kingdom into the Varlamorian Empire.[29]

Public opinion of Emperor Imafore was mixed, with his policies being controversial at best.[30]As part of a celebration of his 30th birthday, he invited the Kourend royal family to Varlamore, giving them a grand tour of the kingdom. However, during the grand feast at theSunrise PalaceinCivitas illa Fortis, he killed the royal family by poisoning their drinks,[31]prompting Great Kourend to declare war on Varlamore. His reasons for doing so remain unknown, as he took the secret to his grave.[32]

The War of Betrayal, as it would become known, was deeply unpopular amongst the Varlamorian people.[33]Despite this, the war lasted six years, ending at Battle of the Proudspire when Imafore and his forces were captured by freedom fighters led by his cousin,Mezpah Arkan.[34]Imafore was promptly executed, ending the Tullus dynasty and the war.

The Arkan Dynasty[edit|edit source]

Now the Sun King, one of Mezpah Arkan's first acts was to behead everystatue of his cousin,[35]and declaring it a crime to remove them as a warning not to repeat the mistakes of the past.[36]King Kharedst III, in the hope of repairing Kourend's relations with Varlamore, ordered an envoy be sent to transport theRoyal Accord of Twillto be displayed in theGrand Museum, despite the protests of his people.[37]However, the Accord became lost at sea, and remained so until it was recently recovered byArtur Hosidius, and remains safely stored in theLibrary Historical ArchiveinArceuus.[38]As both kingdoms have not requested the other for the Accord, areplicaof the original is displayed in the Grand Museum instead.

Even years later, the betrayal of Emperor Imafore remains fresh in the minds of Kourend's people, and the trust has yet to be regained,[39]although it appears thatZyanyi Arkan, Mezpah's great-granddaughter, is eager to ease tensions between the two kingdoms during her visit toGreat Kourend.[40][41]

Contact with the mainland[edit|edit source]

Since the kingdom's founding, travel outside Varlamore was heavily restricted; members of theCollege of BardsinTempestuswere among the only people allowed to do so,[42]and even then lots of paperwork were required to be filled out.[43]

In time, just as theKourend Councilestablished trade routes between them the mainland, opening up the kingdom for safe travel and trade,Queen Zyanyi Arkanwas interested in doing the same for Varlamore,[44]which was one of the goals of her ambitious great-grandfather.[45]

Varlamore first began establishing diplomatic ties with the rest of the kingdoms by sending a delegation toMisthalin. This delegation, led byPrince Itzla Arkan, was also accompanied byServius, the Teokan (priest)[46]of Ralos,Ennius Tullus, andFuria Tullus, along with sixKnights of Varlamore. After a plot to assassinate the Teokan was foiled by an adventurer, who stumbled upon the plotters by chance after learning of the delegation's arrival, a treaty was signed between the two kingdoms, opening up Varlamore to the mainland for the first time.

The Twilight Emissaries[edit|edit source]

Itzla would later arrange a meeting with the adventurer, revealing to them that Servius was his father. Due to various policies, the only people who were aware of the overseas visit would have to be one of the delegation and thus tasked them with finding the suspect. The adventurer eventually discovered evidence pointing to Velam, who was promptly slain byEnnius Tullus. This concerned the adventurer, as Velam was not given a chance to explain his reasoning or motive as to why he would do so and they informed Itzla of it, who promised to keep an eye on the twins. He then began to explain to them about theTwilight Emissaries, a cult dedicated to theOld Ones' "Final Dawn" - bringing about an end to the world. Suddenly, cultists stormed the palace, but were repelled by the adventurer and the guards. To their surprise, despite none of them having made it inside, Servius was gravely wounded andMetzliwas missing, indicating that the plot was much deeper than expected.

Despite the Queen's protests, Prince Itzla insisted on going undercover with the adventurer in an infiltration mission into the cult, where both were tasked with passing the cult's trials in theTower of Ascensionto join their ranks. At theTwilight Temple, where the cult resides, they discover that Metzli is indeed the Augur, or leader of the cult. During the initiation ceremony, she reveals  that she had dedicated herself to leading the group in service of the Tullus twins, whom she believes to be the mortal forms ofRalosandRanul, and that the cult's goal is to find a route toMokhaiotl- a location said to be at the centre of the world where Ralos and Ranul will reach and unite to bring about the Final Dawn.

During the infiltration, Prince Itzla and the adventurer are tasked to exploreTapoyauik, a ruined fortress of the Old Ones beneath the Twilight Temple, as the cult believes they left behind secrets needed to reach Mokhaiotl. Upon reaching the bottom of the fortress, they discover its guardian - a powerfulfrost naguanamedAmoxliatl. She claims Mokhaiotl, the Tlati archive, is not a place for humans, deeming them unworthy. As this happens, Prince Itzla is teleported away, revealing that Metzli and the Tullus twins have been following him and the adventurer, before leaving themselves to avoid the wrath of Amoxliatl. The adventurer is forced to face her, and upon her defeat is banished from the fortress. As the adventurer heads toSunrise Palaceto informServiusof the new developments, he claims that Mokhaiotl is not a place that can be reached and that he will inform the Queen, assuring the adventurer that they will be involved in dealing with the cult when the time comes.

Culture[edit|edit source]

LikeGreat Kourend, it too spent a long period of time isolated from the mainland, and as a result has a unique cultural identity among the other kingdoms.

Language[edit|edit source]

Although the people of Varlamore can communicate with other inhabitants of Gielinor in the common tongue, they also have their own language and insert phrases from it into their colloquial speech. Their vocabulary is loosely based on the real-world Nahuatl language spoken in present-day Mexico.

Though official translations do not exist, context clues are used to infer their meaning:

Iknami- a term of endearment; equivalent to "my friend" (Nahuatl:icniuhtli'brother, friend')Kuani- a positive exclamation; equivalent to "excellent" (Nahuatl:cualli'good')Nilsal- a greeting; equivalent to "hello" or "greetings" (Nahuatl:niltze'greetings')Tetamo- an expression of frustration, disappointment, or disbelief; equivalent to "oh no" or an expletive like "damn it"Timoiva- a parting phrase; equivalent to "goodbye", "best wishes", or "see you around" (Nahuatl:timo-itazque'we will see one another later')

Religion[edit|edit source]

Losanium is the primary religion of Varlamore, involving the worship of the sun godRalosand the moon godRanul. While the people of Varlamore are aware of other gods acknowledged on the mainland, Losanium remains overwhelmingly dominant.[47]

Of the two gods, worship of Ralos is considered the more popular of the two,[48]as Ranul is associated with death. However, Ranul is also a god of learning and knowledge, and thus is worshipped more often by academics.[49]

Transportation[edit|edit source]

There are several ways to reach Varlamore, but all require the player to first travel viaRegulus Cento, located near the eastVarrockgates, after completingChildren of the Sunbefore other transportation methods become usable.

Development history[edit|edit source]

The first concept of Varlamore was from a Reddit post on 26 April 2016 by a user namedGentleTractor, titledZeah Redesigned, which addressed the design issues that players had withGreat Kourendsince its release three months earlier. When the rework to the Great Kourend, which was done byMod West, was released on 17 November 2016, he included aKnight of VarlamoreinKourend Castle, signifying GentleTractor's contributions as canon; many of the locations from that viral post would also make its way into the game's canon, such as Civitas illa Fortis, the Avium Savannah, and Tempest Bay.

According to GentleTractor, "Varlamore" was constructed out of base word sounds, rather than coming from a word with meaning; he had looked through a list of region names and tried to pick out the most "RuneScapey" qualities of them to create a fitting name, and settled on a three-syllable word that started with "V", as it was a less common letter. "Var" was taken from "Varrock" for a subtle familiarity, "la" was added as a syllable that rolled off the tongue nicely, and "more" was added as he needed one "more" syllable to create the name.

For "Auburnvale", the name came from GentleTractor's personal love of the autumn/fall season and a desire to create an autumn-themed location for the game. "Auburn" was taken from "autumn" and the associated colour, and adding a suffix that made it sound "more medieval-fantasy". Lastly, "Avium Savannah" came about from his desire to put Civitas illa Fortis into a unique biome that hadn't been explored in game (a vast savannah). With the capital city having Latin roots to its name, "Avium" was chosen from the Latin word "āvĭum", which he believed to mean either a pathless region/wilderness/desert or a lonely/solitary place.

Though additional aspects of the kingdom would make its way into the game, such as the booksVarlamore envoyandImafore's betrayal, as well as the appearance ofQueen Zyanyi Arkanand herKualtiduringA Kingdom Divided, development of Varlamore did not begin in earnest until at least 2022, whenMod Edrevealed that a pitch to develop the kingdom was in the works.[50]

After the release ofDesert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire, Varlamore was discovered to be included the world map with datamining tools, leading players to believe Varlamore was planned to be released in the near future. However, only the rough shape of the kingdom was visible; what little that has been mapped down were inspired from a number of player-made maps of Varlamore:

During theSummer Summit 2023, it was officially revealed that Varlamore is due to be released in early 2024, showing the first draft of the official map of Varlamore, which was made in collaboration with GentleTractor and commissioned by Jagex. Throughout the rest of the year, multiple blogs on specifics of the proposed content would be released to iron out the reward space.

The first part of Varlamore would be released on20 March2024, granting access toCivitas illa Fortis, theAvium Savannah, andRalos' Rise, as well as four new quests. TheColossal Wyrm Remainswere planned to have an agility training activity involved, but was delayed in order to ensure a timely release for the rest of part one.

The second part - titled "The Rising Darkness" - was released on the25 September2024. With it came the island ofAldarinand the rest of the mountain range north of Civitas illa Fortis, which includesthe Hueycoatlgroup boss, as well as four additional quests, one of which continued theTwilight Emissariesstoryline.

The third and final part - titled The Final Dawn - is slated for release in late spring 2025. It is planned to release a heavily-forested northern area of the kingdom which hosts a fletching activity, the Custodia Pass which serves as the connection to the rest of the continent and home to a new slayer dungeon, and theTlati Rainforestwhich comes with two new bosses:Osto-Ayak, a delve boss, and a low-intensity crab boss aimed at early to mid game players.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The two founding refugee groups of Varlamore, the Pericans and the Talkasti, seem to take inspiration from ancient Rome and various Mesoamerican civilizations. Perican names seem to be based on Latin while Talkasti names seem to be based on the Nahuatl language.Varlamore's geography and ecology are largely based on South and Central America. It shares several real world animals from that part of the world, such as thequetzalandcapybara. Their language is loosely based on Nahuatl, a Nahuan (Aztecan) language spoken in parts of central Mexico.IfChildren of the Sunwas completed prior to the release of Varlamore, a messenger will appear and give the player aVarlamore invitation. Now when a player completes the quest,Prince Itzla Arkanwill simply tell you how to access Varlamore himself while noting that you no longer require any invitation or permission.
