Walkthrough[edit|edit source]

Getting started[edit|edit source]

Talk toKing Bolrenin the centre of theTree Gnome Maze. He will say that three orbs have been stolen by Khazard troops. Agree to help him, and you will be escorted by Elkoy out of the maze.

The three trackers[edit|edit source]

North to themazeyou will find abattlefield. FindCommander Montaiand speak with him, he is wearing red clothing. He will ask for you to get 6logsto repair their defences. Supply him with the logs (if you didn't have logs or an axe simply return to a bank, or alternatively, you can kill thegoblinsin the maze for one. However, this will likely take longer than going to the bank). Talk toCommander Montaiagain, and he'll tell you that three trackers that have been sent out to retrieve coordinates to fire theballistahave not returned. He asks you to find them.

You can find all three tracker gnomes at the buildings north to thebattlefield. (look at the picture to the right to see the locations)

The first tracker is behind or on the side of the biggest building in the north-west.The second tracker is in the north-east building in a Khazard Prison Cell.The third tracker is roaming outside the south-west corner of the stronghold.

The first two trackers will give you the coordinates you need, which you'll automatically commit to memory. The third tracker, however, has been driven mad as a result of the chaos. Though most of what he says is garbage, he will give you a hint as to the number you need. You may have to do a bit of guesswork, though. For instance,"Less than my hands"would equal 1, where"More than my head less than my fingers"could be 2,"More than we but less than our feet"is 3, and lastly,"My legs and your legs"is 4. (It should not be any other possible number so try and remember what the third tracker said.)

Head back to theballista(not thecatapult, which is next to Montai), which is located in the south-west corner of the battlefield, here you want to choose the coordinate given from the third gnome tracker. If you miss, just try again until you get it.

The orbs[edit|edit source]

Once you get a hit, talk toCommander Montaionce again then walk north to the stronghold (building where Gnome Tracker 1 was) and climb over the crumbled wall.

Note:There is a stall after climbing the crumbled wall where you are attacked without being able to heal; as a low-levelled player, this may be dangerous.

Once you climb the wall you will be attacked by a level 48Khazard commander; they have lowHitpoints(22) and should not be troublesome for most mid-levelled players (can besafespottedbehind northern broken chair). You can skip defeating the commander if you wish and proceed to the western room and climb up the ladder.

When you climb theladderyou will once again be attacked by a level 48Khazard commander, kill him or head to the chest and  find theorb of protection. When you have the orb, run back down the ladder and out of the nearby door.

Go the north-west maze entrance and talk toElkoy, he will offer to lead you through the maze, accept his offer. push through the fence and talk toKing Bolren.

The Kingwill then tell you that the other twoorbs of protectionhave been stolen by theKhazard Warlord.

Items needed:Weapons, armour and decent food.

Tip:Consider if you want to fightthe warlordusing ranged or head on.

Exit the village and start heading north past the stronghold where you found the first orb. When you hit the wall toWest Ardougne, you want to go left and follow the wall until see twoKhazard troopersand the level 112Khazard warlord. Talk with him and he will challenge you to a fight and attack. Kill him to retrieve the other two orbs. Although he has a rather large health pool of 170 HP, he does not hit often if you are wearing decent armour. Players withRune armourand at least arune scimitarshould have little trouble fighting him if they have a small amount of decent qualityfood(lobsteror better). Magic or ranged can also be used easily by continuing to move outside the range he can walk to, or by setting up a safespot.

The warlord is also prone toflinching. By attacking him and walking west outside of his wander radius, he will stop attacking you once you have reached far enough west. If you use a Ranged or Magic attack here, the warlord will start running back east. If you run towards him and start attacking him again inside his wander radius, he will come back to you. Run west again before he is able to reach you, and repeat the process.Do not take too long killing the warlord, or he will despawn and you will be forced to restart the fight. He does not despawn when flinching around a tree.

Safespot ranged:To safespot the warlord, start the fight and head west until the warlord de-aggros near the larger dead tree. Move a little south and attack the warlord with Ranged or Magic while outside his aggro range. This will force the warlord to walk backwards at an angle and get caught against the West Ardougne wall and the northern large dead tree. If done correctly, players can attack the warlord safely as long as they keep distant enough as to not aggro the warlord again.

Safespot melee:Melee players can also safespot him by repeatedly stepping in and out of his walking range. One good spot is beside the large skull to the south.

After killing him, pick up theorbs of protection. Go back to King Bolren and hand over the orbs to him. A cutscene ensues, where the gnomes are seen celebrating and holding a ceremony in which the orbs are returned to their places on the sacred spirit tree.

Congratulations, quest complete!
