The area features:

3Yew trees4Maple trees3 Cage/HarpoonFishing spotsAccess to theCorsair Cove Dungeon

Using the resource area's fishing spot in conjunction with the deposit box outside the Corsair Cove bank can yield slightly faster trips (around 6 seconds there and back) over running from Karamja's lobster/swordfish spots to the boat then to Port Sarim deposit box. It will however drain more run energy due to there being no loading time while on the boat, but you will save on gold and have another inventory slot for fishing.

Corsair Cove Dungeon[edit|edit source]

There are two access points into the dungeon: through the hole west of cove and through the cave inside Haris's resource area. It is a useful location for both members and free players to fight level 82Ogress WarriorsandOgress Shamans, which are notable for therune full helm,limpwurt rootand theshaman maskdrops.
