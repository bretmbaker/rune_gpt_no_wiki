Delegation[edit|edit source]

Speak toNoahorAlinaat the eastern side ofVarrock Square, behindEliza's stall. Alina will tell you that a delegation from the Kingdom ofVarlamoreis on their way to Varrock after a long period of isolation. You may ask her various information about the kingdom, or ask when the delegation will arrive to immediately progress through the quest, which will begin a cutscene.

The delegation, seen approachingKing RoaldandAeonisig Raispher, comprises ofPrince Itzla Arkan,Servius, Teokan of Ralos,Furia Tullus,Ennius Tullus, and sixKnights of Varlamore. Meanwhile, a guard carrying a large bag is seen leaving the walls of theVarrock Palace. Though his superior,Sergeant Tobyn, lets him leave, you believe he looks a bit suspicious and decide to tail him.

Investigation[edit|edit source]

The guard will walk towards south-east Varrock and periodically turn around, where you will need to hide behind a building in order to avoid his sight. If you are caught, you will have to talk to Noah and start from the beginning again.

Use the image on the right andwalkaccordingly, standing on the indicated spots and resume walking once he's on the move again:

Run insideLowe's Archery Emporium.Hide behind the northern wall of the building south of the archery shop.Walk to the south-eastern corner of the building.Hide behind the western wall ofOld Man Yarlo's house.Hide either inside Old Man Yarlo's house or near the building south ofAubury's Rune Shop.

After hiding in the last spot, the suspicious guard will enter the small building just next toAubury's Rune Shopand a cutscene will automatically begin, detailing how the guard was actually a member of somebandits, and how they plan to attack the delegation as they leave.

After the cutscene, go back to Varrock Square and speak toSergeant Tobyn. He will instruct the player to identify the four bandits posing as guards. Do so by clicking the "Mark" option on them:

The first guard can be found directly outsideAris's tent. He is standing with his hands on his hips with no weapon.The second guard is found nearBennyand his news stand. She is not wearing a helmet.The third guard can be found directly outsideLowe's Archery Emporiumon the east path. He is leaning on the wall with his arms crossed, without a weapon.The fourth guard can be found further along the east path between the archery shop andVarrock east bank. He wields a mace instead of a sword.

Interrogation[edit|edit source]

Return toSergeant Tobyn, who will promptly arrest the bandits off-screen. You will be taken to the cell on the palace roof to assist with the interrogations. Unexpectedly,Prince Itzlawill appear; having been bored by the politics and hearing a bit of commotion, he decides to come to the roof. He will introduce himself to you and decide to assist you with the interrogations.

A cutscene will play where Prince Itzla interrogates one of the bandits, with you providing a little help. The bandit quickly gives in and informs him that they were approached by someone unknown, possibly from Varlamore, to killServius, Teokan of Ralos.

After the interrogation, Prince Itzla will thank you for your role in stopping the assassination attempt by giving you special permission to visitVarlamoreand asks you to speak withRegulus Centooutside the Eastern gate of Varrock when you're ready to travel to Varlamore and help continue the investigation on the assassination attempt.
