Port Tyrasis a port west of theTyras Camp. Port Tyras was likely built as part ofKing Tyras' invasion of the forest ofIsafdar, though it has no buildings and the only notable feature is a pier with a charter ship docked at it, and severalTyras guardspositioned there.

Charter ship[edit|edit source]

Regicidemust be completed before chartering to Port Tyras. Players who reach the port during the quest can still charter out of it, however full completion is needed to travel back to it.

Thecharter shipshave a dock in the harbour in Port Tyras. It provides rides to several other locations. This is the fastest way to get to Tyras Camp other than walking through the dangerous elven forest. Some players may also find this helpful in getting toLletyaif they have lost theirteleport crystaland do not want to go through theUnderground passorArandargate.

After completingCabin Fever, the charter ship fare is reduced by 50%. Wearing thering of charos(a)also reduces the fare by 50%. These two bonuses can be stacked to reduce the cost to 25%.
