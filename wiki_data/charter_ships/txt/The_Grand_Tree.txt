Take both these items toHazelmere. He can be found on a small island east ofYanille. There arejungle spiders(level 44) on the way to his house, although they are notpoisonous. There are several ways to reach him easily:

Hazelmere[edit|edit source]

Talk toHazelmere. You cannot understand his language and vice versa, but you can communicate with the help of sign language regardless. He will take yourbark sample, and after examining it, he will give you amessage. When translated using thetranslation bookit reads

“ | A man came to me with the King's seal.I gave the manDaconia rocks.And Daconia rocks will kill the tree! | ”

Return to King Narnode in theGrand Tree, and tell him the message above. He will ask what the translation is in three lines, so pick each line from the choices offered. If none of the options match, select the"None of the above"option until the correct option presents itself. For the first line, you have to go to the third set of choices offered. He will explain that someone used his seal to haveHazelmeregive awayDaconia rocks, which were made as a "fail-safe" and can kill the tree. He will direct you to talk toGlough, his head tree guardian.

Glough is located south of theGrand Tree, east of the ramp, in a tree house. He will tell you that he will take care of the problem.

Investigation[edit|edit source]

Tip:If you have completed theTree Gnome Villagequest, you can use aSpirit treeas teleportation. bring with you runes to teleport toVarrockand use thespirit treeat theGrand Exchange, This will come in handy.

Return toKing Narnode Shareen. He will tell you thatGloughhas caught and imprisoned a human, who was found carrying theDaconia rocks. Ask to see the prisoner. Talk toKing Narnode Shareenagain, and he will tell you that the prisoner is located on the top floor of theGrand Tree.

The prisoner, whose name isCharlie, will tell you that he hadHazelmeregive the Daconia rocks to him, though he was only doing asGloughasked him to do. He tells you to search Glough's house for evidence. Go to Glough's house. Search thecupboard, and you will find his journal. Talk to Glough, who then orders the guards at you. After the conversation, you will be put in the cell next to Charlie's. Talk to Charlie, he will tell you about theShip YardonKaramja, and give you the password to access it, which isKa-Lu-Min.

The kingwill appear and apologise for Glough imprisoning you. He will tell you that guards are watching the entrances, and tells you to quickly escape on theGnome glideron the top floor of theGrand Tree, next to the cells. Talk to the pilot. He will ask you where you want to go and you will ask him to fly you toKaramja.

Karamja[edit|edit source]

The glider will crash land just west of the Ship Yard. Run east past the level 53jogres, they could attack you(so be wary of this if you're a low level). Once you reach the Ship Yard attempt to open the gate. Ashipyard workerwill stop you. Tell him Glough sent you. He will ask for a password (Charlie told you it is):Ka-Lu-Min. After confirming the correct password he'll let you open the gate.

Go out to the southern docks and you'll find theforeman. Once you find him you have two choices. You kill him (he is a level 23), or you talk to him. Both will result in you getting proof of Glough's plans.

If you choose to talk. Tell him Glough sent you. He will then take you somewhere private. You'll need to answer some personal questions about Glough.

He will ask how his wife is, select "Sadly his wife is no longer with us".
He will then ask what his favourite dish is, select "Worm holes".
Finally, he will ask for his new girlfriend's name, which is "Anita".

Once you've made your choice and you've got thelumber order, return toThe Grand Tree. If you have completed theTree Gnome Villagequest, either Teleport toVarrockand use thespirit treeat theGrand Exchange, or useArdougne cloak 1or higher and run northwest to the spirit tree to teleport you toGnome stronghold.

If you haven't completed theTree Gnome Villagequest then make your way to theTree Gnome Strongholdfront gateand talk toFemi. Tell her you need to get inside, and she will sneak you in. If you haven't helped her previously, she will charge you 1,000 coins. If you have, she will help you for free.

Tuzo[edit|edit source]

After you showthe kingthenotefrom theforeman, he still will not believe your accusations, call you as paranoid asGlough, and ask you to leave for your own safety.

Speak toCharlieagain on the top floor of theGrand Tree. He will suggest you speak toAnita, Glough's girlfriend. Go and talk to her. She is in the second house west to the swamp, you have to go upstairs. She will give you akeyand ask you to return it to Glough.

Go to Glough's house, and use the key to open the chest. Inside, you will find some of hisnotesdetailing his plan to seize control ofGielinor. After you pick them up they are called "Invasion plans" in your inventory. Click "Continue" otherwise you won't get the notes.

Note:You must have at least 4 free inventory space before you do the next step.

Take the notes to King Shareen. He will still not believe your evidence. He will tell you that in their search of Glough's house all they found were four bundles oftwigs. They spell out the wordTUZO. Using theTranslation book, this translates to "open." The King will give you all four bundles of twigs.

Return to Glough's house, and climb up the watchtower. This tree is located on the east side of the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]and requires 25Agilityto climb. Up in the watchtower, you will find a stone stand and four pillars. Use the twigs with the four pillars to spell outTUZO, starting from the far left. After you have placed the twigs on the four pillars, you will hear gears turning. You can now open the trap door on this platform,but do not go in yet unless you are prepared for the fight.

Encountering the Black demon[edit|edit source]

After you enter the trapdoor,Gloughwill come and talk to you, threatening you with his plans to wipe out humans.

After the conversation concludes, a level 172black demonwill appear to the west and attack you.

It can be fought with any combat style, but can besafespottedwithRanged,Magicor ahalberd. To safespot, stand where Glough is during the fight, if the black demon can still attack you, move back behind another rock until he can no longer attack you. You can also go into the tunnel to the west to where the demon cannot reach and safely attack him using ranged or magical attacks. He can also be safespotted by standing north of the ladder. The Black Demon has very low magic and negative magic defence bonus, and has a 40%weaknessto water spells; as such, it's recommended for low level players should use the highest tier water spell they can use and afford.

Safespot 1: The recommended safespot located directly north of the entrance ladder.Safespot 2: The safespot where Glough stands. Not recommended for lowHitpointsorHardcore Ironmen.Safespot 3: Alternative safespot, run past the demon into the tunnel where it spawned. Only works withRangedorMagic. It will get at least one attack on the player.

The adamant king[edit|edit source]

After defeating the demon, walk along the passage until you findKing Shareenstanding by a ladder. Talk to him and tell him that Glough had sent a demon to attack you, but he will not believe you. He finally sends a guard to scout for Glough, to which the guard comes back with Glough, who was hiding amongst the stones. The king apologises, and asks you to locate the lastDaconia rock.

Note:You will need one empty space in your inventory for the next part.

Search therootsall around the area until you find the Daconia rock. Though it can be time-consuming, you might need to search all of the roots. If you somehow lose the rock, it'll spawn in the root where you first found it.

When the dialogue pops up stating that you found the stone, click continue or it won't appear in your inventory. After obtaining the rock, talk to King Shareen again for your reward for saving the Grand Tree.

Congratulations, quest complete!
