| Ectophial teleport

A player empties an ectophial to activate its teleportation.

Theectophialis a reward for completing theGhosts Ahoyquest. Players can empty it, causing them to be teleported to theEctofuntusoutsidePort Phasmatys. Once the player teleports, they will automatically refill it. The player cannot interrupt the refilling animation themselves, and is immune to damage for the duration; onPvP worlds, an attacker will still gain experience on a successful hit, but no damage will be dealt. This makes the ectophial basically an unlimited teleport to the Ectofuntus.

If the player loses the ectophial, they can get a replacement fromVelorinain Port Phasmatys (must wear aghostspeak amuletorMorytania legs 2or better) or purchase it fromPerdufor 4,600 coins. Claiming a replacement from Velorina will give the player a full ectophial. Claiming an ectophial from Velorina if the player already has one will give an empty one instead, which the player first has to fill at the Ectofuntus before they can use it.

It can be used to quickly escape from fights because it is easy to replace, costs nothing, and is a one click teleport from your inventory.

Like most teleport items, the ectophial does not work past level 20 Wilderness.
