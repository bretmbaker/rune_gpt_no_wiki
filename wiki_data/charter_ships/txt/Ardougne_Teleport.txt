Ardougne Teleportteleports the caster toEast Ardougnemarket. This spell can only be cast after reading theArdougne teleport scroll, which is a quest completion reward from thePlague Cityquest. Once the player reads the scroll they will memorise the spell Ardougne Teleport and the scroll will crumble to dust. If a player loses this scroll, they can go back toEdmondin north-west of East Ardougne to get a new one. Casting the spell is a requirement for theMedium Ardougne Diary.
