[Weapon: Bronze Bolts#Poison++]


Bronze boltsare the weakestbolts, and may be shot from anycrossbow.
Bronze bolts are crossbow bolts made out ofbronze. To make them, a player must smithunfinished bronze bolts. This requires aSmithinglevel of 3, and for eachbronze barthat player smiths they will get 10 unfinished bronze bolts and 12 Smithingexperience. Then a player must attach flights to the bolts. Attaching flights to each bolt requires aFletchinglevel of 9 and 1feather, granting 0.5 Fletching experience per bolt. They may also be stolen from the crossbow stall inKeldagrim. As with mostbolts, they can bepoisoned, however this will prevent the addition ofbolt tips.
