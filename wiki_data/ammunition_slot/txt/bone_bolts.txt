[Weapon: Bone Bolts]


Bone boltsare ammunition that can be bought after completion ofThe Lost Tribequest. They can only be used with theDorgeshuun crossbow, a popular choice for training ranged due to its faster speed than regular crossbows. Unlike other ammunition, it requires 28Rangedto equip.
Due to their low price and ease of access fromNardok's Bone Weapons, having a base price of only 3 coins each, bone bolts are generally considered a very cost effective method of trainingRangedat lower levels. In order to save costs, buyingbone bolt packsis recommended, since the cost per bolt can rapidly increase when buying the bolts individually. As with other bolts, theirranged strengthis higher than mostarrowswith similar level requirements. TheDorgeshuun crossbowis 1tick(0.6 seconds) slower to fire thanshortbows, which balances out the higher strength of the bolts.
