[Weapon: Training Arrows]


Training arrowsare arrows given by theRanged combat tutorthat can only be fired using aTraining bow. The combat stats of the arrows are equivalent toBronze arrowsbut are less used due to the fact that they can only be fired by aTraining bow.
Training arrows can be obtained from theRanged combat tutoreast of theLumbridge Castle, along with a bow. Although technically the players cannot claim more than 25, arrows on the ground are not counted towards that limit. This means that a player can shoot the arrows without picking them up, claim extra 25 arrows, and then pick up the fired ones from the ground, obtaining more than 25 in total.
