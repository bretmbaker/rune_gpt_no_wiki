[Weapon: Diamond Bolts (E)]


Diamond bolts (e)areadamant boltstipped with enchanteddiamond.Diamond boltscan be enchanted by using the spellEnchant Crossbow Bolt (Diamond)by a player with 57Magic. The spell enchants 10 diamond bolts per cast and uses 2law runes, 1cosmic rune, and 10earth runes.
Diamond bolts (e) have a 10% chance (5% chance against another player) of triggering theArmour Piercingeffect. This increases the maximum damage by 15% (26% when under the effect of theZaryte crossbow) for that hit and guarantees it will be asuccessful hit.[1][2][3][4][5]The maximum hit is calculated based on current ranged level, so if your ranged level is reduced (e.g. by brewing down) your max hit will go down too. A twinkling sound can be heard when this activates.
