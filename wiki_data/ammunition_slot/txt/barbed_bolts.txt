[Weapon: Barbed Bolts]


Barbed boltsarebronze boltswith barbed tips. Barbed bolts can be created through theFletchingskill at level 51, simply by usingbarb bolttipswith bronze bolts. 30 barbed bolt tips can be obtained from theRanging Guild Ticket Exchangein theRanging Guildin exchange for 140archery tickets. For each barbed bolt tip attached to a bronze bolt, a player is granted 9.5 Fletchingexperience.
Barbed bolts can be shot from any standard crossbow, including theregularorPhoenix crossbow, so they may be used at level 1Rangedas a superior version ofbronze bolts. However, they both do less damage and are more expensive thanopal bolts (e), so their usage is inadvised. Additionally,Ironmenrequire level 40 Ranged to enter the guild and buy the bolt tips, at which point much stronger weapons are available.
