[Weapon: Diamond Dragon Bolts (E)]


Diamond dragon bolts (e)arediamond dragon boltsthat are enchanted via theEnchant Crossbow Bolt (Diamond)spell by a player with 57Magic. The spell enchants 10 bolts per cast, and uses 2law runes, 1cosmic rune, and 10earth runes. These bolts can only be used with aDragon crossbowor better.
Enchanted diamond dragon bolts have a 10% chance (5% chance against another player) of triggering theArmour Piercingeffect. This increases the maximum damage by 15% (26% when under the effect of theZaryte crossbow) for that hit as well as becoming asuccessful hit.[1][2][3][4][5]Not only is your range accuracy ignored when the spec activates, so is your range level, so if your stats are reduced (e.g. by brewing down), you will still roll with guaranteed accuracy and 0-115% of your usual max hit.[6]A tinkling sound can be heard when this activates.
