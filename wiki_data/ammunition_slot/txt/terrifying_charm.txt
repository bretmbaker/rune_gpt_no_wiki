Theterrifying charmis anitemmade by combining thebruised banana,old wool,smelly sock, andspooky egg, all of which can be found by rummaging through thespooky cauldron. When the player makes one, a game message in the chatbox statesYou combine the questionable items together to create something that could scare Death himself!
When equipped during the2022or2023 Halloween events, "trick-or-treating" NPCs will always result in the player receiving five treats. However, the terrifying charm is destroyed after three uses. With the end of the event, players can still assemble terrifying charms, though they have no use, nor do they stack in a bank.
As this is an ammunition slot item, it is not visible on the player model when equipped.
