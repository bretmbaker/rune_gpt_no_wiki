[Weapon: Rune Brutal]


Rune brutal arrowsare used to killZogres(located south ofCastle Wars) orChompy birds. They are made by combiningflighted ogre arrowsandrune nails. Players can make these arrows with level 77Fletching. Each arrow grants 12.5 experience.
Like all brutal arrows, these arrows can only be fired from aComposite ogre bow, but are more powerful than regularrune arrows. If you try to use them with an ordinary Ogre Bow it will say that the bow isn't powerful enough to use these arrows. Players will often use them against Zogres because they are extremely effective against them.
