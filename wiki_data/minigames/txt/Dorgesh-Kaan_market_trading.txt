Dorgesh-Kaan market tradingis an activity that can be played at the market ofDorgesh-Kaan. It revolves around selling "exotic" surface foods toDorgeshuungourmetsfor a certain price, with some foods being more or less desired than others. If executed well, a significant amount of money may be earned this way. Completion ofDeath to the Dorgeshuunis required to access the market.

Starting out[edit|edit source]

Before being able to sell foods, you will need to get permission first. This is done by speaking toLurgon, owner ofDorgesh-Kaan General Supplies- he can be found wandering around the middle of the market. He will explain the basics of trading and inform you that you will need permission from theDorgeshuun Councilfirst, with a certain (random) councillor in charge of the marketplace. Find this councillor and ask for permission, which you are granted instantly. Return to Lurgon - you will now be able to sell food to the goblins. This permission is only valid on thegame worldit was earned on. Attempting to start the minigame on another world will require permission to be earned on that world, removing your permission from the previous world.

Overview[edit|edit source]

As a result of the established connection to the surface, many goblins have developed a craving for exotic human food. There are four differently dressedgourmetswandering around the market, to whom you are able sell your food. Simply use a piece of food on them and name your price. If your price is too high, however, the gourmet will not buy anything since the food will be too expensive for them; likewise, if the price is too low, the goblin will think the food is of poor quality and not buy it either. If the gourmet agrees with the price, they will offer to buy a certain amount of food (usually up to five pieces depending on whether the price was on the low or high end) and you may agree to sell or decline. If you don't have the amount of food the gourmet desires, you may still sell what you have. Moreover, it is not required to stick with the gourmet's wish - you may sell less if you want to. After completing a transaction with one of the gourmets, you must trade with a different one next - the gourmets will not want to buy from you twice in a row.

Offering a suitable price is tricky. You may use the food on Lurgon to get a rough estimate of the price that the food goes for, along with some advice (see the last section for these prices). This price is usually higher than itshigh level alchemyvalue, but it depends on popularity as well. You may deviate from the suggested price, but not too much. As a rule of thumb, the foods will generally sell best for slightly above Lurgon's price if the gourmet liked its look or smell.

After a successful trade, a grateful gourmet may also give you some Dorgeshuun food for free. This will be one out ofmushrooms,fillets,loach,roast frog,eel sushiorgrubs à la mode.

Gourmet's reaction[edit|edit source]

When determining your price, the gourmet's reaction to the food must be taken into account as well. If they react positively, they will be willing to pay more. However, if they don't like the look of the food, they will not pay as much and it may be a good idea to try selling to a different gourmet, preferably the one with the most positive response. Additionally, it's important to sell a variety of food types; the novelty of all foods quickly wears off, causing the gourmets to pay less if offered the same type of food repeatedly. However, this discount due to repeated selling is only about 0.7% of the price, and can nearly be ignored.

Gourmet's response | Reaction | Multiplier

Yuck, that looks horrid. What is it? | Very negative | 1

Eww, what's that? | Negative | 1.5

So what's that then? | Neutral | 2

That smells nice; what is it? | Positive | 2.5

Mmm, that smells good... What is it? | Very positive | 3

Making an offer[edit|edit source]

To determine the price that a Gourmet is willing to pay, find the price of the item (by talking to Lurgon or consulting the table below). Then, multiply this price by the multiplier.

For example, when offering aManta rayto a Gourmet that had a "positive" response, that Gourmet will "value" it at 2.5 times the Dorgeshuun value (100 x 2.5 = 250).

If you were to offer to sell the manta ray for ≤ 45% (250 x 0.45 - 1), the Gourmet would offer to buy two of them.

Gourmet's response | Price range (% of value)

Hmm...if you're selling them that cheaply there must be something wrong with them. I think I'll pass. | ≤ 10% (won't buy)

That sounds like a great deal to me. I'll take five! | ≤ 25%

That sounds like a great deal to me. I'll take four! | ≤ 35%

That sounds like a good deal to me. I'll take three! | ≤ 40%

That sounds like a good deal to me. I'll take two! | ≤ 45%

That's fair. I'll take one. | ≤ 50%

Hmm, okay. I'll buy one. | ≤ 60%

That's a bit much for me. | ≤ 100%

Don't be absurd - it's clearly not worth that! | no limit (won't buy)

Goodness! We don't deal in sums of money that big in the marketplace. | no limit (won't buy, > 5000 coins)

The trick is to find a balance between a high price and the gourmet's willingness to buy more pieces. Sometimes, lowering the price a bit may lead to greater profits since the gourmet will want to buy more. It's always handy to bring several pieces of the foods you are trying to sell.

Overselling[edit|edit source]

If you sell too many of the same item, over time, the Gourmets will start to offer less money for it. The discount is 1% multiplied by how many of the item you've sold, but this count decrements by one every minute. It is world-specific and true for all players. The discount is capped at 50%, meaning the Gourmets will always pay at least half of the normal price, even if you've sold thousands. You can get a sense of whether the Gourmets are tired of a particular food based on their dialogue response:

Count | Response

0 | Ooh, I've never had that before. How exciting!

1-10 | Oh, I think I've heard people talking about that.

11-20 | Oh, of course. I've had that occasionally.

21-40 | Oh, we have that all the time.

40+ | That again?

If a gourmet has never had a food before, there is a 1% chance that they'll be amazed by the food, and tell all their friends about it. This means that the gourmets will treat this food as "Very positive" for the next 20 minutes, meaning you can charge more money for it.
