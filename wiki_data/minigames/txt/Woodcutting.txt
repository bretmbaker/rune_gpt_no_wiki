Woodcuttingis a gatheringskillthat primarily involves chopping trees to obtain logs used in theFletching,Firemaking, andConstructionskills. Players with a higher Woodcutting level can chop down new types of trees and cut down trees quicker, especially as higher levels ofaxesbecome available.

Woodcutting is a useful skill for a low-levelled player to make money early in the game. On the map, locations of rare trees can be located with a treeicon.

Players looking for a more social Woodcutting experience can partake inForestry. To begin, grab aForestry kitfrom theForestry ShopinDraynor,Seers' VillageorPrifddinas.

Memberscan also grow their own trees to chop using theFarmingskill. Additionally, at level 60 Woodcutting and above (which can be boosted), members can gain access to theWoodcutting Guild, containing a wide variety of useful features.

Mechanics[edit|edit source]

Both Woodcutting level and tier of axe determines players' speed of chopping logs. Players with high enoughAttacklevels can equip the axes that match the respective metals, but having an axe equipped is not necessary in order to chop a tree; having one in the player's inventory also works.

Most trees follow the same mechanics when cut, rolling to chop a log every 4 gameticks. All trees have different chances to chop a log depending on the tree being cut, the player's Woodcutting level, and the axe being used. With a high Woodcutting level and a good axe, a 100% success rate can be achieved when cutting certain lower-level trees.[2]

Trees despawn on a timer that activates after the first cut and regenerates if players stop cutting the tree before it is fully chopped. The regeneration rate is equal to the chopping time. So chopping for 10 seconds, then stopping for 10 seconds will let the tree recover to full. After a tree depletes, a timer counts down to its respawn.

Tree | Despawn time | Respawn time

Oak tree | 27 seconds | 8.4 seconds

Willow tree | 30 seconds | 8.4 seconds

Teak tree | 30 seconds | 9 seconds

Maple tree | 1 minute | 35.4 seconds

Hollow tree | 36 seconds | 25.8 seconds

Mahogany tree | 1 minute | 8.4 seconds

Arctic pine tree | 1 minute, 24 seconds | 8.4 seconds

Yew tree | 1 minute, 54 seconds | 59.4 seconds

Magic tree | 3 minutes, 54 seconds | 1 minute, 59.4 seconds

Redwood tree | 4 minutes, 24 seconds | 1 minute, 59.4 seconds

Members have a chance to receive thebeaverWoodcutting pet whilst chopping trees aroundGielinor.

Bird Nests[edit|edit source]

Whilst chopping most standard trees, players have a 1/256 chance to receivebird nests, which fall to the floor and can be picked up. These may be empty, or contain various rings, tree seeds, and rarely abird's egg. The nests themselves are valuable in theircrushed formfor use in makingSaradomin Brewswith theHerbloreskill.

The player may also obtainclue nestsin a similar fashion, which contain aclue scrollbetween beginner and elite tiers. Whilst regular bird nests aren't obtainable through chopping redwood trees, clue nests are. Unlike normal nests, these rates are affected by the type of tree and Woodcutting level.

Special Woodcutting locations and activities[edit|edit source]

Several locations have unique mechanics that related to Woodcutting.

Woodcutting Guild[edit|edit source]

TheWoodcutting guildis located in the south-western corner ofHosidius, providing various Woodcutting features formembers. The guild requires at least level 60 Woodcutting to enter. Within the guild, players receive aninvisible +7 boostto their Woodcutting skill, allowing them to chop trees significantly faster, but not trees that require a Woodcutting level above their visible level.

The guild contains a wide variety of trees found acrossGielinor, including higher levelyewandmagic trees; all found in close proximity to both asawmillandbank. It is the only location ofredwood treesin the game, except for those grown by the player within theFarming guild. Other notable features include:

Perry's Chop-chop Shop, the only shop inOld School RuneScapethat sellsrune axes.A dungeon containing manyEnts

Forestry[edit|edit source]

Forestryis a social Woodcutting activity in which players carry aForestry kitfor a chance to spawn special events upon felling trees. These special events can spawn more frequently when players are either cutting the same tree, cutting higher-tiered trees, or by doing both. Eligible players can earnanima-infused bark, various types ofleaves, and other rare event items. The anima-infused bark can then be exchanged atForestry shopsfor a variety of Woodcutting-related items.

Canoes[edit|edit source]

Canoesare a way of travelling along theRiver Lum. All that is required to use them is anaxeand a minimum of level 12 Woodcutting for the lowest level canoe. There are five canoe stations and six stops.

Canoes are a very handy way of getting toEdgevillewithout anamulet of glory.

Whilst theWildernessis the last stop, there are no suitable trees to make a canoe, so it is a one-way trip. It drops players off just north of theblack chinchompahunting grounds.

Image | Canoe | Woodcutting | Notes

Level | Exp

 | A Log | 12 | 30 | It will take you one stop along the River Lum. Cannot be used to travel to the Wilderness.

 | A Dugout | 27 | 60 | It can take you up to two stops along the River Lum. Cannot be used to travel to the Wilderness.

 | A Stable Dugout | 42 | 90 | It can take you up to three stops along the River Lum. Cannot be used to travel to the Wilderness.

 | A Waka | 57 | 150 | It can take you unlimited stops along the River Lum. The only canoe that can travel into the Wilderness.

Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup[edit|edit source]

Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup is a Woodcutting minigame that revolves around hacking jungle bushes aroundTai Bwo Wannaiwith a machete forthatch sparsand using them to repair the village fence. Both actions grant favour with the locals, which can be exchanged fortrading sticks. Furthermore,gout tubers,proboscides,snake hide,uncut opals,uncut jades,uncut red topazesandtribal masksmay be obtained from creatures and rocks that occasionally spawn upon successfully clearing a jungle bush.

Prifddinas[edit|edit source]

Theregular trees,teak tree,mahogany trees,yew treesandmagic treesfound within the walls of Prifddinas have a 1/40 chance of producing acrystal shardin addition to the main product. Despite their models also having embedded crystals, the trees inGwenithdo not yield crystal shards.

Ents[edit|edit source]

Ents are monsters found in theWildernessand at theWoodcutting guild. They become ent trunks when killed, which can be chopped for randomnotedlogs until it despawns. Ents in the wilderness produce logs at twice the rate of logs from ents at the Woodcutting Guild. Completing the medium tier of theWilderness Diaryfurther increases the rate.

Farmable trees[edit|edit source]

Oak trees, willow trees, maple trees, yew trees, and magic trees can be planted in any of sixtree patchesfound throughout Gielinor. Teak trees and mahogany trees can be planted in any of threehardwood patchesonFossil Island.Crystal treescan be planted in thecrystal tree patchinPrifddinas.Celastrus treescan be planted in the dedicatedcelastrus patchand redwood trees in the dedicatedredwood tree patch, both found in the advanced tier of theFarming Guild. Crystal trees and celastrus do not grant Woodcutting experience when chopped.

Farmable trees offer the benefit of being visible only to the player who has planted it, thus removing competition. Attempting to chop a tree in a Farming patch causes the player to stall for onetick, which allows for1.5-tick woodcutting.

Obstacles[edit|edit source]

Several obstacles can be traversed by chopping them with an axe or machete. These include:

Jungle bushesandjungle treesblocking the entrance to theKharazi jungle. In addition to being crossed when chopped, they yieldlogs.Dead treesfound north of theShining Poolblock theKendal's cave. Only two of the trees can be chopped, the others produce the message "There is nothing to gain from chopping down this tree". These grant no logs and no experience.Tendrilsblocking access to the inner ring of theAbyss.Thick vinesblocking various pathways in theTar Swamp. They grant 2 experience when chopped.Vinesblocking certain passageways in theBrimhaven Dungeon. They grant no experience when chopped.

Other[edit|edit source]

Themaplesfound onMiscellaniacan only be chopped after getting to a certain point duringThrone of Miscellania. The player won't receive any logs upon cutting these specific trees, instead the kingdom keeps them, and grants you some favour in gratitude for woodcutting for them. Similarly, theteak treesandmahogany treesfound onEtceteriacan only be chopped afterRoyal Troublehas been completed, immediately granting the logs to the kingdom and earning some favour as a player. Theevergreen treesfound on both islands are not considered part of the kingdom, thus behave normally.After completion of the medium tier of theKandarin Diary, the maples inSeers' Villagegrant 10% extra experience.Fruit trees planted infruit tree patchescan be chopped down at any level, granting no experience.TheWoodcutting stumpinNeitiznotcan be used to makesplit logsandNeitiznot shieldsfromarctic pine logs, the former granting 5 Woodcutting experience.

Woodcutting pet[edit|edit source]

Thebeaveris a skillingpetthat can be obtained whilst training Woodcutting. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Woodcutting level and the time it takes to gather a resource. Choppingenttrunks andbruma rootswill notgive players a chance to receive this pet.
