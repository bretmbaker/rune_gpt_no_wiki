TzTok-Jad, commonly calledJadfor short, is one of thestrongest monstersinOld School RuneScapeand the boss of theTzHaar Fight Caveminigame. With acombat levelof 702, TzTok-Jad has a max hit of 97 and can easily kill most players in one hit with any of its three attacks: aMeleeattack with its bite (max hit of 97), a blast ofMagicin the form of a fireball (max hit of 95), and a boulder falling from the ceiling as aRangedattack (max hit of 97). To add to the challenge, players must fight through waves of monsters in the TzHaar Fight Cave in order to reach TzTok-Jad and must do so solo and without being able to restock on supplies from the previous waves.

Slayer[edit|edit source]

Players can pay 100slayer reward pointsto haveDuradel,Nieve, orChaeldarassignTzHaaras a possibleSlayer task. When players receive TzHaar as a slayer assignment, they will be prompted with an option to be assigned 1-3 TzTok-Jad instead. By default, players can only kill one Jad per task, but can be increased to 2 and 3 respectively with completion of theMasterandGrandmaster Combat Achievementsrespectively.

This gives players the option to use theirimbued black mask/slayer helm's damage and accuracy bonuses on all monsters encountered in the Fight Cave. Players who accept this challenge will receiveSlayerexperiencefor each of the monsters in the Fight Cave that they defeat, as well as 25,250 Slayer experience should they defeat TzTok-Jad himself, totalling 37,010 experience for the entire cave.

If the player is to leave the Fight Cave during their task, either manually or by dying, they will receive the following message:You no longer have a slayer task as you left the fight cave.This willnotreset a player's task streak, and can be used as a way to quickly skip the task without the use of slayer points.

Fighting TzTok-Jad[edit|edit source]

TzTok-Jad is the boss monster of the TzHaar Fight Cave, and is encountered on Wave 63 (the final wave). This is the only place where Jad can be found.

Once TzTok-Jad is reached, fighting and defeating him requires decent skill and reflexes. It is possible to engage TzTok-Jad usingMelee, but as TzTok-Jad's melee attack has no warning animation, players must have protect from melee active when in melee distance, and switch to Protect from Missiles or Protect from Magic once the respective warning animation is identified. When at a distance, TzTok-Jad only uses Ranged and Magic attacks, which can hit the player from up to 15 tiles away. While Jad has no defence bonuses, it is recommended to kill Jad with ranged, as it avoids the melee attack completely, only leaving the magic and ranged attacks for Jad.

As with all other off-colored monsters in the Fight Caves, locating where the orangeKet-Zekspawned will indicate Jad's spawn point. Like theTok-Xil, Jad has a very long attack range, and players not using drawn out clients can find themselves being attacked by Jad without seeing the combat style he uses and where he comes from.

Like Ket-Zek, Jad's attacks can deal extremely high damage, and is even capable of killing lower-leveled players in one hit if not protected against. Jad's melee and ranged attacks have a max hit of 97, while the magic attack has a max hit of 95.

Melee:TzTok-Jad thrusts forward with a sharp bite. He only does this if the player is within melee distance. Unlike the Magic and Ranged attacks, the Melee attack is instant.Magic:TzTok-Jad rears up on his hind legs and dangles his forward legs for a few seconds before launching a fireball from his mouth at the player.Ranged:TzTok-Jad rears up on his hind legs, then slams down his front legs onto the ground causing a boulder to fall on the player (it is not possible to evade this boulder by running).

Once TzTok-Jad is reduced to below 150 health, he will summon fourYt-HurKotsto come and heal him repeatedly — the player must deal with them whilst warding off TzTok-Jad's attacks.If they manage to heal him to full health, then theyshould not be killedas the healers that have died will respawn once he is reduced to half health again. If they are distracted before healing him to full health, theywill not respawnwhen killed.

You can practice fighting Jad by logging into a speed running world and set up a speed run forBeneath Cursed Sands. Because you have a fire cape there, you can do the first one ofTzHaar-Ket-Rak's Challengesand fightJalTok-Jad, which is a stronger variant of Jad. Here, the healers have higher stats, but their mechanics are more forgiving - needing to be untagged and directly next to Jad in order to heal.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Once players manage to defeat TzTok-Jad, they will be rewarded with the covetedfire capealong with 8,032Tokkul(16,064 Tokkul with completion of theElite Karamja Diary).

Players may exchange any unwanted fire capes withTzHaar-Mej-Jalfor their choice of 8,000 Tokkul or a second chance atTzrek-jad, having the same reward rate as killing Jad without aSlayertask (1/200).

When killing Jad and exchanging the cape, you increase your effective chance to ~1/101 to receive the pet (~1/67 on slayer task).
