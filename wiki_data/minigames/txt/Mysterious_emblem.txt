Amysterious emblemwas an item that was purchasable from theEmblem Trader, which a player could upgrade by killing the player's assigned target on the officialBounty Hunterworld whilst having a mysterious emblem in their inventory. However, their opponent must also have had a mysterious emblem of the same tier in order for it to be upgraded. If a player is holding multiple emblems, only the highest tier emblem will be upgraded.

Emblems werealways lostupon death; players were willing to risk their emblem to either receive an emblem in another player's possession or to upgrade their own. For example, if a player was killed and had a tier 4 emblem in theirinventory, the target's emblem will be destroyed upon death, and the victor's emblem would have been upgraded to tier 5.

Players were not able to drop Mysterious emblems. Unlike most items, mysterious emblems had a seven second timer before being destroyed, in order to prevent players from destroying them mid-combat to deny their killer the emblem as loot.

Tiers[edit|edit source]

There were five tiers of emblem with increasing values. Once a mysterious emblem was purchased, players were able to upgrade the emblem or sell it back to theEmblem Traderfor the same amount of coins. Players couldn't buy a tier 5 emblem; they were obtainable only by upgrading a tier 4 emblem.

The price of a mysterious emblem depended on its tier:

Emblem | Buy price | Sell price

 | Tier 1 | 75,000 | 75,000

 | Tier 2 | 150,000 | 150,000

 | Tier 3 | 300,000 | 300,000

 | Tier 4 | 600,000 | 600,000

 | Tier 5 | N/A | 1,200,000
