Keldagrim tasksare smallquest-like tasks assigned only inKeldagrim, the capital of the dwarven realm.

To begin the tasks, players must speak to variousdwarvesin Keldagrim. Certain shopkeepers will often ask the player to retrieve items for them. For the most part these correspond to the dwarf's job. For instance,Agmundi, the owner ofAgmundi Quality Clothes, will ask for items such asthread.

The player will have 10–25 minutes to retrieve the items. If the player brings the items to the dwarf in time, they will usually get to choose their reward: either a few hundred or thousandcoinsor 150-500 experience in a certainskill(s). The experience corresponds to the items retrieved, meaning that players can receive eitherAttack,Crafting,Defence,Mining, orSmithingexperience depending on the task.

Task-givers[edit|edit source]

There are seven dwarves who can request tasks. Only one of them has a task to give at any point in time. Each time that a task is fulfilled or failed, a different dwarf from the previous one is randomly chosen to be the new task-giver. Each of the shopkeepers seems to have even chances of being chosen, while the rowdy dwarf is selected much less frequently. Once a task-giver is selected, the game will determine what kind of item will be requested (e.g. for Saro, this can be either bars, ores, or armour). Finally, any item on the table fitting that description can be rolled with even odds.[1]

If the player wishes to receive a different task rather than fulfilling their current one, there are a few ways to do so: either log out, change worlds or talk to the dwarf and refuse to finish the job. Doing either of these will randomly select a new task-giver.Note:These methods only work while you have a current task. You cannot change task-givers without first finding and speaking with the one currently selected for you.
