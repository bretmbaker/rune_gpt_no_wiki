Mechanics[edit|edit source]

The Tombs of Amascut can be completed in a group of 1-8 players. In group encounters, the 2nd-3rd member will add 90% of the base health of bosses each, while the 4th and beyond will add 60% each.

It isnotpossible to caststandard spellbookutility spells inside the raid (with the exception ofTelekinetic Grab), although utility spells from theLunar spellbookdo work.

Bosses[edit|edit source]

The Tombs of Amascut comprise four paths, each one themed after one ofTumeken's avatars:Apmeken,Crondis,Het, andScabaras. Each path consists of a challenge section followed by a boss. These can be taken on in any order the player(s) choose to do so. If path leveling is active, the order in which the bosses are killed may matter; otherwise, there is not much of a difference.

Once all four paths are completed, the lower level where the final boss fight takes place becomes accessible, which consists of two twin bosses. After they are defeated, players can claim their rewards.

Invocations and Raid Level[edit|edit source]

Mode | Raid Level

 | Entry Mode | 0–149

 | Normal Mode | 150–299

 | Expert Mode | 300–600

The Tombs of Amascut makes use of the invocation system, which allows players to customise the difficulty of the raid by choosing to enable various invocations, setting aRaid Levelwhich adjusts the stats of NPCs within the raid; for every 5 raid levels, an NPC'shitpoints,defence, accuracy, and damage are increased by 2% additively, with damage capping out at +150%. For example, a raid level of 100 will modify these stats for all enemies within the raid by +40%, whereas a raid level of 500 will modify enemy hitpoints, defence, and accuracy by +200%, and damage by +150%.

Apart from making the raid harder, a higher raid level increases the player's overall drops and the chances for unique items to be rolled, which are shown in the raid party's invocation tab within the raid party interface, accessed via theGrouping Obeliskwhere players can form raid parties.

Consumable items are received fromsuppliesgiven by theHelpful Spiritin the Nexus of the Tombs of Amascut. They can be claimed from the spirit once after completing two paths, and once again after completing the remaining two paths and before proceeding to the final encounter.

Death within the Tombs[edit|edit source]

By default, players may die any number of times if the team does not have a limited attempt invocation enabled. If one of these invocations are enabled, however, then an attempt is counted once the entire team dies during a challenge. Additionally, the team will have to restart the room they have all died in, with previous progress being saved and being givenhoney locustsshould the "On a Diet" invocation be inactive.

If the entire team is killed and there are no more limited attempts left, players will lose all unprotected items, which can later be reclaimed from a storage where the reclaim fee is based on the items' respectiveGrand Exchangevalues, up to a maximum fee of 500,000 coins.

If players die a second time without reclaiming the items from the storage, they will be permanently lost, unless the death occurs within a minigame deemed safe, such asPest Control.

Dying in the Tombs of Amascut is adangerousdeath -Hardcore Ironmenwho die within the tomb will lose their Hardcore status.

Adisconnector logout while not inside a safe area such as the nexus of the tomb will count as a death inside the tombs.

A failure to reconnect to a party after a disconnect from an unsafe area (e.g. due to logging in on the wrong world) will always result in a dangerous death forHardcore Ironmen, and all items stored inside anitem retrieval service(deathbank) will be lost if death invocations are enabled.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Upon defeating the Wardens, the party will be able to access the treasure room and receive their reward for helpingOsmumtendefeatAmascut's thralls.

Like theTheatre of Blood, if a unique drop is rolled at the end of the raid, Osmumten's sarcophagus will glow purple instead of white with the designated player being able to open it instead of the chests by the side. When the sarcophagus is opened, an animation plays which reveals the item. Only one unique can be obtained per raid, if any at all. If no unique item is rolled, then the chest will contain three rolls from the common drop table. The unique drops that players can obtain from the sarcophagus include:

Pieces of theMasori armour:Masori maskMasori bodyMasori chapsLightbearerOsmumten's fangElidinis' wardTumeken's shadow

Additionally, there are tertiary items which can be rolled alongside any reward. The unique tertiary rewards from the Tombs of Amascut include

Thread of elidinis, can be used to create thedivine rune pouchJewels with the ability to enhance thekeris partisan:Breach of the scarabEye of the corruptorJewel of the sunAnd the pet from the raid,Tumeken's guardian

If the player finished the raid with fewer than 1,500 points, they will instead receivefossilised dung.

If the player leaves the room after opening the chest, rewards can be found through the rewards niche in the south-east corner of the lobby room. If the player re-enters the raid without claiming their rewards from the rewards niche, they will be lost; the player will be warned of this prior to entering another raid.
