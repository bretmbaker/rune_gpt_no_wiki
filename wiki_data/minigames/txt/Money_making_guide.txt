[Minigame: Money_making_guide]

This is a list of some of the ways to makemoney(money makers) inOld School RuneScapeand the requirements to do so. The prices and hourly rates are simply an estimate. The actual rates and profit are likely to differ. There are likely other ways that aren't included here; feel free to suggest them on thetalk page.

If you notice a discrepancy between profits listed here and profits listed on guide pages, it is probably because of a caching issue. You can clear the cache and force an update by clickinghere.

Notes:

Caution:You should always research the items and methods before trying these methods. Because of constantly changing prices of items, the estimated profit may be inaccurate.Any method in the "Hourly Profit" section that relies on buying an item from theGrand Exchangedoes not take into account the time needed to purchase the item or itsbuy limit.Therefore, do not assume the rate of item purchases on the GE matches the rate of item processing of the method.All prices are calculated using current Grand Exchangemarket prices, meaning the actual profit per hour may vary greatly from what is stated here. If you notice a discrepancy between profits listed here and profits listed on guide pages, it is likely a caching issue. You can force this page to update by clickinghere.

Hourly profit table

Note:Most money making methods rely onGrand Exchangeitem prices (taking into account the GE tax), which may fluctuate as players constantly sell for higher or lower than the listed price, and some items are less stable than others. For methods involving the processing of items, it is recommended to test each method with a small sample size before investing a lot of money, as the prices may not be fully accurate, possibly resulting in loss instead of profit.

Miscellaneous methods

Merchanting

Grand Exchangeflipping, or merchanting, is the high-risk, high-reward activity of buying items for a low price and selling them at a higher price. You are looking foritemsthat are unstable, but are frequently traded, with a changing price due to supply and demand.

Untradeable supplies

Certain money making methods use untradeable supplies that are gathered passively through normal gameplay, the time taken to gather these ingredients is impossible to objectively quantify with a specific value so they are assumed to be "zero time" to gather in these guides.
