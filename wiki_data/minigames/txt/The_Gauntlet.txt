Map



The Gauntletis a solominigameinPrifddinasin which the player is given a limited amount of time to explore a randomly generated dungeon layout, gather various resources and supplies by skilling and defeating crystalline monsters, all in preparation to defeat theCrystalline Hunllef, which is based upon a deadly wolf-like predator from the elven homeworld of Tarddiad. The Gauntlet was created as a training ground by theAmlodd Clanto ensure their warriors were capable of defending Prifddinas during theGod Wars.

The Gauntlet can be found by entering theGauntlet Portal, found in the north-western part of Prifddinas.

Playerscannotbring any items into the Gauntlet; when entering the minigame, all items currently on the player will be automatically stored for its duration. Any pre-applied skill boosts will also be removed upon entry to the Gauntlet. It is a dangerous minigame, sohardcore ironmenwill lose their hardcore status, and ultimate ironmen will lose items ininstanced banksshould they die in The Gauntlet.

The area contains resource nodes,herbsandfishobtainable throughMining,Woodcutting,Fishingand other gathering methods, in order to make weapons, armour, potions and food. These various resources do not require a specific skill level to gather. The dungeon will also contain various crystalline monsters, such asbats,unicornsanddark beasts, which can be killed for further supplies. Higher level monsters will offer better drops at the cost of taking more time to defeat.

Completion of The Gauntlet will reward players with various loot, includingcrystal armour seedsforcrystal armour, as well asenhanced crystal weapon seedsfor theBlade of Saeldoror theBow of Faerdhinenand thecrystal shardsrequired to charge the items. Failing to finish, either by death or leaving early, will give a small token reward based upon how well the player performed, but will not grant any chance of unique items.

Basic overview[edit|edit source]

The map consists of a 7x7 grid of rooms, and the player starts adjacent to the centre room that contains The Gauntlet's boss: theCrystalline Hunllef. The player has 10 minutes to prepare to fight this boss, which is indicated by a timer. If the timer runs out, the player will automatically get teleported into the boss room. The player can also choose to manually enter the boss room before the timer ends.

During this 10 minute preparation time, the player may use the resources of The Gauntlet's environment to create a set up to challenge the Crystalline Hunllef. This set up may consist of three tiers of halberds, staves, bows, helmets, body armours and leg armours, as well as food and a potion that restoresrun energyandprayer points.

Resource rooms[edit|edit source]

Each room in The Gauntlet, except for the starting room and the boss room, contains resource nodes and/or monsters. These resource nodes and monsters are farmed to collect resources that can be processed at theSinging Bowlin the starting room.

There are five types of resource nodes. Each resource room will contain zero to five resource nodes. A resource room may contain a combination of different resource nodes.

Four raw paddlefish can be collected from each Fishing Spot. Used for food within The Gauntlet, healing 20 Hitpoints when cooked. Also counts as a water source to fill vials.

Collecting resources from the aforementioned nodes may reward the player withcrystal shards.

The inner 3x3 area adjacent to the boss room is guaranteed to include 4 rooms containing each at least 3 Crystal Deposits, Linum Tirinum, Phren Roots and weak monsters respectively.
This does not apply to theCorrupted Gauntlet.

There are nine types of monsters that can be found within the resource rooms, that can be categorized into three categories:

Weak monsters:Crystalline Spiders(level 22),Crystalline Rats(level 24) andCrystalline Bats(level 33).Strong monsters:Crystalline Unicorns(level 48),Crystalline Scorpions(level 64) andCrystalline Wolves(level 74).Demi-bosses:Crystalline Bears(level 172),Crystalline Dragons(level 172) andCrystalline Dark Beasts(level 172).

The above monsters may be killed for the following items:

Guaranteed drop from the firstCrystalline Bearkilled.Crystal orb:Used to create the highest tier staff. Guaranteed drop from the firstCrystalline Dragonkilled.Crystalline bowstring:Used to create the highest tier bow. Guaranteed drop from the firstCrystalline Dark Beastkilled.

Armour and weaponry[edit|edit source]

The Singing Bowl can be used to create armour and weapons. Since the Crystalline Hunllef usesprotection prayers, at least two different types of weapons are required.

There are three types of weapons: bows (Ranged), halberds (Melee) and staves (Magic). These weapons are available in three tiers: basic, attuned and perfected. Higher tiers are created by upgrading from their previous tiers.

The creation of each of the three weapon types requires the same resources:

Basic(tier 1): Aweapon frameand 20crystal shards.Attuned(tier 2): Basic weapon and 60 crystal shards.Perfected(tier 3): Attuned weapon and acrystal spike(for the halberd),crystal orb(for the staff) orcrystalline bowstring(for the bow).

Weapons from higher tiers give the player higher accuracy and/or damage. See the table below for an overview of each weapon's bonuses:

There are three armour pieces: helmets, bodies and legs, and they are available in three tiers: basic, attuned and perfected. Higher tiers are created by upgrading from their previous tiers.

The creation of each armour piece requires the following resources:

 | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | 

Body | Legs | Helm | Total | Body | Legs | Helm | Total | Total (1+2) | Body | Legs | Helm | Total | Total (All)

Ore | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 7 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 13

Shards | 40 | 40 | 40 | 120 | 60 | 60 | 60 | 180 | 300 | 80 | 80 | 80 | 240 | 540

Armour pieces from higher tiers give player higher defence bonuses and mitigate more damage of the Crystalline Hunllef's attacks. It appears that the damage reduction is roughly 13.33% per level. See the table below for each armour piece's bonuses:

Item | Attack Bonuses | Defence Bonuses | Other

Wearing pieces of the crystal armour will further reduce damage taken from the Crystalline Hunllef's attacks. The table below describes its max hit while wearing different combinations of armour while using the correct protection prayer against its magic and ranged attacks.

Armour combination | Crystalline Hunllef's max hit | Damage from tornadoes

N/A | No armour | 12 | 10-20

 | Full T1 armour | 10 | 10-16

 | Full T2 armour | 8 | 7-13

 | Full T3 armour | 6 | 5-10

Boss room[edit|edit source]

After the 10 minute timer, the player is automatically teleported into the final room. The player may also choose to manually pass the barrier to the boss room if they're ready before the timer is done.

The boss room always lies directly adjacent to the starting room.

If the player dies as the boss dies, kill count credit will not be awarded.

Corrupted Gauntlet[edit|edit source]

After completing the Gauntlet once, players may try the Corrupted Gauntlet, which has increased difficulty compared to the regular Gauntlet.

Differences include:

All monsters are Corrupted instead of Crystalline, with increased stats.All items are Corrupted instead of Crystal, with the same stats.The player only has 7 minutes and 30 seconds to prepare compared to the normal version at 10 minutes.Resource generation of the inner 3x3 area adjacent to the boss room does not have randomness mitigation, with the exception of one room being guaranteed to contain 3 fishing spots.

Boss Room[edit|edit source]

The boss room instead contains theCorrupted Hunllef, which has 1000 health and increased aggressive stats. The table below describes its max hit while wearing different combinations of armour while using the correct protection prayer against its magic and ranged attacks.If running full T2, consider making a T3 helm instead of a T2 body if you have spare shards. At the cost of 20 more shards, you'll gain +4 defence bonus stats whilst still retaining the T2 reduced damage effect, even though you technically did not have a full T2 set.It appears that the sum of armour tiers being worn is what determines the max hit of Hunllef's attacks and tornadoes, as 2 T3 pieces provided the same damage reduction as a full set of T2 armour.

Armour combination | Corrupted Hunllef's max hit | Damage from tornadoes

N/A | No armour | 16 | 15-30

 | Full T1 armour | 13 | 14-25

 | Full T2 armour | 10 | 10-20

 | Full T3 armour | 8 | 8-15
