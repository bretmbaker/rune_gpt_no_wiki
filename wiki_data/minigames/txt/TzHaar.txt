TheTzHaar(Jagex:/zɑːr/ZAR) are araceof golem-like creatures that inhabitMor Ul Rek, a lava-filled region beneathKaramjaVolcano. The word "TzHaar" means "holy (sacred) fire". The TzHaar society is unlike any other, and only vaguely resembles any that exists on the surface.

Despite their fearsome appearance, the TzHaar are a peaceful race, and have existed beneath the surface of Karamja for thousands of years. Even today, the finer aspects of their society remain a point of great mystery amongst scholars.

Biology[edit|edit source]

Biologically, the TzHaar are one ofGielinor's greatest marvels. They appear roughly humanoid, but are made of solidobsidianand magma. Even though they appear fearsome, they are actually gentle and kind, albeit still wary of outsiders. They possess four powerful arms, and are physically very strong, with their guards capable of lifting massive mauls using a single hand.

Strangely, they are born fromeggs, which are incubated in birthing pools of molten lava throughout the inner city. The TzHaar have the unique ability of memory transfer; a TzHaar will retain all of the knowledge and memories its ancestors had before it. This generally makes the TzHaar a very wise race. The deeper the egg is placed in the lava, the more memories they would absorb. This however, has lead to the birth of feral monsters which remain trapped within theInferno, an ancient incubation chamber.

TzHaar live very long lives, although the exact length is unknown. As they grow older, their bodies begin to lose heat and solidification begins. They are able to delay this process by resting interminal chambers, where they draw warmth from the volcano.

Even stranger than their birth is their death. When the TzHaar die, their bodies harden and lose all mobility, becomingHaar-Tok. Yet, even as their bodies fail, their minds remain eternally locked within their corpses, which are often displayed in a statue-like state or broken down into the holy currency known asTokkul.

The caste system[edit|edit source]

The most important part of TzHaar society is itscaste system, which dictates what a TzHaar will do in life. At birth a TzHaar's caste is chosen based on their physical and mental traits, and they strictly follow this for the rest of their life.

The caste operates on four types; theTzHaar-Ket, theTzHaar-Xil, theTzHaar-Mej, and theTzHaar-Hur. Unlike many caste systems, each of the TzHaar castes is considered equal in power and respectability, but differs in its role in society. By dividing themselves, the TzHaar are able to effectively manage their people and retain a power balance.

TzHaar-Ket[edit|edit source]

TheTzHaar-Ketare the guardian and police force of the TzHaar. Towering over the other castes, the TzHaar-Ket are fearsome soldiers that follow a code not unlike the concept ofchivalry.

In combat they use weapons such asTzhaar-ket-omandTzhaar-ket-emand protect themselves withToktz-ket-xil. If ever their city were threatened, the TzHaar-Ket would be the first to defend it.

TzHaar-Xil[edit|edit source]

TheTzHaar-Xilare the hunting class, being agile, yet adept in combat. They attack with ranged and melee attacks. The melee version attack with theToktz-xil-akand the rangers attack withToktz-xil-ul.

TzHaar-Mej[edit|edit source]

TheTzHaar-Mejare the mystic class of the TzHaar, although they are also the city's leading and governing class. Whether or not a single TzHaar rules is unclear, and it is possible that all TzHaar-Mej are part of a council.

As mystics, the TzHaar-Mej are generally the wisest. They are capable of defeating their opponents withmagics, wielding an obsidian staff known as aToktz-mej-tal.

TzHaar-Hur[edit|edit source]

TheTzHaar-Hurare the craftsman class of the TzHaar. If pressed to combat, the TzHaar-Hur use only their fists, but would call other TzHaar to their aid.

Despite their lack of combat ability, the TzHaar-Hur are incredibly important to the TzHaar, and are capable of forging weaponry from obsidian found in the volcano.

History[edit|edit source]

Very little is known of the TzHaar's early history. They believe that "They were born on the day volcano shook foundation of earth." This would suggest they were born some time during theFirst Age. Others believe the TzHaar may be a remnant from an age inGielinorthat predates even Guthix's arrival. While the origins of the Tzhaar race are unknown to the "Old School" universe, it is confirmed that the Tzhaar and sub-races were created byFulinRuneScape.However, sinceOld School RuneScapeandRuneScapeare separate titles, the current holes in the "Old School" lore may choose to deviate from this.

The TzHaar lived for thousands of years beneath the holy fires of the volcano, lasting out theSecond Ageand cataclysmicGod Warswith little surface contact. For millennia they carved a great city from the living earth, entering an age of prosperity with no war, crime, or concept of evil.

Some of the TzHaar, who were patiently awaiting orders from their creators, saw Gielinor in turmoil. These TzHaar left Mor Ul Rek forMount Karuulm, a volcano far west, calling themselves theTasakaal. The Tasakaal obtained their own servants, called theKahlith, former humans who devoted their lives to maintaining the balance.

In the year 169 of theFifth Age, a more continuous stream of contact was established between the TzHaar and the outside world. The TzHaar remain cautious of humans, and most of their city still remains off-limits to outsiders, only allowing those who they deem worthy to enter their inner city.

Mor Ul Rek used to have a very large incubation chamber in the centre of the city. Following TzHaar biology, as they gain memories of their ancestors while in the lava, the TzHaar realized that the deeper the egg was placed in the lava, the more memories they would absorb. They continued to repeat this process to gain ancient knowledge, though they eventually drained the chamber of all lava, creating a large sinkhole that revealed theInferno, an ancient incubation chamber.

Wanting to uncover more of their ancestors' memories, the TzHaar decided to place eggs in there. The result was that the hatched eggs became feral monsters (referred to as Jal by the TzHaar) who fought each other for dominance. These feral TzHaar are very intimidating and much more powerful than their current counterparts; even the stronger TzHaar-Ket are hesitant to challenge them. An ancient being sealed in the birthing chamber,TzKal-Zuk, grew took control of the Jal, with the TzHaar offering it sacrifices to keep him at bay, fearing that he would attempt to escape to the surface to obtain memories beyond the Inferno. Some of the TzHaar sponsored JalYt challengers to attempt the Inferno, hoping that their "foreign" equipment would allow them to succeed where they could not.

Language[edit|edit source]

The TzHaar language has not been fully translated, and as of yet only a few basic words and phrases are known to humans. From what little is understood, the TzHaar language combines words to form longer phrases; for instance, in the TzHaar word for humans, "JalYt", "Jal" translates to "foreigner" and "Yt" translates to "cold"; literally meaning "cold foreigner".

Fortunately, most TzHaar are willing to speak the human language, although a basic understanding of certain words is helpful when visiting the city.

The language doesn't work in the same way as human languages, so it's more about the emotion and passion behind the word rather than the literal translation. Most of the current knowledge consists of nouns, adjectives, and an extremely limited selection of verbs.

Words[edit|edit source]

Most of these words are taken fromRuneScape'sTzHaar Tourist Guideor other texts fromRuneScape, which Old SchoolJagex Moderatorshave used in TzHaar related content.

Titles[edit|edit source]

In dialogue with most of the inhabitants of Mor Ul Rek, the TzHaar will address the adventurer with a bespoke TzHaar name fitting certain of their attributes. This name is a compound of two to three prefixes attached to the player's common tongue name. In general, a TzHaar name adheres to the following structure:

Unlike some of the other names assigned to the player (such as thegoblinorvampyric name), the elements that compose their TzHaar name are not chosen randomly, but are determined by specific conditions. These conditions are laid out in the table below:

Race | Condition

JalYt | If the name refers to ahuman.

TzHaar | If the name refers to a TzHaar.

Kaal | If the name refers to aTasakaal.

Caste | Condition

Mej | If the sum of the player'sMagicandPrayeris the highest among the listed skill pairs.

Ket | If the sum of the player'sStrengthandDefenceis the highest among the listed skill pairs.

Xil | If the sum of the player'sAttackandAgilityis the highest among the listed skill pairs.

Hur | If the sum of the player'sCraftingandSmithingis the highest among the listed skill pairs.

Honorific | Condition

Xo | If the player has gained access to the inner core ofMor Ul Rekby showing theirfire capeto aTzHaar-Ket.

Kal | If the player has defeatedTzKal-Zukin theInferno.

In case multiple skill pairs add up to the same value, the caste prefix assigned to the player is determined by the following order of priority:

Religion[edit|edit source]

TzHaar religion is a mystery. Some believe they follow an ancientgod, who created the volcano. This has not been confirmed inOld School RuneScape, but is confirmed in theRuneScapelore of the Tzhaar, with this god beingFul.

Whether they follow a god or not, the TzHaar seem to see their volcano as sacred. TzHaar legend says that they were created along with it at the dawn of time, from the sacred fires of the forgotten earth. The creatures that were created along with it, such as the fearsomeTzTok-Jad, are viewed as sacred as well.

The TzHaar believe that when they die, their souls will eventually be brought to the heart of the volcano and given new life. TzHaar prophecy says that one day their race will draw to an end. The volcano will sink back into the earth, and the cold seas will flood their city, bringing an end to their people forever.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

The TzHaar society seems to be somewhat based on parts of Indian or Hindu culture; they have a caste system, believe in reincarnation and have multiple arms. This might reference the fact that a lot of Hindu deities are depicted as having multiple arms. This is further represented by the grammatical structure of the Tzhaar language.The Toktz-Xil-Ul is based on the real-lifechakram, an Indian circular weapon which features a sharpened outer edge. It was primarily used as a throwing weapon, although it could also serve in hand-to-hand combat.
