ARewards Chestcan be found upon completion of waves during theFortis Colosseumminigame, containing all accumulated rewards from each wave.

Loot mechanics[edit|edit source]

Before the start of every wave, an interface will appear showing players the rewards they'll receive in the next wave upon successfully clearing it. The player has the option to continue their run, potentially acquiring better loot, or end their run and walk away with the rewards they've accumulated so far. If the player dies during a wave, all of the accumulated rewards from the previous waves are lost. The rewardsmustbe claimed from the chest before leaving, or they will likewise be lost.

Upon theendof wave 3, the chest will begin to roll the unique drop table, with the chance increasing as the player reaches higher waves. Upon successfully rolling the unique table, the chest will then roll for following items:

6/16 for anecho crystal; a successful roll for 1 will additionally roll a 1/10 chance of receiving either 2 or 3 crystals.9/16 for a piece of thesunfire fanatic armour. There is a duplicate-avoidance system and the game will give preference to a piece not received; otherwise, all parts have an equal chance of rolling.1/16 for the unchargedTonalztics of Ralosafter wave 7.

The effective rates for the aforementioned items is as follows;Gloryplays no role in rolling the unique drop table.

Wave | Overall Unique chance | Cumulative Unique chance | Echo crystal | Sunfire fanatic armour | Tonalztics of Ralos

4 | 1/124 | 1/124 | 1/310 | 1/206.67 | 

5 | 1/110 | 1/59 | 1/275 | 1/183.33 | 

6 | 1/96 | 1/37 | 1/240 | 1/160 | 

7 | 1/82 | 1/25 | 1/218.67 | 1/145.78 | 1/1312

8 | 1/68 | 1/19 | 1/181.33 | 1/120.89 | 1/1088

9 | 1/54 | 1/14 | 1/144 | 1/96 | 1/864

10 | 1/40 | 1/11 | 1/106.67 | 1/71.11 | 1/640

11 | 1/26 | 1/8 | 1/69.33 | 1/46.22 | 1/416

12 | 1/12 | 1/5 | 1/32 | 1/21.33 | 1/192

Lastly, completing wave 12 will guaranteeDizana's quiverfrom the rewards chest. Additionally, a flat 1/200 chance for the petSmol hereditis rolled. The quiver can later be given toMinimusfor either 4,000sunfire splintersor another 1/200 chance at receiving Smol heredit.

As wave 1 has a guaranteed drop of 80 sunfire splinters and, depending on the player's gear, can be cleared in about 25-60 seconds, repeatedly clearing the first wave makes for an ideal method of obtaining sunfire splinters for players unable to consistently clear the higher waves. Those who can clear the entire run, however, will find themselves getting more splinters at a more consistent rate due to the higher drop rates and quantities in the later waves, especially should they choose to exchange their (excess) quivers for splinters.
