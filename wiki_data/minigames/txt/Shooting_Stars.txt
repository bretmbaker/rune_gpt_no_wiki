Shooting Starsare aDistraction and Diversionin which a meteoroid falls from the sky approximately every hour and a half (90 minutes) across every in-gameserver. These appear asCrashed Starsthat can be mined forstardust, which members can exchange ata shoprun byDusuriat theMining Guildentrance inFalador.

On every world, a shooting star will fall at a random spot selected from a predetermined list roughly every 90 minutes (with a variation of up to 15 minutes), although stars on different worlds may fall closer in time to one another, or even at the same time.

Although the activity is available infree-to-playworlds, players only get awarded half the experience points. On top of that,Dusuri's Star Shop, where players can exchange stardust for rewards, ismembersonly.

If a player is standing near the crash site where a shooting star is falling, they will hear a whistling sound as it falls from the sky and the crash as it impacts the ground.

Locating[edit|edit source]

Members can use atelescopein astudy roomin aplayer-owned houseto find the approximate area and time of the next landing. It is also possible to use telescopes in another player's house for this purpose.

If the telescope is blocked by another room in the house, (not including outdoor rooms such as theMenagerie), or the room is underground, it will not work.Better telescopes provide a more accurate time window:Oak telescope- 24-minute windowTeak telescope- 9-minute windowMahogany telescope- 2-minute windowIf a star has recently fallen, the following text appears:"You look through the telescope but you don't see anything interesting."

Join the Shooting Starsgroupingchat via the grouping menu to share locations with other players.

Mining[edit|edit source]

Crashed Starsfall in sizes from 6 to 9. Players can find out how large the star is by prospecting it. Additionally, prospecting it will reveal the progress to the next level.

 | Crashed Star discovered

The jingle that plays upon discovering a crashed star.



The first person to attempt to mine the crashed star will be notified in the chatbox that they are the first to find the star, alongside ajingle. This person also will receive double the stardust for the next 300 they mine as a reward. (Note: This bonus stardust does not need to come from the same star that granted the bonus, and seems to persist after logging out or a server update). In addition, their name will be added to theShooting Star Noticeboardin the reception room north of theObservatory; up to five players are displayed on the noticeboard.  If another crashed star is discovered while still having a remaining bonus from a previous discovery, the previous bonus will be lost and the new bonus will be set to 300.

Each layer of the star is mined from 0% to 100%, at which point the outermost layer sloughs off, and the star's size is reduced by one tier. The amount left to mine of the current layer can be determined by prospecting while mining. Each layer willalwaysdeplete at a fixed rate of 7 minutes, up to a maximum of 63 minutes for a size 9 star, provided there is at least one player mining it.

Players will receivestardustas they mine the crashed star, receiving 32 experience each time a piece of stardust is mined (16 experience on Free-to-play worlds). A roll for mining stardust is performed regularly based on the player'sMininglevel, scaling from 29% to 46% at levels 1 to 99.Mining enhancersthat multiply yield donotwork on crashed stars.

Players may receive a petrock golemwhilst mining, where the base chance is 1/521,550.

Once the final layer (when the star is size one) is fully mined, the star will crumble and disappear. Stars will also disappear if they have not been fully mined once a new star crashes within the same world.[1]

Mining Success Chance[edit|edit source]

Notes[edit|edit source]

The Star fall cycle will reset during a system update and stars on the ground before the update will vanish. Stars will then begin landing 20–50 minutes after the game goes back online, and then cycle as normal (every ~90 minutes)It is possible that the telescopes of two POH will show different timers. (For example, one might say its 10–12 minutes away while the other says 9–11 minutes). In this case the landing time is narrowed down to the time when the timers overlap (In this case in 10–11 minutes)Only one star can crash per given world at a time. If a star is not mined or finished being mined, it will automatically despawn when the next star falls.The experience given for mining stardust is halved in free-to-play.Theadamant pickaxe's 4-tickcycle allows it to be used fortick manipulationwhile mining shooting stars, unlike other pickaxes.Gems are able to be obtained from mining stars. A chargedamulet of glorywill increase this rate. Agem bagmay be worth bringing while mining shooting stars.

Landing sites[edit|edit source]

Members may make use of atelescopeto reveal the general area in which the star will fall, wherein there are a number of set locations in which the star may land. A star will not land in the same spot twice in a row.[2]

The only way to locate the actual crash site is to search each possible crash site in the given area until thecrashed staris found; this process, as well as the mining process, can be greatly expedited with the assistance of other players.

There are a total of 79 possible landing sites, 21 of which are located in free-to-play areas. Stars may land in members areas on free-to-play worlds.

Historical[edit|edit source]

As a piece of content brought intoOld School RuneScapeviabackporting, Shooting Stars were originally released on 2 September 2008 inRuneScapeas one of threeDistractions and Diversions, alongsideBalthazar Beauregard's Big Top BonanzaandPenguin Hide and Seek.

Like most content backported intoOld School RuneScape, the Shooting Stars forOld Schoolhas a few differences which aim to better adapt it forOld School RuneScape.

RuneScapehas 44 possible landing sites;Old School RuneScapehas 79.Originally, Shooting Stars were only available formembers. This was changed on 9 October 2017 inRuneScape.On free-to-play worlds, Shooting Stars may crash in a members area, rendering it out of reach.Mining experience on free-to-play servers is half that of on members servers.There is no additional experience given for the first player to mine the fallen star.Players receive a reduced amount of experience per stardust.InRuneScape,players could hold only up to 200 stardust, and could only exchange it once per day.Old School RuneScapedoes not have either of these limits.Star Spritesdo not exist inOld School RuneScape; rewards are exchanged for stardust via a shop run by Dusuri instead.
