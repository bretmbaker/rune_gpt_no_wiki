Pure essenceis a raw material used in theRunecraftskillto make all types ofrunes. They can create the same runes asrune essenceas well ascosmic,chaos,astral,nature,law,death,blood,wrathand anycombination runes. Pure essence does not provide any bonus over rune essence when crafting runes lower than cosmic runes; they are however much cheaper.

Unlike runes, pure essence does not stack.Essence pouchescan be used to transport additional essence, when collecting or using pure essence to craft runes. Pure essence is one of the most commonly traded items inRuneScape, due to its very high demand by runecrafters.

Obtaining pure essence[edit|edit source]

Memberswith aMininglevel of at least 30 will mine pure essence instead ofrune essence(both granting 5experience) on member worlds at theRune essence mine, after completing theRune Mysteriesquest. To access this mine, which contains four rocks with an unending supply of essence, players must get teleported by one of the fiveNPCs who are able to do so. The speed at which essence is mined does not depend on the player's Mining level, but rather their pickaxe's tier.[1]As such, this means every roll at mining essence will be successful.

It is possible for players withessence pouchesand a high levelpickaxeto mine upwards of 2,100 pure essence an hour. If mining pure essence, players should consider takingweight-reducing clothing, orenergy-boosting itemsand the aforementioned essence pouches so that more pure essence can be mined per hour. The best place to mine essence is by going toWizard Distentorwho is located in theWizards' GuildinYanille, but this requires 66Magic. Players without this level should go forAuburyinVarrock. Members who have unlockedGuardians of the Riftmay also useArchmage SedridoratWizards' Tower, using the portal to bank at the minigame for a very short travel time. However, players can also go toBrimstailatTree Gnome Stronghold,Wizard CrompertyinArdougne, or theLunar Isle mineif they so choose. However, these locations are not recommended, due to their comparatively long distances frombanks.

Wizard Cromperty in Ardougne will also provide 100 free noted pure essence daily for those who have completed themedium Ardougne Diary.

Since the release of theNightmare Zoneminigame, players are able to acquire large sums of pure essence in this minigame by spending points. Due to the ease of acquiring essence with this method, the price for pure essence has gone down significantly, and has caused the price of pure essence to be lower than that of the less popularrune essence.

Ironmenwho have completedIn Aid of the MyrequeandDarkness of Hallowvalemay findTemple Trekkinga good way of obtaining pure essence relatively early on, before options such asZulrahorGargoylesare viable. By using easy NPCs and route one, most encounters are fairly fast or can be evaded, and each reward token gives 50+ essence. This can lead to approximately 3,000 essence per hour. As an alternative, stronger players can take easy NPCs through route 3, and are rewarded with approximately 600 essence per run, resulting in up to 8,000 essence per hour. Finally, with partial completion ofDesert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire, theScar essence minecan yield up to 10,000 essence per hour.

Uses[edit|edit source]

Quests[edit|edit source]

Priest in Peril: 50 × pure essence (alternativelyrune essence)

Runecraft[edit|edit source]

When training Runecraft, pure essence is a common choice for the input resource. Because it is one of the only twotradeableessences, and the only tradeable essence that can craft members-only runes, some players will trade with other players at the runic altars to increase the amount of runes they can craft per trip, extending to being able to permanently stay at the altar with a high enough trade frequency. This practice is calledessence running. Essence running is allowed at all altars except at theOurania Altar, where trading is prohibited.
