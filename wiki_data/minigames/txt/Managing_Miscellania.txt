Managing Miscellaniais a repeatable reward/activity unlocked with the completion of theThrone of Miscellaniaquest. The activity involves assigning the citizens of the island ofMiscellania(and additionallyEtceteriaafter the completion ofRoyal Trouble) to collect a mixture of different resources available on the island/s.  Resources may be collected as often as once per day, which results in the resources being deposited directly in theplayer'sbank (meaning ultimate ironmen cannot gain resources from this activity).

The number of resources collected depends on both the player's popularity with the citizens as well as their daily wage, which is taken daily as a percentage of the coins the player has invested in the Miscellania coffers.

The player may manage citizen assignments, deposit or withdraw from the coffers, and collect gathered resources fromAdvisor Ghrimon the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]of the Miscellania castle on the west side of the island.NPC Contactmay be used to collect resources and change labour assignments, but it cannot be used to adjust the coffers.

The player may raise their popularity by performing various tasks on Miscellania (and laterEtceteriaafter the completion of Royal Trouble). Your popularity will decrease daily by 2.5% (1% after Royal Trouble)

Because of the valuable resources obtained, managing Miscellania can result in profitable passive income. Keeping your popularity high and amount invested maxed out will allow for maximum profit.

Completion ofRoyal Troublegreatly improves the output gained from this activity, increasing the citizens available from 10 to 15, improving their productivity by 50%, and increasing the maximum rate of the daily wage from50,000to75,000. Additionally, it allows you access to hardwood woodcutting and farming output.

Factors[edit|edit source]

Coffers and salary distribution[edit|edit source]

The coffers hold coins to distribute to all the subjects at a daily rate. Payment is deducted from the coffers and resources are collected at midnight UTC every day. The more the workers are paid, the higher the daily yield is. A maximum of5,000,000coins may be stored in the coffers initially, which increases to7,500,000coins after Royal Trouble has been completed.

The daily rate is 10% of the coffers current holdings, up to50,000or75,000after Royal Trouble. To get the most out of the activity, it is therefore recommended to keep the coffers at a minimum of500,000after Throne of Miscellania or750,000after Royal Trouble. With full coffers, 90 withdrawals will be made before it goes below this recommended amount.

If there is money in the coffers and the player'smembershipends, the workers still continue gathering resources and deducting money from the coffers accordingly. This is also true for when members get temporarybans. Therefore if players plan on renewing their membership later, it is recommended to fill the coffers with as much as players can spare in order to take advantage of the days without membership as well. Conversely, if players plan on not renewing their membership, it is strongly recommended to withdraw all money and resources from Miscellania, as it will become impossible to recover anything upon losing membership.

Expenditure of labour[edit|edit source]

Players initially have 10 subjects available to them, increasing to 15 after Royal Trouble has been completed.

In total, there are six forms of labour players can distribute to their subjects: collecting herbs, woodcutting, mining, fishing, hardwood woodcutting, and farming. The latter two become available only after Royal Trouble is completed, as they are located in Etceteria. Each form of labour can be assigned a maximum of 10 workers. Unused labour will be shown in the idle bar at the lower left of the interface. Coins will be used up at the same rate regardless of how much labour you leave idle, making it inadvisable to leave any workers idle.

Completing Royal Trouble increases each subject's productivity by 50%. For example, a player with 10 subjects on maple woodcutting with 100% approval rating will get 595 maple logs and 5 bird nests per day, and 892 maple logs and 8 bird nests per day after Royal Trouble has been completed.

Which resources will be collected is determined at the time when players collect their resources. The player can redistribute labour prior to collection to retroactively apply new parameters throughout the entire period. This does not work for the payment or favour, however.

Approval rating[edit|edit source]

The approval rating, ranging from 25% to 100%, reflects the feelings of the subjects towards the player, and influences their daily yield. The approval rating automatically falls by 2.5% every day, or by 1% after Royal Trouble. Players can check their approval rating by talking to Advisor Ghrim, speaking to any of the citizens, or viewing the completed quest details for Throne of Miscellania or Royal Trouble.

Players can increase their approval rating by helping the subjects of their kingdom with various skilling tasks. The approval rating will only increase if the subject recognises the player's work by saying "Thanks!". Once the approval rating reaches 100%, the subjects will prevent the player from performing any more tasks. No resources are gained from the activities, though full experience is gained. Raking weeds is an exception, as no experience is gained and the weeds are received.

Killing the subjects and stealing from market stalls on Miscellania are the only actions a player can take to lower approval rating. Committing these two acts on Etceteria does not lower the approval rating, even after completing Royal Trouble.

Completing the medium and elite tiers of theFremennik Diarywill add 10 or 15% chance to increase approval respectively. This will only have an impact on favour gaining tasks that have a percentage chance to offer approval (see the calculations table below)

The approval system is on a point system from 0 to 127, shown to the player as a percentage. The table below outlines the actions that influence approval rating.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

The resources gathered may either gain or lose profits depending on currentGrand Exchangerates. Players with an Ironman account should use their own discretion to determine which resources will be most valuable to them. Resources will be directly deposited into the player's bank, assuming there is sufficient room to do so, within the last tab the player viewed. If players receive seeds that are present in theseed vault, they will automatically be transferred to the vault rather than the player's bank.

There is a maximum limit on resources collected, which is reached at approximately eight months depending on favour and coffers upkeep. Players are informed of this by the citizens when gaining favour.
