Map



TheFortis Colosseumis a large stadium found on the cliffs east ofCivitas illa Fortis. Here, players can take on up to twelve waves of opponents, culminating with the final wave againstSol Heredit. Enemies will spawn in similarly to theTzHaar Fight CavesandInferno, though additional enemies will also spawn in during the wave.

The Fortis Cliffs were once home to a great temple, where convicts were taken to be sacrificed upon an altar in the name ofRalos. Sometime afterKing Maximus Tullusascended the throne, he ordered the temple to be destroyed, claiming the kingdom would no longer tolerate human sacrifices.[1]In its place, he had the Fortis Colosseum built, where warriors gather and battle for glory, with the blood spilled in battle symbolising an offering to Ralos.[2]As such, the Colosseum is overseen byoneof the sevenTeokiof Ralos. Meanwhile, the fighters are chosen by elite warriors known as the Lanistas.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

As with all of Varlamore the Fortis Colosseum requires completion of the questChildren of the Sun. There are three main methods for travelling to the Fortis Colosseum. These options, ordered from fast to slow, are:

Players can use thering of duelingteleport to Fortis Colosseum. (requires 12,000 glory)Players can take aQuetzalto Fortis Colosseum and walk east.Players can use theCivitas illa Fortis Teleportrequiring 54 magic and completion ofTwilight's Promiseand walk south-east.

Lobby area[edit|edit source]

Upon entering the Colosseum, players will arrive at a lobby area under the Colosseum itself, where they can enter the arena and begin the minigame by initially speaking toMinimus, the Colosseum Master. Abank chestsouth of the arena's entrance can be accessed by players who have obtained at least 2,000glory;Gloria, who is found by theColosseum scoreboard, will introduce players to the glory system.

The area is also filled withgladiatorsandguards. At the eastern side, players can findUeman, Teoki of RalosandSeia, Teoki of Ranul, who manage the religious aspects of the Colosseum.

Gameplay[edit|edit source]

Before progressing to the next wave, players must choose one of three modifiers that will make subsequent waves harder to clear, for example by reducing the player's maximumHitpoints, strengthening their opponents, or adding additional hazards to the arena. The modifiers offered are randomized and will persist for all subsequent waves of that run.

Alternatively, players can choose to end their Colosseum run with the spoils they've earned up to their current wave. Logging out during a run will be considered as a death; teleporting, however, is not, although it will still cause any accumulated loot to be forfeited.

The reclamation fee upondeathis reduced by 75% (up to125,000) until the player has completed 100 waves of the Colosseum; this also includes runs where the player completed waves but died.

Final boss[edit|edit source]

On the 12th and final wave, Sol Heredit will leap down from his throne and into the arena to battle the player. At the same time, a group of unarmoured gladiators will close off the centre of the arena, limiting the amount of space to a 16x16 area (with four tiles jutting out from the corners). He is primarily weak toslash, and uses two different types of AoE melee attacks, each of which have two distinct patterns.

These melee attacks are unaffected byProtect from Melee, but each pattern has a specific set of tiles that can be stood on to avoid taking damage from his attacks. As his health lowers to specific intervals, Sol Heredit will begin limiting the amount of space available to move in with beams of light, while also summoning a yellow crystal that will periodically stop and charge up a beam that deals massive damage if the player makes contact with it.

After falling below 90% of his health, he will begin to utilise special attacks, such as a three-hit melee combo that deals massive damage and disables overhead protection prayers, though it can be blocked on a perfect tick. He will also attempt to grapple the player, targeting a specific equipment slot that deals massive damage and puts it into the player's inventory if not blocked in time.

When Sol Heredit reaches ~150 hitpoints, he will enter an enrage phase, quickly engulfing the arena with beams of light until slain, making it important to kill him before this occurs.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

 | Ralos has smiled upon you...

Music that plays when defeating Sol Heredit.



Before starting a wave, an interface will appear indicating the loot from the current wave and loot from the upcoming wave. Players may choose to either continue and risk their rewards or end the run and claim all of their hard-won spoils. If the player dies, teleports out during a wave, or logs out, all accumulated loot will be lost. Ending a run or defeating Sol Heredit in wave 12 will result in arewards chestappearing in the centre part of the arena where rewards can be claimed. Minimus can be found beside the chest to allow players to exit the arena.

Unique rewards can be obtained from wave 3 onwards. Every wave after that has a progressively higher chance of awarding a unique items. Unique rewards from the chest include:

Players can choose to exchange theDizana's quiverwithMinimusfor an additional 1/200 chance to receive theSmol hereditpet[3]or for 4,000 sunfire splinters. Players who already have the pet will not be offered the option to gamble quivers for the pet, but can still exchange them for sunfire splinters.

Glory[edit|edit source]

Every time the player completes a wave, they will earnGlory, in which the amount gained is dependent on the player's performance - damage taken, time spent, errors made, and types of modifiers selected. A player's Glory does not accumulate like a currency, only their personal best matters.

Gaining more Glory also gives various benefits outside the Colosseum, where citizens may reward you based on how much has been earned:
