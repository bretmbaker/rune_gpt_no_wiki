Its tablet formis usable without unlocking the spell, albeit granting no experience. However,craftingthe tablet requires the player to have unlocked the spell.

Bones to Peaches is commonly used to extend trips when food is scarce but bones are plentiful, such as in theGod Wars Dungeonor theSmoke dungeon. Players may also consider the healing effect ofGuthan's equipmentas an alternative (or in addition) to the spell. Tablets can be used to save inventory space instead of bringing the runes required to cast the spell.

Demonic ashescannot be converted as they are not considered bones. Attempting to convert bones of a higher tier than big bones gives the messageThe bones you're holding aren't suitable for peachifying.Attempting to cast the spell without any bones gives the messageYou aren't holding any bones!

Casting the spell in theAl Kharid Palaceis a hard task in theLumbridge & Draynor Diary(using the tablet form of the spelldoes notwork).
