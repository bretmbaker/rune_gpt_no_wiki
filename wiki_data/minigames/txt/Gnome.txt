Gnomesare a race of small humanoids found in various parts ofGielinor. They can be found primarily in theKandarinregion, being most common in theTree Gnome Village,Tree Gnome Stronghold, andBattlefield of Khazard. Gnomes fight with primarily eitherrangedormeleeattacks, depending on the weapon they wield. They have different coloured hoods.

Gnomes can be pickpocketed at level 75Thievingyielding 133.5 Thievingexperience. It is not recommended to pickpocket them until level 85 Thieving, due to the high rate of failure until this level. Pickpocketing gnomes can be very convenient for those playingGnome Restaurantso the player does not need to leave to get moreking wormsortoad legs. It is also a good source of medium clue scrolls however, keep in mind that you will not receive a clue from pickpocketing an NPC if your inventory is full.
