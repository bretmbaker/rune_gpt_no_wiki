Scrolls of redirectionare a reward from theNightmare Zone, costing 775 reward points per scroll. Based on the expected value of spendingNightmare Zone pointsonherb boxes, they have a value of995 coins. Each scroll redirects a singleTeleport to house tabletto one of the following locations, provided that the player has theConstructionlevel to have their house moved there:Rimmington,Taverley(level 10),Pollnivneach(level 20),Hosidius(level 25),Rellekka(level 30),Aldarin(requires completion ofChildren of the Sunand level 35),Brimhaven(level 40),Yanille(level 50),Trollheim(requires completion ofEadgar's Ruse), andPrifddinas(requires completion ofSong of the Elvesand thus level 70).

If the player redirects a tablet and wishes to revert it back to its original form, the playerwill notget their scroll back; however, an unused scroll can be refunded without loss of points.

If the player obtains a redirected tablet without having the requirements to make the tablet in the first place, the reward points can be completely refunded by reverting the tablet.

Players can save an inventory space when going to theGod Wars Dungeonby redirecting two tablets to Trollheim, teleporting, and reverting the other back to a house tablet instead of carrying multiple teleports.
