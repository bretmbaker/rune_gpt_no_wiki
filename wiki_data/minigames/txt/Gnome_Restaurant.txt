Gnome Restaurant, known by the gnomes asAluft Aloft Gnome Food Delivery Service, is aminigamethat involvesGnome cooking, and delivering your creations to various customers as quickly as possible. To start the minigame, talk toGianne jnr.on the west end of the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]of theGrand Tree.

It is strongly recommended that you have completedThe Grand Treequest before playing this minigame.

Completing a delivery for the Gnome Restaurant is a requirement for themedium Western Provinces Diary.

Tutorial[edit|edit source]

To begin, players must complete the tutorial by speaking toGianne jnr.in theGrand Tree, located on the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]north of the bank. The tutorial requires the player to train in the art ofgnome cookingby speaking toAluft Gianne snr.andgnome cocktailsby speaking toBlurberry. A minimumcookinglevel of 29 is required in order to complete the training.

Speak toAluft Gianne snr.on the same platform asGianne jnr.. He will first provide a recipe book and then specify four differentgnome dishesto make. Players can tradeHudo, by thecooking rangenorth of Aluft Gianne snr., to purchase ingredients required.

Speak toBlurberry, located on the eastern platforms of the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]. Blurberry will first provide a cocktail book and then request the player to prepare four different cocktails. Players can tradeHeckel Funchto purchase the alcoholic and fruit ingredients required.

Once players have completed the cooking and cocktail-making introduction, they can start running a delivery service aroundGielinor.

How to play[edit|edit source]

Gianne jnr. will give the player a new task in the form of adelivery box. The player may choose an easy task, which involves a delivery in or around theGrand Tree, or a hard task, which could be anywhere inGielinor. Easy tasks have a time limit of 6 minutes, whereas hard tasks have a limit of 11 minutes. Players can click the delivery box at any time to refresh their memory about the required food and destination. A player can choose to decline a hard job, but there is a 5 minute and 30 second waiting penalty before they can get another hard job. They can wait this out, or take and do an easy job, which can be up to twice as fast as waiting, and then return for another hard job.

Players who have capped out theirreward tokenreward at 10 pieces of gnome food, will not be able to quick-start a delivery mission anymore. However, this gives them the ability to ask for another order after receiving an order. Using this, it is possible to keep requesting a new hard job until one of the gnomes that gives a unique reward is selected, and then only doing those delivery jobs. This significantly increases the amount of valuable rewards that can be obtained through this minigame.

The delivered food must be prepared by a player. Premade versions, obtained fromGianne's RestaurantorBlurberry Barcannot be used. However, the player-made versionscanbe bought from theGrand Exchange, but beware as they may take a while to buy. It is not required to prepare each food item or drink separately after receiving a new task; therefore, it is recommended toprepare the items in advanceand store them in yourbank. One can then be assigned a task, withdraw the items required from the bank, deliver the order and teleport back to the Grand Tree (note that there is a bank just south ofGianne's Restaurant). This is a much easier method than making the order from scratch each time and saves a significant amount of time. If the player has completedMonkey Madness II, theroyal seed podis the fastest way to return to the Grand Tree, otherwise theAl KharidandEmir's Arenateleports from theamulet of gloryandring of dueling, and via thegnome glider, respectively, are very useful for returning to the Grand Tree.

Money making[edit|edit source]

The followingmoney making guideis available for Gnome Restaurant:

Method | Hourly profit | Skills

Delivering food in Gnome Restaurant | 1,222,299 | 4261

Rewards[edit|edit source]

For each delivery, the player is given a tip by the gnome customer. The speed of delivery does not influence the rewards given as a tip, as long as the delivery is made within the allotted time.[1]

Reward tokens[edit|edit source]

In addition to the tip, you receive points for completing a delivery, which are stored on areward token. Every easy delivery you make gives you one point. Hard deliveries earn three points. After you earn 12 points, you receive a reward token, which you can use to receive a free random gnome food item. After earning the token, every 12 points earned adds another food item to the delivery should you use the token.

You can have up to ten items of food delivered to you at once, as the token stores up to 120 points. When having food delivered, there is a small delay between using the token and receiving the food. You will need free inventory spots to hold the food.

Oncetentokens are received and unused, Gianne acknowledges your hard work and says you should go on vacation, or you may continue delivering just for tips. At this point, you can repeatedly re-roll your delivery target by simply asking for a new job at any time, regardless of your current job state. This makes acquiring unique items, such as the scarf, much easier.  (Still have to wait 5 minutes with full reward token)
