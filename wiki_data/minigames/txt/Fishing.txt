When a player has found afishing spot, they can then use their fly fishing rod if the option "lure fishing spot" is available.

Stripy feathers(introduced with theHunterskill) can be used for fly fishing, as well.

There are five types of harpoons - the regular harpoon, thebarb-tail harpoon, thedragon harpoon, theinfernal harpoon, and thecrystal harpoon. The dragon harpoon and infernal harpoon both have a 20% faster catch rate than the regular harpoon, and the crystal harpoon has a 35% faster catch rate. The barb-tail harpoon, dragon harpoon, infernal harpoon, and crystal harpoon can all be wielded. Many players prefer these harpoons as it saves aninventoryspace.

After being taught byOtto Godblessed, a player can catch fish that are harpoonable with just their hands. The Fishing level requirement is 20 levels higher and it also requires aStrengthlevel equal to the Fishing level needed to catch the fish normally, but a small amount of strength experience is gained and the player doesn't need a harpoon equipped or in their inventory.
