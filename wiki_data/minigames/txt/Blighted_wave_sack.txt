Ablighted wave sackwas an item purchased from theEmir's Arenareward shop. It allowed players to cast anywave spellswithout needing therunesfor it. However, it could only be used inside theWildernesswhile on thestandard spellbook.

The spell sack was consumed upon use, regardless of asuccessful hit.
