Map



TheMoons of Perilare threenaguaimprisoned inNeypotzli, a prison located beneathCam Torum. Aimed at mid-level players of at least level 75 combat, the Moons of Peril is heavily inspired by theBarrows.

During the time of theOld Ones, the Moons of Peril were summoned by a powerful shaman facing imminent death, and wished to inflict the same on others. Her companions disapproved, and created Neypotzli to imprison her and the three nagua, and summonedEyatlalli, a nagua of earth and stream, to keep them in check.

The Moons of Peril are popular for mid-level players due to their fairly generous resource rewards (especially for ironmen) and the armour sets. In particular, the blood moon set gives valuable melee strength bonus, serving as a stepping-stone towardsBandos armour.

Fighting the Moons of Peril requires having completed thePerilous Moonsquest, which acts as an introduction to Neypotzli and the bosses.

Ironmenare eligible for rewards from theLunar Chestwhen defeating the Moons of Peril alongside other players.

Fight overview[edit|edit source]

The player's trip intoNeypotzlibegins in the antechamber, expanding outwards along three accessible entrances. Each of these - the Streambound Cavern, Earthbound Cavern, and the Ancient Prison - have different resources where players can create food and potions that are more powerful than even the best found outside; as such, it is highly recommended to gather supplies from within these caverns rather than bringing in supplies from outside. Campsites around the three areas will also havesupply cratesthat store the required tools to gather resources, andcooking stovesto cook food and fully restorerun energy.

Once the player is ready, they can proceed to face the Moons of Peril; the three bosses share a unique mechanic where their basic attack will hit three times, each dealing more damage than the last; however, if one hit misses, the remainder will as well. This means having good defence bonuses will result in less damage taken overall.Protection prayerswill not do anything against any of their attacks.

While they can be fought by multiple players simultaneously, the boss' health is tied to individual players, meaning each player will effectively have to deal all damage on their own. Additionally, each Moon of Peril has a lower defence bonus against a specific melee style:

Eclipse Moon- vulnerable to stabBlue Moon- vulnerable to crushBlood Moon- vulnerable to slash
