InOld School RuneScape,itemsare physical objects that a player may have in theirinventoryorbank. Players distinguish them by their names and graphics. The game additionally seems to distinguish items byID numbersthat are not visible to players in-game.

Characteristics[edit|edit source]

Items can be described by a number of characteristics:

ID: All of the items inOld School RuneScapehave a unique number that identifies it, invisible to players in-game. Only one item has the same ID, unlike how multiple items can have the same name. The ID of an item can be used to lookupGrand Exchange pricesand get additional information about an item from the database, such as the examine text and value. Seemingly identical items may have different IDs as they are used for different purposes.Unobtainable items, such asHazelmere's book, exist within the game's code, have an ID number assigned to it, but are never seen via normal gameplay. Instead, they are found within the game's cache.Item IDs can be shown on this wiki by navigating to theuser preferencespage and enabling the "advanced data" gadget. The ID will then be shown on item articles at the bottom of the infobox.Graphics: All obtainable items have graphics. There are four main types of graphics items may have:All items may be held in theinventoryand therefore have inventory icons, restricted to a size of 36 x 32 pixels. The inventory icon also appears in theGrand Exchangebox and theequipment screen, albeit its outline and shadow may vary.Mod West showcases the program used to generate inventory icons.The inventory icon is not created individually from other models. Rather, it is generated by taking the model used when the item is dropped on the floor (as such, destroy-only items have models when dropped on the floor as well) and displaying it. Artists set the angle/rotation/translation that the model should be displayed at in the item's config file, and lets the game engine take care of the rest. However, the artists have no control over how the game engine decides what to render and what to ignore on a pixel level when dealing with small details within a model.The third kind of item graphic is equipment that is equipped on the player, which is a 3D model that is usually more detailed than the inventory/dropped appearance.A fourth appearance for items is an appearance in achatbox, such as when anNPCgives you an item, and it appears as a larger version of the inventory icon (with textures).In addition, some items may have graphics for other situations, such as animations,POHmountings, or the player's head when talking to an NPC. All of these graphics will usually look similar to each other, normally only varying in detail.Name: Most items have a unique name for that particular item. Some may have the same exact name, yet have different purposes.Items in-game useucfirstcapitalisation, wherein the first letter of a string is capitalised, but the rest is not. For example, as an inventory item,TzTok-Jad'spet is calledTzrek-jad, but as a follower it's calledTzRek-Jad.While items in-game can share the same name, such as "Key", every item has a distinct config name within the game's code. For example, the item "Key" used during theWitch's Housequesthas the config name "witches_shedkey", while the item "Key" used during theLost Tribequesthas the config name "lost_tribe_chest_key". These config names are used byJagex Moderatorsto more easily identify items when creating or fixing content.Tradeability: Many items may betradedbetween players; however, manyquest-related,holiday, and miscellaneous items cannot be traded (and cannot be transferred in any other way such as theParty Room) and therefore are often calleduntradeableitems or non-tradeables. Almost all tradeable items may be traded on theGrand Exchangeand therefore are associated with a certain price range of numbers ofcoins, which can change when the Grand Exchange updates its prices. The only tradeable items that cannot be traded on the Grand Exchange are a very small number of useless items such as burnt fish. Naturally, coins are an item that cannot be bought on the Grand Exchange either as they are the maincurrencyinOld School RuneScape.Weight: All unstackable items have weight which affects the player's ability torun. The higher a player's weight, the faster they lose energy while running.Item stacking(Stackability): Some items such asrunesorcoinswill pile up in a single spot in the inventory. Other items such asbucketswill take one spot per item and therefore are non-stackable. All items that are "stackable" have zero weight. Most non-stackable items may be converted to a stackable form using abank note, but bank noted items lose most of their properties as they just become a piece of paper. Bank noted items may be deposited in the bank and then withdrawn back as usable, unnoted, non-stackable items.Equippability: Some items, such asweaponsorarmour, can be worn, givingbonusesor penalties to differentcombat styles. Many equipped items also have other effects.Coin value:Items that can be sold to a shop or that can have thespellsHigh AlchemyorLow Level Alchemycast on them have a value determining the number of coins players will get if they do one of these actions. Even if an item is untradeable, it sometimes may still be converted into coins via alchemy spells. An example of an item falling under this category is a partiallydegradedpiece ofBarrows equipmentor theecumenical key.

Tradeability[edit|edit source]

Not every item inOld School RuneScapeistradeable, and of the items that are, not all can be listed for sale on theGrand Exchange. All items could be traded whenRuneScapewas first released, until a2002 updateintroduced the concept of untradeable items by barring players from trading certain quest items.

As a rule, tradeable items can be:

Traded to other players via thetrade interface.Picked up by other players if the item is dropped onto the ground for over a minute.Sold to ageneralorspeciality shop.HighorLow-alchemisedinto coins.Converted intonotes.

These properties do not apply to all tradeable items however, as amembership bondfor instance cannot be alchemised, despite being a tradeable item. They are also not exclusive to tradeable items; untradeable items may or may not be alchemiseable. In general, most tradeable items can also be listed for sale on the Grand Exchange. Numerous exceptions do exist, which are listed onGrand Exchange/Non-tradeable items.

Free-to-playaccounts cannot trademembers-only items with other players or sell them to shops, even if they are tradeable. Members' items can however be sold on the Grand Exchange, regardless of membership status or world type.

Dropping and destroying[edit|edit source]

A large number of items may be dropped on the ground through the right-click "Drop" option. How an item behaves once it is dropped depends on whether it is tradeable or untradeable. Tradeable items will become visible to other players one minute after being dropped to the ground, and disappear altogether after three minutes. This timer will keep ticking down if the player who dropped the item logs out, and will always stay on the same world it is dropped in. Dropped untradeable items however will not appear to other players, though they also despawn after three minutes. In contrast to tradeable items, untradeables are tied to the player who dropped them, and will appear in any world that player switches to. The despawn timer of these items is also paused while the player is logged out.

 | UIM deathpile | Untradeable | Tradeable

World location | Cross-world | Cross-world | Same world

Visible to others | Never | Never | After 60 seconds

Despawn timer | 60 minutes | 3 minutes | 3 minutes

Pauses on logout | Yes | Yes | No

That said, dropped item behaviour can diverge from these rules in certain circumstances. Perhaps most notably, nearly all items dropped in theWildernessbecome visible to other players immediately: this is to discourage players from dropping their items before dying and quickly travelling back to pick them up. The only exceptions to this are cooked foods and potions, which never appear to other players in the Wilderness, so as to prevent clans and teams from dropping supplies for each other during a fight.Chinchompasalso cannot be released in combat in the Wilderness, to prevent chinchompa hunters from releasing them out of spite and leaving nothing for the player killer. Items dropped onTutorial Islandwill disappear after only 30 seconds. Items placed on tables disappear after 10 minutes. Items dropped ininstancestend to have a much longer despawn timer, which is typically – but not always – set to three hours.[1]Clue scrollsof all tiers have a despawn timer of one hour when dropped, except when dropped in instances with increased despawn timers, where they will instead respect the despawn timer of that instance.

Players can allow potions and food items to form a supply pile on death by enabling the corresponding option in theSettings panel, which will cause these items to persist across worlds and suspend their despawn timer on logout as though they were untradeable.

There is a limit on the total number of items or item stacks that can remain on the ground within the same 8x8 tiles game chunk.[2]If more than 129 tradeable items are dropped within that area, additional ones will begin to replace items already lying on the ground.[3]The order of priority is determined by theGrand Exchange guide valueof the various items, which the lowest priced items being replaced first.[4]For item stacks, the value of the whole stack is taken into account when determining its priority.[5]Untradeable items and items that are part of a supply pile do not count towards this limit.

Some items have a "Destroy" option instead of a "Drop" option as part of their right-click interface, as is commonly the case forquest items,event rewards, and untradeable items in general. Destroying an item will make it vanish instantly, rather than first being cast to the ground. A chatbox message appears in most cases when the "Destroy" option is selected, prompting the player for confirmation, coupled with a short description of whether and how it may be reobtained.

Discontinuation[edit|edit source]

Unlike in its parent gameRuneScape, the team ofOld School RuneScapehave taken special care to prevent discontinued items. Allholiday itemsare able to be reobtained every year at their respective holiday dates. Whenever an item is in fact discontinued, (e.g., thecabbage rune,kristmas kebab, and various other in-progress holiday event items), if the player has any of those items, they are removed from wherever they are stored.

InRuneScape, discontinued items can fetch billions ofgold pieces. Although theOld Schoolteam was at first unsure whether or not to repeat the behaviour of discontinuing holiday items and letting prices inflate, ultimately they decided, like Andrew Gower did in 2003, "players hoarding huge numbers of the gifts we drop and then reselling them for massively unfair prices [...] isn't really in the spirit of the occasion."[6]Given a fresh slate, theOld Schoolteam has been able to avoid that legacy mistake.

Categories[edit|edit source]

Longest item names[edit|edit source]

Historically, item names inRuneScapecould not exceed a certain amount of pixels.[7]As a result, the longest item names prior to the launch ofOld School RuneScapedid not exceed 20 characters. This limit was lifted sometime after the launch of theNightmare Zone, where the itemanti-dragon shield (nz)surpassed the limit at 23 characters. Due to anUpdateon June 1st 2023, Members' Items are now visible in Free to Play worlds with "(Members)" as a suffix, thusCorrupted morrigan's leather chaps (bh)(inactive)(Members)may take the lead. However the actual item name did not change leaving this open to interpretation.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

If one selects the option to "take" an item, and the item disappears before reaching it (or picking it up), a message that says "Too late - it's gone!" will show in the chat box.Items in the inventory will remain there even if the player is wielding them in an animation, such as an axe when chopping a tree.The maximum amount of an item the player can have on an interface (bank,inventory,Grand Exchangeslot, etc) is 2,147,483,647 due to the amount being stored as a signed 32-bit Integer. In the Java programming language, an integer has a maximum value of 231- 1 or 2,147,483,647, per the definition of a Java integer as 32 bits.
