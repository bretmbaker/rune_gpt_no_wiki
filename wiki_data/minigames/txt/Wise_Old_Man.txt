Dionysius, also known as theWise Old Man, is a legendary and very powerfulSaradoministwizard and former adventurer, currently residing inDraynor Village. Under his judicious alias, Dionysius, he is infamous for theDraynor bank robbery. He wears light brown robes, a regularblue cape,partyhat & specs, and wields a shortstaff.

When asked, he will tell you about all the adventures he had throughoutGielinor. He also offers a service to remove quest items or "junk" from your bank, a full list of which can be foundhere. Lastly, he can also assignvarious tasksonmemberworlds and give small rewards in return if the player asks him, "Is there anything I can do for you?"

He also attended the2018 Birthday event, where he could be seen with several other iconicOld School RuneScapeNPCs.

Players can purchase theQuest point capeand theQuest point hoodfrom him for 99,000coins, once they have completed allquestsin the game, which is a total of 321Quest points. A reason why he sells theSkillcapecan reflect on how the flashbacks of his adventures that he shows to the player are very similar to cutscenes that the player has encountered before, but with the quest's respectiveNPCs.

When the dialogue option is clicked to check for junk he will request your bank pin number to access the "Wise Old Man's Recycling Centre". Doing so will bring up unusable or otherwise worthless items most likely from completed quests in which you can remove from your bank all at once. Some may find it very helpful to clean up some space without having to find out whether it has to be used in future quests.

History[edit|edit source]

Early History[edit|edit source]

In his youth, Dionysius (then called the Wise Young Man) was a hero who roamedGielinorto help those in need. One of these heroic feats was assisting theKeldagrimBlack Guardin driving out a group of rogue ice trolls led byMotherwho attempted to storm the city. Mother's group would eventually settle inWeiss, vowing revenge on their sworn enemy.

Some of his travels in his youth included theKalphite Lair, where he fought theKalphite Queen;Sophanem, where he vaporised aDrunken DwarfwithSaradomin Strike; battlingDadin the arena; killing anogre shaman; and battlingThe Shaikahan.

Getting Older[edit|edit source]

As he grew older, Dionysius began to feel bitter that he had not been "adequately" rewarded. By this time, he had taken residence in a small house inDraynor Village.

His most notorious act was therobbing of the local bank, killing several people in the process. One can watch the robbery's recording by speaking to the guard outside the bank - free for the first view, and a fee of 50 coins afterwards. One of these unfortunate victims, a'player'namedElfinlocks, dropped a blue partyhat, which the Wise Old Man claimed for himself due to its rarity and visual appeal.

He plays a small role infreeing Sir Amik Varzefrom theCulinaromancer, where he provides the player with aBook on chickensto help them locate theEvil Chicken.

The Ring of Charos[edit|edit source]

The adventurer, tasked byEllamariato grow a garden for herhusband, was unsure of where to start as she demanded that the seeds be gathered through persuasion. They visited Dionysius, who was surprised that she had sent them on an errand and gave them a short story about her past. Upon learning that they possessedCharos' ring, he told them about Charos' powers. He agreed to reactivate the ring, but only if they could prove that they had a knack for diplomacy. Once the adventurer passed his test, he enchanted the ring and sent them off.

Swan Song[edit|edit source]

Herman Caranoswould encounter an adventurer, who helped them repel a sea troll raid just as they were conversing. Unsure that they could handle the threat alone, he tasked them with bringing Dionysius to thePiscatoris Fishing Colony. The adventurer visited Dionysius and he was surprised that people still remembered his good deeds, deciding that it would be his final adventure. Upon arriving and repelling the trolls, Dionysius tasked the adventurer with finding an army after the colony's leader,Arnold Lydspor, sent most of the colonists away for their own safety. He told them to seek outWizard Frumsconeand to use his zombies, but Frumscone was unable to fulfil the request because everyone would keep asking him for zombies if he helped them.

Frumscone told the adventurer to look forMalignius Mortifer, who made them the army that the Colony needed. With the army ready, Dionysius and the adventurer battled the sea trolls. ASea Troll Generalsoon appeared, who Dionysius disposed of easily. However, aSea Troll Queenthen attacked him, dealing 254 damage but did not lower his health in the slightest. Despite the "weak" hit, Dionysius claimed to be too wounded and the adventurer was forced to battle the Sea Troll Queen alone, eventually killing it. He teleports back to his house afterwards, with the adventurer disappointed that they did not get his partyhat.

Saving the World[edit|edit source]

Dionysius would later be recruited byAeonisig Raispherafter learning of a new draconic threat by theDragonkinZorgothand his creationGalvek. Dionysius would participate in the battle, fighting alongsideBrundt the Chieftainagainst ared dragon, which the adventurer assisted in killing.

Along with the other heroes, Dionysius would assist the adventurer in taking out amithril,adamantandrune dragon. He and the others would later protect them from twobrutal black dragons. When the adventurer slew Galvek, he congratulated them for their heroic feat.

A Strange Quest[edit|edit source]

Dionysius makes a small appearance inMaking Friends with My Arm, whereOdd Mushroomtells the adventurer why the trolls of Weiss hate him. The adventurer recruits Dionysius to create a ploy to trick Mother into allowingMy Armto marrySnowflake. He initially declines as he is not a family mediator, but accepts when the adventurer reminds him that they owe him one for saving him from the Sea Troll Queen. He tells them to create a coffin and areduced cadava potion, which he drinks and is soon placed in the coffin.

My Arm presents him to Mother, who is suspicious because the two lack battle wounds. The ploy fails when Dionysius starts snoring, then passes gas, enraging Mother and sends him, the adventurer, My Arm, Snowflake and Odd Mushroom into jail. Dionysius assists the adventurer againstDon't Know WhatandMother, partying with them after Mother is killed by the adventurer.
