ThePenance Queenis thebossmonster of theBarbarian Assaultminigame. She spawns in Wave 10 25 ticks after all monsters are killed (which the game checks for every 10 ticks starting from the beginning of the wave), or 4 minutes after the wave starts, whichever comes first. She usesrangedattacks in rapid succession that can easily hit up to 13, and simultaneously strikes all players fighting her. Hermeleeattack can also hit up to 13. Players may not useprotection prayerswhilst fighting her. She can easily wipe out a whole party of players, especially if there is no cooperation between team members.

She can only be harmed byomega eggs, which are made through a 4-step process and shot from the egg launcher. It takes at least 8 omega eggs to take her down.

Upon defeating her, players will receive 80honour pointsin their chosen class, as well as 5 points in all other classes. Killing the Penance Queen is also a requirement to purchase some of therewards. Players have a 1 in 1,000 chance to receive apet penance queenwhen choosing to spend 500 honour points and a queen kill on ahigh level gamble.

Since the Queen is located within a "safe" activity, you will not lose any items if you die when fighting her, though you will have to restart the wave.
