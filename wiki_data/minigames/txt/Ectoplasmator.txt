This item can not be taken into Soul Wars.

It has a similar effect to thebonecrusherandash sanctifier, yielding Prayerexperienceupon killingspectralcreatures, equal to 20% of the monster's max health, rounded down. This does not restoreprayer pointsin theCatacombs of Kourend, as the Catacombs only grant prayer points for bones.

The ectoplasmator stacks with thebonecrusherwhen killing a spectral monster that also dropsbones, likeankou.
