Glistening tearsare a form of currency found in theUnderwater Agility and Thievingtraining activity, located in theUnderwatersection ofFossil Island. Glistening tears can be exchanged withMairinfor experience inAgility,Thieving, or both, and are obtained by lootingchestsandclamsduring the activity. Glistening tears are always obtained alongside amermaid's tear. Approximately 150 tears are obtainable per hour.

The most efficient way of exchanging glistening tears is selecting both skills. While it gives less experience in an individual skill, its value is higher than training the two skills independently, due to Agility being proportionally slower to train.

Players can only exchange a maximum of 700 glistening tears at once; if players exchange them for experience with more than 700 glistening tears in the inventory, the excess will bediscarded. In addition, they cannot be deposited into abank.

Choosing Agility and Thieving, the experience granted by each Glistening Tear is defined by the following equations; When exchanging for one skill, experience is multiplied by 1.5:[1]

EA⌊0.1⌋=3×A2×910150=0.018×A2ET⌊0.1⌋=11×T2×910150=0.066×T2

EAis Agility experience; ETis Thieving experience; A is Agility level; T is Thieving level.
