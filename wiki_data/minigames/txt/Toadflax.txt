Toadflaxis a low levelherb, requiring level 30Herbloreto clean. It can be acquired fromRandom eventsor grown with aFarminglevel of 38, by plantingtoadflax seedsinherb patches. It can also be acquired by trading in 3vouchersfrom theBrimhaven Agility Arenaor as a reward fromTemple Trekking. It is used to makeagility potions, and most commonly,Saradomin brews. To create a potion, you need to add the cleaned herb to avial of waterto create atoadflax potion (unf), and then add the secondary ingredient.

Using Toadflax in the coconut milk basedAntidote+ potionis often considered a waste, asAntidote++is vastly preferred by PvM'ers, whereas the Antidote+ is not usually in demand. However, Antidote+ can be a viable and cheaper option in certain situations, such as fending offpoisonwhile trainingRangedorMagicat theSkeletal MonkeysonApe Atoll. Ironmen may also prefer to create Antidote+ until they reach a high enough level to create its more potent counterpart.

According to the bookGielinor's flora - herbs, the flowers of a toadflax plant are often believed to resemble a toad's mouth, which is likely where it got the name. In addition, it is often mistaken forsnapdragonand is widespread in rural spots.
