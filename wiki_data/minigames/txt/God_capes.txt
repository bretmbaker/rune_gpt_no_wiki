[Minigame: God_capes]

God capesare a set ofMagiccapesthat can be awarded from theMage Arena Iminiquest. After defeatingKolodionin all four of his forms, the player can speak to him and step through the sparkling pool and pray to one of threegods:Saradomin,Zamorak, orGuthix. All god capes have the same stats, so choose based on which staff is required the desired spell or based on God Wars alignment (Guthix is not involved with theGod Wars Dungeon). After praying to a god, the corresponding cape will appear at the statue's feet and it may be picked up. The cape can be picked up multiple times to receive multiple capes.

The three types of god capes are:

Saradomin capeZamorak capeGuthix cape

Wearing a god cape with the correspondinggod staffcan allow you to cast the spellCharge, which boosts the damage ofgod spellby 50% for seven minutes (with a boosted maximum hit of 30).

God capes offer the second highest Magic Attack bonus of any cape, outclassed only by their imbued variants. God capes require a Magic level of 60 to wear.

Once lost, a player can get a new cape by once again praying at the statue without needing to fight Kolodion again. It may be a good idea to grab multiple capes (from the same statue). Alternatively, players can purchase any one of the three capes fromPerdufor 23,000 coins.

It is an essential of the corresponding god staff you choose also by talking to theStaff Trader.

Imbuing[edit|edit source]

Players with level 75 in Magic can imbue a god cape by taking aJusticiar's hand,Ent's rootsand aDemon's hearttoKolodionduringMage Arena IIminiquest. After the quest, players can obtain more imbued capes by simply bringing the respective component of the god cape that they wish to imbue; it is not necessary to kill all three god followers again to make another imbued cape. Alternatively, players can purchase any one of the three capes fromPerdufor250,000.

The imbued capes are:

Imbued saradomin capeImbued zamorak capeImbued guthix cape
