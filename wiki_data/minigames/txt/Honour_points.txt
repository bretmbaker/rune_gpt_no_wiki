Honour pointsare a set of four virtualcurrenciesused byBarbariansat theBarbarian Outpostto sellvarious armour, weapons, and Barbarian Assault role level upgrades, one for each Barbarian Assault role. They are not a physical item, but rather a reputation that a player can receive through defeating waves ofPenanceinBarbarian Assault. In addition, a fifth virtual currency -Queen kills- is required for some of the rewards; these are obtained by completing the tenth wave.

The number of points a player possesses can be checked by talking toCommander Connadat the Barbarian Outpost. After each wave is complete, the player will receive a number of Honour points based on their team's performance in battle. The team members will be presented with an interface indicating the amount of points awarded to the individual and to whichrole; the player will also have the choice tolevel upin that role if they have the required amount of points to do so. After completion of the 10th wave you will receive 80 points in your current role and 5 in the others. Upon completing the 10th wave you will be automatically reset to wave 1.

The maximum number of honour points a player can have at once is 5,000 points per role, while queen kills are limited to 40.

Using honour points[edit|edit source]

Players can exchange honour points for various rewards, one of the most desirable of which is thefighter torso. Other pieces ofarmourcan be purchased that can fill niche roles for certainaccount builds(for example, pures or artificially limited accounts). Players can also gamble their points for a chance at the rarePet penance queen.
