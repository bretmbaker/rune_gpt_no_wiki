Map



Thecombat ringis an arena in theShayzien Encampment. In the combat ring, the player may engage inmeleeduels with progressively higher tiers of soldiers to obtain pieces ofShayzien armour. Defeated soldiers will drop a piece of armour based on the tier they belong to. The player must obtain a complete set of armour from the preceding tier before they can challenge the next highest tier of soldier. In other words, the player must defeat theSoldier (tier 1)five times to earn a complete set ofShayzien armour (tier 1)before they can challenge theSoldier (tier 2). Soldiers will not drop duplicate armour pieces until after the player has obtained the complete set from that tier.

If a piece of armour is lost or destroyed prior to obtaining a full set of the next highest tier, the player will be required to defeat the previous tier of soldier again to reobtain a full set. Any armour pieces stored in the player'sbankorplayer-owned housewillcount toward the challenge requirements in the combat ring.

Duels are initiated by talking to the soldier that the player intends to challenge. It is possible to run away from the combat area during the fight to end the duel.
