Farmingis askillin which players plantseedsand harvest crops. The crops grown range fromvegetables,herbsandhops, to wood-bearingtrees,cacti, andmushrooms. The harvested items have a wide variety of uses, and are popular for trainingHerbloreandCooking. Many players sell their harvest for a significant profit. The plants grown infarming patchesare accessible only to the player who grew them.

Planted crops grow according to set timings, continuing even after a player logs out. This makes it possible to gain large amounts of experience from little in-game time, especially when growing high-experience crops such as trees. Players can also gain rapid experience by planningfarming runsthat maximise the number of plants grown at once.

General overview[edit|edit source]

The first thing any player will do when they begin training this skill is to rake away theweedsfrom one of the manyfarming patchesfound scattered aroundRuneScape. Once cleared, players have the option of applying compost to the patch, which will decrease the chance of the crop becoming diseased, and will also possibly increase the yield of the crop once it reaches maturity.

Compost[edit|edit source]

Compostcan be bought in farming shops, or obtained by placing a total of 15 weeds or various other unwanted vegetables into one of thecompost bins.Supercompost, which results in an even higher yield and further lowers chances of disease, is obtained by filling the compost bin with higher level Farming produce such aspineapples,watermelons,calquats,coconuts, and high endherbs.Ultracompostmay be made by adding 25volcanic ashesto a full bin of supercompost or adding two volcanic ashes to a bucket of supercompost. Players can also cast theFertile Soilspell from theLunar spellbookat any point during the plant's growth cycle to apply the effects ofsupercompost.

Obtaining seeds[edit|edit source]

Seedscan be bought from players and stalls, stolen viaThievingor obtained as drops from an enormous variety of monsters. Any lower or intermediate level seeds are usually very cheap, ranging from 1-20 coins each, while the higher level seeds, such astree,fruit tree, and especially upper endherb seedscan be costly as they are harder to procure and their usage yield high Experience and/or valuable harvested items.

Growth and disease[edit|edit source]

After growing for a preset period of time crops will mature and can then be harvested, provided that the crops have not become diseased and died while growing. Once planted, crops grow even if the player is not online, so one can plant aseedand come back at any time. Once the crops are fully grown they will remain in the patch indefinitely until harvested; that is, they will not die once fully matured.

However, during this time crops have a chance to becomediseased, and die if left unattended in this stage. While players may wish to check on their crops and cure diseased ones, this can prove a time intensive process. Use of supercompost or ultracompost significantly reduces disease risk. To guarantee plants reaching maturity, players can pay nearbygardenersto watch crops.

Gardeners all charge for their services, but not in coins. The price that they ask depends on the crop that the player asks them to watch. For example, the price for protecting a patch ofpotatoesis two buckets of compost while the price for protecting a patch ofonionsis onesack of potatoes. They will also accept your payment-items in noted form. Gardeners cannot be paid to protect herbs or flowers. After completing theEasy Kourend & Kebos Diary, the allotment, flower, and herb patches there will be protected by the local farmer at all times. Players can also unlock two herb patches which are perpetually protected from disease, for free, by completingMy Arm's Big AdventureandMaking Friends With My Arm.

Farming equipment[edit|edit source]

Tools[edit|edit source]

For farming, there are certain tools you will need to use, whether it's using araketo clear a patch or digging up dead plants with aspade. Below is a table of the basic tools and their uses.

Item | Description

 | Rake | Used for getting rid ofweedsin a plot.

 | Spade | The most useful Farming tool. Used for harvesting crops, clearing away dead plants and removing plant roots and bushes.

 | Watering canGricoller's can | Used for watering plants, which prevents disease during the watered growth cycle. Also used to water tree seedlings.Gricoller's canholds 1000 uses of water instead of 8.

 | Seed dibber | Used for planting seeds in a plot or farming patch.

 | Gardening trowel | Used to fill plant pots with soil, as well as planting tree seeds in plant pots to grow saplings.

 | SecateursMagic secateurs | Used for cutting away diseased leaves from trees and bushes.Magic secateursincrease most variable yields when worn or in the inventory.

 | Basket | Used for storing up to 5 pieces of fruit (Tomatoes, Strawberries, Oranges, Apples, Bananas).

 | Empty sack | Used for storing up to 10 vegetables (Potatoes, Cabbages, Onions).

 | Empty plant pot | Most often leftover after planting a sapling in a tree or fruit tree patch; needs to be refilled before use.

 | Filled plant pot | Used along with a trowel to plant tree seeds, which, when watered, produce tree saplings that may then be planted in patches.

 | Plant cure | Cures a diseased plant (other than trees and bushes).

Most of these tools can be bought in the severalFarming shops.

Atool leprechauncan be found at any farming patch. Their job is to look after the player's farming tools.

Players can store the following:

1-100Rake1-100Seed dibber1-100Spade1-100Trowel1-100secateursormagic secateurs1watering can(8) orgricoller's can1Bottomless compost bucket1-1000plant cures1-1000buckets1-1000compost,supercompostandultracompost

Thetool leprechaunwill also swap herbs (both grimy and clean) and harvested produce (with someexceptions) intobank notesform by using the unnoted items on the tool leprechaun.

Magic secateurs[edit|edit source]

Magic secateursare obtained during the questFairytale I - Growing Pains. It is the onlyweaponin game that is capable of damagingTanglefoot. When equipped or in the inventory, the magic secateurs increase the crop yield of herbs, allotments, grape vines, and hops by 10%, as well as yielding more higher quality herbs fromHerbiboars.

They are not considered a weapon when travelling toEntrana, as there is ahops patchon the island. Additionally, because of the stab and slash bonuses, they can be an alternative to theDramen staffon the island when usingMelee.

Farmer's outfit[edit|edit source]

TheFarmer's outfitis anexperience-boosting setthat grants bonus Farming experience when worn. A Farming level of 34 is required to wear any of the pieces, as pieces of the outfit are purchased from theTithe Farmshop. The outfit costs a total of 400 points to purchase.

 | Item | XP Boost | Cost (in points) | Boost per point(% per point)

 | Hat | 0.4% | 75 | 0.0053

 | Torso | 0.8% | 150 | 0.0053

 | Boots | 0.2% | 50 | 0.0040

Sub-total | 2%

Set bonus | 0.5%

Complete set | 2.5 % | 400 | 0.0063

Amulet of nature[edit|edit source]

The untradeableamulet of natureis used to monitor the state of a patch. Players can use it on a patch to bind the amulet to the selected patch. The amulet will remain bound to the same patch even after the plant is harvested or removed.

Players wearing the amulet will receive a message if the plant becomes diseased, finishes growing or dies. The message will be received upon log-in if it occured while the player was logged out. The amulet can also be rubbed to learn the current state of the patch.

Players can only have one amulet of nature at a time, but it can be rubbed and bound to new patches indefinitely.

Seeds[edit|edit source]

Seedsare items that members use to grow crops with the Farming skill. They are essential in training the Farming skill. There are various ways in retrieving them, for example:

PickpocketingMaster Farmers.Stealing fromSeed stalls.Monster drops.Bird nestsobtained during Woodcutting or frombird houses.CompletingFarming contracts.Hunting certainimplings, most notablyNature implings.Minigame rewards, such as various seeds from theWintertodtreward cartandBarbarian Assault gamblesorgrape seedspurchased fromTithe Farm.Low level seeds can be bought fromOliviaandAmelia.Purchasing from other players.Picking avegetablefrom one of the non-player-owned fields dotted around RuneScape occasionally provides a seed as well.

Disease, payment, compost and watering[edit|edit source]

When a healthy crop ends a growth cycle, there is a chance it may become diseased. While diseased, the crop stops growing and does not advance to the next stage. Crops do not recover from disease on their own, and die at the end of the diseased cycle if left uncured. Dead crops yield no experience and require use of a spade to dig up their remains before planting another crop in the patch.

Players may treat plants in diseased herb, flower, allotment, bush, hops, tree, fruit tree, hardwood tree, spirit, celastrus, belladonna, cactus, and mushroom patches withplant cureto restore the crop to health. Doing so may let the crop advance to the next growth stage normally upon the end of the cycle, although it is possible that it may become diseased again. For diseased trees and bushes, the player may usesecateurson the plant to trim the diseased branch and restore the crop to health. Alternatively, if a player has access to theLunar Magicspellbook they may use theCure Plantspell instead, which is substantially more expensive but may save the player valuable inventory space during afarming run.

Crops grow in real-time, so they may become diseased when a player is offline. In addition, crops that have been cured of disease may become afflicted once again. Crops cannot become diseased in the first growth stage (i.e. immediately after the seed has been planted), and fully grown crops will not become diseased.

Anamulet of naturealerts a player to disease occurring in a specific patch if worn, and may also be rubbed to check whether or not a plant is still healthy.

Reducing disease risk[edit|edit source]

Each crop type has a predetermined probability of becoming diseased each crop window. Treating a farming patch withcompost,supercompostorultracompostbefore (or immediately after) planting a crop reduces the chance of disease during all growth cycles, rounded down to the nearest 1/128th. Compost reduces disease risk by 50%, supercompost by 80%, and ultracompost by 90%. If anIasoris planted and alive, disease risk of all crops is reduced by a further 80%,[1]to a minimum chance of 1/128 per growth cycle. The risk of a plant becoming diseased without any treatment varies depending on the crop (and in some cases the specific patch).

Watering allotment, flower, and hops patches with awatering canreduces the risk of disease occurring at the end of that growth cycle.[2]During the next growth cycle, the plant changes from being watered back to normal and has a higher risk for disease once more, unless it is watered again. Only allotment, flower, and hops patches may be watered.

Eliminating disease risk[edit|edit source]

Planting differentflowersor ascarecrowprovides protection from disease to a variety of crops in allotment patches once the flower is fully grown, whilewhite lilliesprotect every type of crop grown in allotment patch.

Allotment,Hops,Bush,Tree,Fruit treeand some special farming patches allow you to eliminate disease risk entirely by paying one of thefarmersnear thefarming patchto watch over it and ensure that it grows to completion. Payment may be noted, but must be in the exact form requested. For instance, a farmer does not accept fiveapplesin lieu of abasket of apples. Visit the page linked below for a list of payments required to protect each seed.

CompletingMy Arm's Big AdventureandMaking Friends with My Armunlocks special herb patches that are immune to disease, although herb yields may still be increased by treating the patches with super/ultracompost.With completion of theEasy Kourend & Kebos Diary, the Hosidius allotment, herb, and flower patches will no longer become diseased.With the elite tier of theFalador Diarycomplete, the tree patch inFalador Parkwill no longer become diseased.Accruing 16,000gloryin a run at theFortis Colosseumwill cause the herb patch outsideCivitas illa Fortisto become disease-free.

Compost[edit|edit source]

Besides reducing the chance of a farming patch becomingdiseased,compost,supercompostandultracompostalso increase the minimum yield and maximum number of harvests received fromallotments,hopsandherbs.[3]This also applies togiant seaweedpatchesunderwater[4]andcelastrus barkfrom a fully growncelastrus seed[5]. It should be noted that this only works for one set of seeds. Once the crops are harvested, another bucket of compost must be applied to the patch in order to receive its effects.

Visit the page linked above for instructions on how to make the different tiers of compost.

Crop types[edit|edit source]

Crops and trees can be farmed in allocated farming patches, which can be found in several places. All farming patches are divided into a category, therefore seeds can only be grown in certain patches.

Allotment, flower, and herb[edit|edit source]

 | This article has astrategy guide.All information on mechanics and strategy will be on this page.

Allotment, flower, and herb patches are often found together as 2 allotment patches, 1 flower patch, 1 herb patch, and acompost bin.

An additional single allotment patch can be found onHarmony Island, which can be accessed after completingThe Great Brain Robbery. Also, additional herb patches can be accessed atTrollheimafter completingMy Arm's Big Adventure, inWeissafter completingMaking Friends with My Armand building theFire of Nourishmentand onHarmony Islandafter completion of the eliteMorytania Diary.

Allotments are used to grow certain fruits and vegetables that are often used in theCookingskill. Each allotment crop requires three seeds to be planted in each patch. Players can pay a nearby gardener to protect their crops, but must do so separately for each patch, even if two are available. Having fully-grown flowers of the corresponding type will protect adjacent allotment patches from getting diseased for as long as the flowers are in the patch, as an alternative to paying a gardener to protect the patch.

Fully grown allotment patches can be harvested by clicking on the fully grown crops; harvests are generally between 3 and 56 crops. After a patch has been harvested, it is cleared for re-planting.

A single flower seed is needed to plant in a flower patch; a fully grown flower protects specific allotment crops depending upon the flower's type. Flower patches cannot be protected by a gardener. Most flowers yield one flower when harvested, clearing the patch.Limpwurt seeds, at minimum, will yield three limpwurt roots. The yield can increase depending on the player's Farming level.[6]

A herb seed can be planted in a herb patch; as certain herb types are expensive, growing herbs with a high Farming level can be lucrative. Herb patches cannot be protected by a gardener. The herb patches at Trollheim and Weiss never become diseased, and the Hosidius patches are also protected if the player has completed theEasy Kourend & Kebos Diary. Harvests generally range between 3 and 18 grimy herbs. Usingultracompost,Farming capeandmagic secateurs, a player will gain an average of 9.5 grimy herbs when harvesting a herb patch.

Hops[edit|edit source]

 | This article has astrategy guide.All information on mechanics and strategy will be on this page.

There are fivehopspatches: north ofLumbridge, north ofMcGrubor's Wood, inYanille, onEntranaand onAldarin. Hops grown here can be used with theCookingskill forbrewing. Four hop seeds, or threejute seeds, are needed to plant in each hops patch. Harvests generally vary between 3 and 46 hops. After a hops patch has been harvested it will be cleared for re-planting.

Bushes[edit|edit source]

 | This article has astrategy guide.All information on mechanics and strategy will be on this page.

There are five bush patches: west of theChampions' Guild,Rimmington, south ofArdougne, south-west ofEtceteriaand in theFarming Guild. A player can check the health of and then harvest berries from fully grown bushes. This is done by hand and yields a minimum of four berries, with any extra berries depending on the player's Farming level. Unless a bush is dug up, it will continue to regrow berries over time.

Trees[edit|edit source]

 | This article has astrategy guide.All information on mechanics and strategy will be on this page.

There are six tree patches: atLumbridge,Varrock Castle,Falador Park,Taverley, theGnome StrongholdandFarming Guild. Players can grow trees by using a seed on aplant potfilled with soil to create aseedling. The seedling then needs to be watered. After a few minutes the seedling will turn into asapling, which can then be planted in a tree patch.

A fully grown tree acts similarly to the trees that are used in theWoodcuttingskill. After checking a tree's health, players can cut it down using anaxeto receive logs. As with non-player grown trees, there is a chance of a farmed tree droppingbird nests. Once a tree is cut down it will leave a tree stump, which can be left to respawn or dug up to gain tree roots and to clear the patch. Players who do not wish to cut down and dig up a tree can use the right-click "pay" option on the tree to instantly remove it. Gardeners can instantly remove a tree for a fee of200.

Fruit trees[edit|edit source]

 | This article has astrategy guide.All information on mechanics and strategy will be on this page.

There are six fruit tree patches: atGnome Stronghold, east ofCatherby, west ofTree Gnome Village,Brimhaven,LletyaandFarming Guild. Players can grow fruit trees by using a seed on aplant potfilled with soil to create aseedling. The seedling then needs to be watered. After a few minutes the seedling will turn into asapling, which can then be planted in a fruit tree patch.

Once a fruit tree is fully grown the player may check its health and harvest it to receive 6 fruit. A fruit tree will continue to grow fruit over time, unless it is cut down and its stump dug up, with a new fruit regenerating every 40 minutes. Gardeners can instantly remove a fruit tree for a fee of200.

Special patches[edit|edit source]

Some plants may only be grown in their specific patches. See the main article for more information on these plants and patches.

Farming Guild[edit|edit source]

TheFarming Guildis amembers-only guild located within theKebos Lowlandsjust north of theKebos Swamp. The guild is a large greenhouse separated into three tiers, with each tier requiring an increasing Farming level to enter (boostsmay be used for all tiers). Entering the guild requires a minimum Farming level of 45, the Intermediate tier requires level 65, and the Advanced tier requires level 85.

Farming contracts[edit|edit source]

Because the guild needs to rotate the crops they're growing to stop the soil from tiring due to a lack of nutrients,Guildmaster Janecan assignfarming contractsthat require the player to grow certain crops within the Farming Guild. Players who complete them are awarded withseed packs, which contain an assortment of seeds and can includeHespori,Celastrus, andredwood seeds.

There are three tiers of contracts available, with each tier being restricted based on their Farming level and their level of access within the Farming Guild. Boosts may be used to accept a farming contract you are below the level requirement for.

Hespori patch[edit|edit source]

The Hespori patch, accessible via the cave entrance, is a patch where players with 65 Farming can plantHespori seeds. These are randomly obtained when harvesting plants throughout Gielinor or rewarded from farming contracts. The Hespori plant cannot become diseased, and therefore does not need to be watered, composted, or protected by a farmer.

Once the patch has fully grown, which is indicated by the flower behind the cave sprouting open or by going into the cave and checking, theHesporican be fought as a solodemi-boss. Killing the Hespori boss grants Farming experience and seeds, including the uniquewhite lilyandanima seeds. It can also drop thebottomless compost bucket, which can hold up to 10,000 compost of any kind and doubles any compost added to it. In addition, it has a chance to give theTanglerootpet.

The Hespori fight isinstancedbut has an item reclaim service that works identically to other grave systems like theGrotesque Guardians,Zulrah, andVorkath. If the player dies during the Hespori fight,Arnowill collect and return their items for a fee of 25,000coins, but if they die in any dangerous area before doing so, any unclaimed items will be permanently lost.

Barbarian Farming[edit|edit source]

Barbarian Trainingis aminiquestthat allows players to expand their barbarian skills in the Farming skill. Completion of Barbarian Farming allows players to plantseedswithout aseed dibberand automatically destroyempty plant potswhen plantingtrees.

Tithe Farm[edit|edit source]

Tithe Farmis a Farming basedminigamethat is located inHosidius. The minigame revolves around intensively planting special seeds into farming patches, tending them until harvest, and depositing the produce into sacks in order to earn points. Players can speak toFarmer Gricollerfor information on how to play.

Requirements[edit|edit source]

Three types of seeds can be found on the table near Farmer Gricoller, each requiring a specific Farming level. Players can only take one type of seed, and boostscanbe used, but boosted levels must be maintained when planting seeds. When trying to enter without seeds, Farmer Gricoller will stop you.

Golovanova seeds(34)Bologano seeds(54)Logavano seeds(74)

Players will also need aspade, aseed dibberand awatering can(6 to 8 watering cans are recommended).

Rewards[edit|edit source]

After harvesting the plants, players should deposit the harvest into the sacks found nearby. Depositing harvests will reward players with points and Farming experience.

Rewards | Pointsrequired | Notes

 | Compost | 1 | Reduces chance of crops becoming diseased while growing throughout the plant cycle and increasing the minimum and maximum number of crops received upon harvest. The supercompost version is more potent.

This doesn't remove weeds that have already grown there, but it stops them from growing back.Once purchased, the ability can be turned on and off freely.Note: This doesn't affect farming patches involved inManaging Miscellania.

Mechanics[edit|edit source]

Growth timing[edit|edit source]

Crops do not grow continuously; each plant has a discrete set of growth stages, advancing to the next at periodic times calledgrowth ticks.[7]The frequency of growth occurring is determined by the type of seed, e.g. a spirit tree's growth stages last 320 minutes. In comparison, hops' growth stages last 10 minutes. The shortest is 5 minutes, which includes flowers, weeds growing and tree seedlings growing into saplings. For a full list of growth stage durations and the number of stages for each type of crop, seeSeeds. TheKronosplant provides a chance for farming patches (excluding itself) to skip a growth stage during their next growth cycle; this chance is shared between all farming patches of that growth cycle.

The pattern of growth ticks is shown in the table below. However, there is an offset of up to 30 minutes which isdifferent per player, and persists through logins.[8]To determine this offset, note the time when a slow crop grows, and compare with the next time listed. Then apply the difference to every time in the table. This offset is always negative, causing growth ticks to occur up to 30 minutes prior to the times listed here.[9]For example, if a mahogany tree grows at 10:28 AM on Day 1, subtract 12 minutes from each time listed.

Cycle length | Main crops | Base growth times (GMT, 12-hour) | Base growth times (GMT, 24-hour)

The time for a newly-planted seed to grow to the second stage is typically less than the full time between growth ticks. For example, herb seeds grow every 20 minutes. Suppose a player with zero offset plants a seed at 6:35. A growth tick for herbs will occur at 6:40, and the herbs then grow to the second stage, having spent five minutes in the first growth stage instead of the stated 20.

The following is a schematic representation of the growth ticks. The green bars represent the times when plants will grow. Each time a plant grows, all plants with shorter growth stages will also grow, so there is a time every 640 minutes when all plants grow simultaneously.

Variable crop yield[edit|edit source]

Herbs,allotments,hops,bushes,belladonna,cacti,limpwurt,celastrus, andgiant seaweedall produce varying amounts of items when you harvest them.

For herbs, allotments, hops, celastrus trees, and giant seaweed, the mechanism to determine how many items can be harvested is based on "harvest lives". A fully-grown patch initially has three lives, with additional lives when compost is used (one additional life for regularcompost, two forsupercompost, and three forultracompost).[10]Each time a crop is harvested, there is a chance of one of these lives being used, continuing until there are no more harvest lives and the patch becomes empty. The chance of a harvest life being saved is determined and can be increased in various ways:

Farming level and crop type: This determines the base chance to save a harvest life and is a function of both Farming level and what is being planted.[11][12]Generally speaking, the higher your Farming level, the higher the base chance to save. Additionally, the higher the Farming level requirement of the crop, the higher the base chance to save, with the caveat that this effect decreases with Farming level, converging to equal chances for all crops at level 99. Boosts above level 99 only affect the yield of limpwurt plants and belladonna.[13]Wieldingmagic secateursor having magic secateurs in your inventory while harvesting: *1.10Wearing theFarming capewhile harvesting: *1.05 (herb patches only, additive with secateurs bonus for a 1.15 total multiplier)Completing theKandarin Diary: +10 Medium, +17 Hard, +25 Elite (Catherbyherb patch only)Completing theKourend & Kebos Diary: +10 Hard (HosidiusandFarming Guildherb patches only)Having anattas seedplanted: *1.05

The unboosted chance to save a harvest life is given by

Chance to save (unboosted)=1+⌊CTSlow×(99−F)98+CTShigh×(F−1)98+0.5⌋256

whereFis the player's Farming level,CTSlowis the base chance for saving a life of the specific crop at level 1 Farming, andCTShighis the base chance for saving a life of the specific crop at level 99 Farming. WhileCTSlowandCTShighare fixed constants for each specific crop, it is generally true thatCTShighis the same across crop types; for instance,CTShigh=80for all herbs.

Boosts, such as themagic secateurs, improve the chance to save by increasing the constantsCTSlowandCTShigh. The three classes of boosts improve these constants as follows:

ItemBoost(CTS)=⌊CTS*(1+ItemBonus)⌋,DiaryBoost(CTS)=CTS+DiaryBonus,AttasBoost(CTS)=⌊CTS*(1+AttasBonus)⌋

where

ItemBonusis 0.1 withmagic secateurs, 0.05 withFarmingormax capes, for a total with 0.15 with both;DiaryBonusis 10, 17, and 25 for the Catherbyherbpatch following completion of the medium, hard, and eliteKandarin Diaryrespectively, and is 10 for the Farming Guild and Hosidius herb patches following completion of the hardKourend & Kebos Diary;AttasBonusis 0.05 if the player is currently growing anattas plantin theiranima patch.

The three bonuses are 0 by default. The improvedCTSlow/highvalues are then given by[14]

CTS‾low/high=AttasBoost(DiaryBoost(ItemBoost(CTSlow/high)))

so that the chance to save a harvest life for a given crop, accounting for boosts, is

Chance to save (boosted)=1+⌊CTS‾low×(99−F)98+CTS‾high×(F−1)98+0.5⌋256

The absolute minimum number of crops harvested is equal to the number of lives the player started with (for example, six with ultracompost), but there is no theoretical upper limit on the size of a harvest. Large harvests, however, are rarer; as the number of harvests which preserve a life follows thenegative binomial distributionNB(r=Harvest Lives,p=Chance to not save), the expected yield is

r+r(1−p)p=Harvest Lives1−Chance to save.

Average yield per crop type[edit|edit source]

 | This article or section is incomplete and could do with improvement.Reason:Ranges need to be recalculated based on known CTS values.You can discuss this issue on thetalk pageoreditthis article to improve it.

These averages depend on knowing the chance of a harvest life being saved, which is unknown for the majority of variable yield crops other than herbs, but can be estimated after numerous harvests.

The following estimates are based off of experimental findings (unless cited with exact numbers), and presuppose the use of both the magic secateurs and the Farming cape at 99 Farming with ultracompost:

Herbs give an average of 9herbsper patch.[12]Allotments give an average of 40–50 produce per patch.Bushes give an average of 15–20 berries per patch.Hops give an average of 30–40 hops per patch.Belladonna give an average of 8nightshadeper patch.Cactigive an average of 10spinesper patch.[15]Potato cactigive an average of 15–20potato cactiper patch.Celastrus trees give an average of 8-10 bark per patch.Limpwurts give an average of 8limpwurt rootsper patch.[16]Seaweed give an average of 33giant seaweedper patch.[17]

Farming pet[edit|edit source]

TheTanglerootis a skillingpetthat can be obtained when checking the health and harvesting the final crops of any fully grownfarming patch. It can also be obtained while playing theTithe Farmminigame, or from killing theHespori. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Farming level and the produce the player is harvesting.

Temporary boosts[edit|edit source]

Boost | Levelincrease | Visibility | Other info

 | Farming cape | 1 | Visible | When the farming cape is equipped,herb patcheswill have a 5% increase to the base chance to save harvest lives and gain extra herbs.
