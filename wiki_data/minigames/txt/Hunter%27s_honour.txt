TheHunter's Honouris a cosmetic hat that can be claimed fromCorrupted WarriorsinFerox EnclaveorDaimon's Crater, once players obtain one target kill in theBounty Hunterminigame.

The hat alters its appearance depending on the number of target kills (assigned target kills in theBounty Hunterminigame) and rogue kills (non-target kills on Bounty Hunter worlds) the player has; the Hunter's Honour is chosen if the player has more target kills than rogue kills, and theRogue's Revengeis chosen if the player has more rogue kills than target kills.
