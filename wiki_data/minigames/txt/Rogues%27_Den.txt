Map



TheRogues' Denis a hideout located beneath a trapdoor inThe Toad and Chickeninn inBurthorpe, containing a variety ofThievingandAgilityrelated activities. While there are no entry requirements, its main attraction is the Maze exploration minigame, which requires 50 Agility and 50 Thieving (unboostable). The maze is notable for offering a chance to earn pieces ofRogue equipment, which provide a chance to receive double loot fromPickpocketing. Wearing the full set guarantees double loot.

Outside of the maze there are several shops, a fire next to a bank, and four wall safes with a chance to provideuncut gemsup todiamondor 20 to 40coinswhen cracked open.

Wall safes[edit|edit source]

In the middle of the waiting room, there are four wall safes that players can attempt to crack. Successful attempts yield uncut gems (up to diamonds), 20 or 40 coins, making it a convenient way to obtain uncut gems, especially forironmen.

Tile markers guide•Data

The objective of the minigame is to get to the centre of the maze without getting caught in one of the many traps. Entering the maze requires level 50(not boostable)in both Thieving and Agility, and no items can be brought or worn inside.

Players must talk toBrian O'Richardto enter the maze before playing the first time; subsequent games can be started directly by entering the doorway. Upon entering the maze,Prayeris reduced to zero, andThievingandAgilityare set to their normal levels. Amystic jewelis placed in the inventory, which allows players to teleport back to the lobby at any time.

Navigating traps and obstacles in the maze reduces Thieving and Agility levels, respectively. These stats do not restore while inside the maze. If either skill would drop below zero, players are teleported back to the lobby.

At the end of the maze,wall safescan be cracked for a chance to receive unique rewards: aRogue's equipment crateor aRogue kit. Cracking the safe teleports players back to the lobby, where they also receive 12experiencein both Agility and Thieving for each level that has been drained from the respective skill.

If the maze is failed or otherwise left prematurely, only a fraction is rewarded of the 12xp per level drained, depending on distance into the maze at the moment of departure. Leaving the maze also restores Prayer, Thieving, and Agility to their normal levels.

Without using the level 80 Thieving shortcut, a single run can take about 3 minutes and 40 seconds to complete, assuming it began with 100%run energyand right after drinking a dose of astamina potion. With the level 80 Thieving shortcut, runs only take about 2 minutes to complete.

Note:As no items or gear are allowed inside of the maze, before entering, it is recommended to drink a single dose of a stamina potion and to drop or smash theempty vial.

Map[edit|edit source]

Traps and dangerous obstacles are shown in yellow on the map. You immediately leave the maze if you trigger a trap or touch a dangerous obstacle. Traps can be disarmed by searching them; this uses upThievingpoints. Some traps can be run past or over without triggering them, without using up Thieving points. This is referred to as the "run trick".

Less-dangerous obstacles are shown in green. You use up a certain amount ofAgilitypoints when you pass these obstacles. They are not dangerous unless you run out of Agility points, in which case you will fail them and immediately leave the maze. Watch your Agility points and make sure you have at least six (6) points remaining for the last two obstacles.

All doors in the maze are one-way: you can only pass them in one direction. This includes the doors to go to the viewing gallery and even includes the first door you use to enter the maze. Passageways, however, are two-way.

Legend

1 | Floor traps, including floor spikes and pressure pads. Disabling these traps drains your Thieving by 1.

2 | Spinning blades on pedestals. Cannot be disabled.

3 | Contortion Bars, agility obstacles which drain Agility by 5 and cannot be failed until you run out of agility.

4 | Pendulums, agility obstacles which drain Agility by 3 and cannot be failed until you run out of agility. Causes you to fall on the floor (cancels previous inputs)

5 | Wall traps. Disabling these traps drains your Thieving by 1.

6 | Ledges, either hand-hold ledges or bridges which drain Agility by 4 (7 for longest and final ledge) and cannot be failed until you run out of agility.

7 | Floor blades, drains Agility by 3 and cannot be failed until you run out of agility. Causes you to fall on the floor (cancels previous inputs)

8 | Areas patrolled byRogue Guardswho will kick you out of the maze if you get too close. There will be nearbyflash powdersto blind them and run past them while they can't see you.

9 | Moving blades hidden in walls (less-dangerous obstacles).

A | Entrance to the maze.

B | Locked doors. Players with level 80+Thievingcan pick the locks of these doors. The two locked doors in the west part of the maze open up a shortcut that is considerably quicker than the standard route.

C | This room with spikes protruding from the floor can be seen from the viewing gallery but apparently is not connected to any other part of the maze.

D | Flash powder, which can be used to temporarily blind rogue guards.

E | The threetilesmarked in yellow on the map are incorrect tiles and will not open the mosaic door.

F | The tile marked in red on the map is the correct tile for the door.

G | The mosaic door, which opens when the correct tile is inserted (see image below)

H | Grill room. There is only one correct path through the grills (shown on the map). The room is not dangerous, however, as choosing the wrong grills only results in you having to find your way back to the starting grill and trying again.

I | The "room of death". If you are okay forAgilitypoints, go along either of the side walls (you will automatically jump out of the way of the moving blades hidden in the walls). If you are running low on Agility, make your way across the floor traps (either searching them or running for short distances). Always avoid going anywhere near the spinning blades on the pedestals!

J | Eight wall safes, the objective of the maze. Open any one of them.

K | Two moving, spin-blade obstacles follow the path marked with yellow arrows on the map. The door in the western corridor blocks you from moving in the same direction as the spin blades. Instead, you must move in the directions indicated by the yellow arrows. You should run down these corridors and time your run to get into the side niches before a spin blade comes through. Note: These obstacles are not on the main path to get to the wall safes. You can take this route, but it is much longer to reach the safes this way. You do have to pass these obstacles if you want to get to the chest room.

L | Chest room. This room has many floor traps, so be careful. There are traps all next to the chest, but you can search a trap, disarm it, and have time to search the chest. However, be sure to search the trap to the front of the chest (the trap immediately west of the chest). Otherwise, when you go to search the chest, you will automatically move to this spot anyway. Almost all players regard the chest as a big waste of time, sinceit only yields 10 coins.

M | The gear door (not dangerous). You must solve a puzzle consisting of moving four gears to their correct positions for the door to open. You can keep trying as long as you like, and you can also just abandon the puzzle and go somewhere else without penalty. The gear door does not lead to any place interesting or rewarding.

Reward[edit|edit source]

At the end of the maze are wall safes that can be cracked in order to receive a reward. The wall safe opened has no effect on whether or not the attempt is successful.[1]

Players will also receive 12experienceper stat level drained in both Agility and Thieving. To maximize Agility experience players can jump back and forth at the last pendulum before the wall safe until the Agility level reaches between 0 and 5. At level 99 Agility and level 80 Thieving, up to 22k Agility xp per hour can be gained, along with a small amount of Thieving xp.

Players who successfully crack a wall safe are rewarded with one of the following items:

Rogue kit, which can be turned once into arope,chisel,tinderboxor aspade.Rogue's equipment crate, which allows the player to select one piece ofrogue equipment:Rogue mask(+5 to all defensive stats)Rogue top(+10 to all defensive stats)Rogue trousers(+7 to all defensive stats)Rogue gloves(+2 to all defensive stats)Rogue boots(+2 to all defensive stats)The player may alternatively choose to get a rogue kit from the crate.

Per piece of equipment worn, there is a 15% chance of pickpocketing twice the loot from anNPC. Wearing the full set instead guarantees the double loot. Experience drops remain unaffected.

Players can store the full set in theirarmour casein thecostume roomof theirplayer-owned house.

 | Chance forRogue's equipment crateeach attempt | Expected attemptsto crack a safefor full set

50 | 39.2% | 13

60 | 40.8% | 12

70 | 42.3% | 12

80 | 43.9% | 11

90 | 45.5% | 11

99 | 46.9% | 11

The percentage above includes failures to crack the safe as well as the chance of getting arogue kitinstead. As the success chance of a crack attempt is based on visible Thieving level, it will be influenced by any debuffs to your Thieving level suffered while navigating the maze. The calculations assume the player is taking no risks with the traps.
