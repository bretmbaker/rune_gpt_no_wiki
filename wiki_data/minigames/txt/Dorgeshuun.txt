[Minigame: Dorgeshuun]

TheDorgeshuun, often referred to ascave goblinsor the "lost tribe", are araceand tribe of subterraneangoblinsthat inhabit the tunnel network beneath southernMisthalin.Dorgesh-Kaanis their capital city, founded 2900 years ago.[1]Their name, in the ancient goblin language, translates to "Goblins of the Strong Spears."[2]

Since theThird Age,  the evolution of the Dorgeshuun and goblins on the surface had detracted significantly from each other as the Dorgeshuun needed to adapt to living underground in isolation. One of their defining attributes is their eye size: as the Dorgeshuun steadily evolved to be better suited to low-light conditions, their eyes grew larger to sense and perceive more light from what little they could get.[3]

The Dorgeshuun feature heavily in theDorgeshuun quest series: a set of fourqueststhat revolve around the tribe and its city. The series delve into the Dorgeshuun's history, society, and religion, as well as their interaction with the surface world andHumans Against Monsters.

Culture[edit|edit source]

While the vast majority of goblins on the surface are resoundingly slow-witted, disruptive to nearby inhabitants, and generally of a belligerent attitude, the Dorgeshuun demonstrate ingenuity, are civil, and are disinclined to engaging in warfare if it can be helped. The Dorgeshuun live in a complex society commensurate to that of other major races like theelves,gnomes,dwarves,humans, andvampyres: they have a working, healthy economy; a strong cultural identity and history with continued scholarship; a functioning and stable government of councils; highly-specialized and innovative technology; and a generally satisfied and active populace.

The Dorgeshuun came to be specialized in mining and digging tunnels and gained expertise in complex construction and civil engineering, as demonstrated by their grandiose city,Dorgesh-Kaan. They utilise an assortment of unique materials, one of which are bones forconstruction, for propping up their tunnels[4], and for other structures like their market stalls. Their city is adorned with theirmetal wireandlight orbsystem that acts as their lampposts, illuminating the underground complex. Their ability to use these light orbs and the specialmining helmetsthey wear for the tunnels also shows their proficiency infiremaking.

As necessity dictates, their cuisine also pivoted toward whatever underground critters were around, fromcave bug larvae,loaches,bats,frogs,slimyandcave eelstoSlayercreatures likeWall beasts,Cave slimes, andCave crawlers). Mushrooms also supplement their diet.

The Dorgeshuun are a pacifist race, and as such, their armaments (while unique) leave something to be desired.[5]Their weaponry consists entirely ofbone weapons[6]; and, even then, they are reserved for their guards and hunters as they're generally frowned-upon as items of war.[7]On the other hand, their combat skill and techniques may not be entirely lackluster. Given that their marketplace is filled to the brim with all manner of dangerous underground creatures served as dishes (ie.bigandgiant frogs, the poisonouscave crawlersandcave slimes, and the very aggressive and dangerouswall beasts), they are at least adequate hunters. They even have a technique for ambushing unsuspecting targets, (likely for hunting purposes only, but can also translate in warfare).[8]As far asmagicis concerned, however, the goblins lack even the basics to castWind Strike.[9]It's only after their opening to the surface world that the free-flowing trade and exchange of goods between Dorgeshuun and Lumbridge tourists exposed them torunesand their magical properties. Most notably,Oldakspends his time dabbling with runes and has developed "Moving-Over Distance Spheres": teleportation orbs that utilise crushed law runes in a glass sphere that teleport the user to a set location when shattered.[10]

There is an implied scholarship and academic body for the Dorgeshuun.[11]At the very least, the Dorgeshuun often display value of knowledge, discovery, and philosophy, exemplified inZanik's undying curiosity and appreciation of nuanced thinking[12][13], theGoblin scribe's passion for archiving and record-keeping (albeit a little undisciplined, as they take the player's word for their queries), as well as the goblins pushing back the construction of thedwarf-Dorgeshuun train tunnelinAnother Slice of H.A.M.in order to excavate archaeological artefacts of their ancestors.[14]Due to their mistreatment byBandosmillennia ago, the Dorgeshuun continue to hold a pessimistic view of the gods.[15]It can be purported that the Dorgeshuun have returned to their inherent pre-Bandos nature as goblins before his warmongering indoctrination, if whatHigh Priest Bigheadclaims is true.[16]They also do not believe in nor profess to know of an afterlife[17], unlike goblins on the surface.[18]

History[edit|edit source]

The Dorgeshuun tribe has a lineage that can be traced as far back as theGod Warsin theThird Age, where they were militarized along with other goblins to fight underBandos.[19][20]However, when the Dorgeshuun were sent off to fight elves and dwarves[21][22], they absconded from their mission, whether for want of self-preservation, pacifist ideals, and/or self-respect above being pawns for war.[16][23]So, the Dorgeshuun fled underground to evade punishment from their god for their failure and their weakness. There, they were sealed when an earthquake caused a cave-in that blocked off entry to their place of refuge until the breakout inThe Lost Tribe.[19][24]

Around 2900 years ago,Dorgesh-Kaan, was founded.[1]Yet, rule by martial might and other customs and traditions still persisted even then.[25]In continuation of what they knew and were familiar with, the leadership consisted of generals who were superseded by a successive general through defeat in combat[26]and a council of elders who advised those generals. However, the populace began inching further toward pacifism and civility, and they voted in favour of forming a republic headed by the council.[27][5]One of the generals,General Bonehelm, resisted relinquishing power to the republic and thus began acivil waramong the goblins.[28]He was forced out of Dorgesh-Kaan, where he constructed his own base in the caves nearby, then soon-after launched sieges against the city using archers mounted on giant frogs.[29]The violent conflict between the more sizeable army of the Republic and the more well-trained army of General Bonehelm saw the latter being repelled by the Dorgesh-Kaan defenders, forcing General Bonehelm and his army back to their base. Unfortunately for them, their mining of the tunnels to construct their base had compromised the integrity of the caves surrounding it, causing a great cave-in and collapse on the base due to the vibrations from the mass footsteps of the army. It was thereafter that the Dorgeshuun became a predominantly pacifist culture and saw their grand city flourish under unity.[30]

Dorgeshuun Quest Series[edit|edit source]

InThe Lost Tribe, the player helps in discovering the Dorgeshuun goblins when they accidentally breach theLumbridge cellar. The player makes contact with the Dorgeshuun cave goblin miner,Mistag, who reassures that their kind mean no threat. Furthermore, the player discovers that the advisor toDuke HoracioofLumbridge,Sigmund, was attempting to incite an unjust war and the annihilation of the goblins by stealing Lumbridge property and pinning the blame on them. When this is discovered, the Duke banishes Sigmund from his services. In subsequent quests, the player continues to play a key role in thwarting the hostile schemes of theHumans Against Monstersgroup, which seeks to eradicate all manner of creatures they find intolerable to humanity and of which Sigmund is an authority figure in. Currently, it seems that goblins are at the forefront of the creatures they most desire wiped out.

Outside matters of H.A.M., the player also helps the Dorgeshuun to establish relations with the greater world outside of their cave system, such as with Lumbridge and Keldagrim, along with helping to reveal more about their history and aboutZanik's possible role in theChosen Commanderprophecy.  In doing so, much is learned about the general history of goblins, their home realm ofYu'biusk, and their religious worship of Bandos.
