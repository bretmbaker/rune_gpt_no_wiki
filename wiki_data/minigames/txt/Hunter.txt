When the hiding creature is found, right-click 'Attack' while wielding anoose wandto receive loot and experience. A noose wand is not needed to catch herbiboar.

Miscellaneous[edit|edit source]

Bait and smoking traps[edit|edit source]

There are three ways for player to increase the catch rate of creatures: a higher skill level, using bait, and smoking the trap. ManyHunter creatureshave a preferred bait that players can use on a trap to increase the catch rate. To find out what the preferred bait of a creature is, visit the creature's page or the in-game Hunter guide. By smoking a trap, the player's scent will vanish, and thus make the creature less suspicious of the trap. A trap can be smoked by using alit torchorbruma torchon the trap.

Adding a creature's corresponding bait to a trap will increase the catch rate by +3%, while smoking a trap with atorchwill increase the catch rate by +2%.[1]Due to the low increase of the catch rate, most players believe that smoking or adding bait to traps doesn't justify the extra actions it takes.

Multiple traps[edit|edit source]

Box trapping, net trapping, bird snaring and rabbit snaring can be done with multiple traps at once, with the maximum amount of traps depending on the player's Hunter level.

An extra trap may be set while huntingblack salamandersorblack chinchompasin theWilderness.

Temporary boosts make it possible to use more traps at lower levels.

Wearing camouflage gear does not improve the chance of successfully capturing creatures[2], although the tops and legs reduce the player's weight when worn by 3kg and 2kg, respectively.

The Larupia, Graahk, and Kyatt Hunter gear sets reduce damage from Hunter creatures by 20%, 40%, and 60%, respectively.

The costume maker can also make a few other items.Spottedandspottier capesreduce the player's weight when worn, and thegloves of silencemade from dark kebbit furs makepickpocketingeasier.
