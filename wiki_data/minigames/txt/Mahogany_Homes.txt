Mahogany Homesis aConstructionminigame in which players complete contracts for various NPCs throughoutFalador,Varrock,East Ardougne, andHosidius. The player is assigned a contract by contractors working for the Mahogany Homes company, with the location of the contract chosen at random. Completing the contract involves travelling to the home of the NPC and repairing/replacing items within the home. This requires the use of a differing number ofplanksper contract, and occasionally onesteel bar. The type of plank required depends on the type of contract taken. Four types of contract are available: Beginner (level 1), Novice (level 20), Adept (level 50) and Expert (level 70). The player may choose any type of contract they have the level requirement for, with the type chosen determining the materials that must be used. Higher tier contracts offer higher experience rates for higher cost.

Once done, the player may speak to the homeowner to complete the contract. They may then return to a contractor to receive another contract.

Completing contracts rewards the player with additional Construction experience andcarpenter pointswhich may be used at theMahogany Homes Reward Shop. The minigame offers modest experience rates at a cheaper cost than traditionalConstruction trainingmethods.

Getting started[edit|edit source]

Speak to the head of the company,Amy, who is located inFaladorjust south of theparkat theminigame icon. She offers to send the player on jobs to complete contracts for the company. Completing a contract requires ahammer, asaw, a fewsteel bars, and someregular,oak,teak, ormahoganyplanks, depending on the contract's tier.Nailsarenotrequired.

Higher tiers contracts are unlocked with higherConstructionlevels. Beginner contracts can be started at level 1, Novice at level 20, Adept at level 50 and Expert at level 70. Amy will provide the player with a contract for one of several possible houses in one of four locations: south-east Falador, north-east or southernVarrock, southern or centralHosidius, or throughoutEast Ardougne. At the contract location, the client will list what items needs to be repaired or fixed, which is randomised between the furniture they have. Talking to the client is not required before starting the contract, however, they must be spoken to in order to complete the contract once all items in the house have been completed. The reward is additional Constructionexperience,carpenter points, and the client will offer a cup of tea, which when accepted, restores runenergyto 100%.

Amymust be spoken to foronlythefirstcontract, afterwards, other contractors will also give out contracts:Marloin Varrock,Elliein East Ardougne, andAngeloin Hosidius. New contracts can be in any of the cities a contractor is in, including Falador. Each Mahogany Homes office is located in or near anestate agentoffice in each city. Any tier of contract can be selected as long as the Construction level requirement is met. For example, many players do Adept level contracts past level 70 due to the high cost ofmahogany planks.

While contract level requirements areboostable, invisible boosts such as thecrystal sawwill not work. Building new furniture level requirements are also boostable, including the boost from the crystal saw. Repairing items, such as broken mirrors, has no level requirement. Contractscannotbe cancelled, so boosts should be used with caution.

TeleportstoVarrock,East ArdougneandFalador, and a chargedXeric's talismanorPOHset inHosidiusare strongly recommended, along with thegraceful outfit. Using theLunar spellbook'sNPC Contactspell is the preferred way to contactAmyfor quicker contracts instead of running to one of the contractors.

An example inventory for contract runs is shown to the right:teleport tabletsfor Varrock, Ardougne, and Falador, aplank sack, arune pouchcontainingair,astral, andcosmic runesforNPC Contact, ahammer, asaw,steel bars, andplanksrelative to the player's current contract andConstructionlevel. WearingAmy's sawor theImcando hammerin the off-hand is recommended to allow the player to carry an additional plank. Players without the requisite Magic level to cast NPC Contact or players without the ability to obtain and usetabletsmay instead sacrifice inventory space for teleportation runes, but banking will need to be done more often to restock on steel bars and planks.

Moving a player-owned house to Hosidius may be helpful to easily reachBarbara's house in southern Hosidius, but the teleport to Xeric's Glade from a Xeric's talisman is still closer toLeela's andMariah's houses.

A chargedring of wealthcan replaceFalador teleport tabletsto serve as a teleport toFalador Park, directly north of Amy. The ring of wealth teleport is about 6 seconds closer to contracts and the east bank compared to theFalador teleport spellor tablet. Askills necklaceis another alternative, as the teleport to theMining Guildis just as close as Falador Park, albeit with a staircase and a closed door along the route to the contract locations.

It is recommended to use astaff of airor equivalent to save onair runes, though this may be substituted forAmy's sawor theImcando hammerif additional inventory space is preferred. With a high enough Magic level and teleports in theplayer-owned house,Spellbook Swapalong with an air staff andlaw runesinside the rune pouch provide an additional 4 inventory spaces.

Players who have upgraded their pouch to adivine rune pouchcan bringdust runesand Law runes (in addition to astral and cosmic runes) to cast Spellbook Swap as well as Home Teleport. Additionally, using asteam battlestaffwill enable the player to teleport to Varrock, Ardougne, Falador and POH without the need for teleport tablets - given they're on theStandard spellbook, or can swap to it with Spellbook Swap. This can open up more room for additional planks and more houses without restocking, as well as being slightly cheaper.

Players who have completed the Dream Mentor Quest and have level 86 Magic, who wish to gain Magic experience while walking between contracts, may wield adust battlestaffand theImcando hammer (off-hand), thelog basket, and bringastral,cosmic, andnature runesin theirrune pouch(those with a divine rune pouch can bringdust runesalong with the aforementioned catalytic runes, and wieldAmy's sawto save an inventory space). This setup allows players with the ability to castPlank Makewhile walking between contracts. Bringing a few extra steel bars, and the ability to hold up to 28 logs, reduces banking frequency at the cost of higher click intensity for Plank Make. BringingSawmill vouchersallows a single cast of Plank Make to produce two planks instead of one. This effectively doubles the effectiveness of the log basket, reducing the need to bank further, while also reducing the costs associated with converting planks if using teak or mahogany.

Note:All of the locations for each homeowner are in relative distance to the Contractors except for Barbara,Sarah, and to a lesser extent,Tau. This means that, because they allow you to refill your run energy after every repair session, you don't necessarily need to use runes to communicate with Amy in particular.
As analternativesetup, the rune pouch and spare item slots in place of the tablets can be replaced by teleport runes for Falador and Varrock, and more planks. Abook of the deadand any of theArdougne cloaks(rewarded from theArdougne Diary) allow you to get to the Hosidius andArdougnehomeowner locations respectively.

Note:For players with anachievement diary cape, three of the locations (Varrock, Ardougne and Falador) are easily accessible using the cape's teleports (teleport options D, 1, and 3, respectively), with the teleports in some cases being closer and in some cases further than the default normal teleport. The remaining locations in Hosidius can be accessed by a worn, charged Xeric's talisman; as these items can be worn, this completely eliminates the need to carry teleport tabs or perform spellbook swap, and thereby saving 3-4 inventory slots for construction materials. Additionally, theJarrteleport (teleport option 2) is one of the closest to a bank, allowing quick resupply as needed, and if the player's house is located inRellekka, teleport option 4 will take them just outside thePOH Portalthere.

Contract locations[edit|edit source]

Each homeowner has a set of fixed furniture layouts that you may be assigned when receiving a contract for them. Higher difficulty contracts will generally require you to repair more furniture at each location. TheÂ %-chance next tosteel barsindicates the chance that you will need a steel bar to complete the contract.

Experience costs[edit|edit source]

Each plank gives a specific amount of experience depending on whether it is used to build or repair something. They give less than if used in aplayer-owned house, however the player is awarded a substantial amount of construction experience once they complete the contract. Pieces needing repairs typically include a hat stand, mirror, or range. These pieces only require one plank or bar per repair. Pieces that need to be built typically include tables, beds, dressers, cupboards, etc. Higher tier contracts will typically require more furniture to be repaired or replaced, resulting in more materials being used per contract on average.

The average XP/plank values below were calculated based on crowdsourced data, which details all of the possible hotspot layouts in each difficulty tier. For more information, seeMahogany Homes/Mechanics.

Item | XP/Material (Build) | XP/Material (Repair) | Completion XP | Average XP/Plank | Average XP/Plank(withOutfit)

 | Plank | 22.5 | 127.5 | 500 | 93.7 | 96.0

 | Oak plank | 48 | 160 | 1,250 | 200.0 | 205.0

 | Teak plank | 72 | 190 | 2,250 | 287.9 | 295.1

 | Mahogany plank | 112 | 240 | 2,750 | 346.1 | 354.8

 | Steel bar | - | 120 | - | - | -

Based on the total average experience per plank, these level milestones will take the following amount of plankson average. Expect your results to vary by Â±10%. These estimates do not include theConstruction outfitbonus.

Experience rates[edit|edit source]

The below only accounts for the cost of materials and does not include the cost of runes or teleports.

Tier | Estimated XP/hr | Estimated XP/hr(plank sack) | Planks/hr | Planks/hr(plank sack) | Bars/hr | Estimated GP/hr | Estimated GP/hr(plank sack)

Beginner | 30,000â35,000 | 35,000â40,000 | 350â400 | 375â425 | ~18 | â127,710 | â135,360

With high focus and efficient use ofteleports, as well as theNPC Contactspell from theLunar spellbook, one can expect up to 20-30% greater experience rates than mentioned above. Experience rates per hour can increase when using aplank sackdue to less time spent banking. Its use in conjunction with NPC Contact can also increase the chance of being able to do two consecutive contracts located very close to each other, thus significantly decreasing downtime between contracts. When using theCarpenter's outfit, players may be able to achieve up to 280,000Constructionexperience per hour depending on their efficiency.

With sufficient funds, starting at as low as level 67 Construction (with a +5spicy stewboost to build aPortal Nexusroom) players have access to one of the most effective strategies for teleporting to each location for Mahogany Homes contracts. A Portal Nexus with amounted Xeric's talismanand amarble portal nexus(configured with teleports toVarrock,FaladorandArdougne) allows players to effectively teleport to the vicinity of eachMahogany Homes locationwith just ahouse teleport tablet. Combining this with NPC Contact and the Carpenter's outfit should result in close to maximum efficiency. Pieces of the outfit may be substituted with those of theGraceful outfit, although run energy will not be an issue if taking the tea after each contract.

A similar alternative at lower Construction andMagiclevels (minimum 51 Magic forArdougne Teleport, no NPC Contact or Lunar spellbook access), and/or without a mounted Xeric's talisman, one could consider moving their Player-owned house toHosidiusand using arune pouchfilled withlaw,dustandsteam runes(or, alternatively, using elemental runes and/or a relevantcombination battlestaff). This effectively allows teleporting to each contract location, as the Hosidius house portal is located south of the contract locations in the Hosidius area.Amyis close to the Falador teleport, and is close to a bank herself, which can be useful for obtaining new contracts and resupplying using this method.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Once a contract is complete, players will receivecarpenter pointsdependent on their job tier andConstructionexperience. When using aplank sackalongside efficient teleports and theNPC Contactspell, players can expect to complete around 50-60 contracts per hour. The cost-per-point can be identified by averaging the cost per contract mentioned above. For instance, using mahogany planks would cost an estimated11,466,068 coinsin materials to obtain the full Carpenter's outfit. For the complete log you need to complete 975 Expert contracts.
