Treasure Trailsis aDistraction and Diversionwhich involves solvingclue scrolls, rarely dropped items dropped by the majority of monsters inRuneScape. Clue scrolls contain clues and riddles for the player to solve to eventually find areward casket, which could contain unique rewards. A clue scroll can be obtained randomly from killing monsters, playing minigames, lootingimplings,fishing,woodcutting, ormining.

There are six different levels of clue scrolls, with the higher level ones being more difficult to complete. Players can own up to one clue scroll of each level at a time. If a player receives a clue scroll drop while already possessing a clue scroll of that tier, the messageYou have a sneaking suspicion that you would have received a[tier]clue scroll.appears in their chat box. If a player receives two clue scrolls of the same tier as a drop while killing multiple monsters, they can only pick up one; attempting to pick up the second one results in the messageYou already have a clue scroll of this tier.

While treasure trails as an activity is available tofree-to-playplayers, only the lowest level of clues (beginner) can be found and completed in free-to-play worlds. The other five levels are all exclusive to members' worlds.

It should be noted that if a player dies in theWildernesswith a clue scroll (orreward casket) in level 20 or higher Wilderness and it is not one of the top 3 kept items (or top 4 withProtect Itemprayer) or is not protected by aclue box(in which case the player will lose the box but keep the scroll), the clue scroll will disappear, regardless of whether it's a PvP death or not. In lower Wilderness however (level 20 or lower), in PvP death, an unprotected clue scroll will stay on the ground for up to one hour. Players may find it beneficial to carry aWilderness sword(to cut webs),Royal Seed Pod/Teleport Crystaland/or anExplorer's ring, as clue scrolls are always kept above these items; these however will be lost upon death and duplicates are easily obtainable.

If players die to a monster outside of the Wilderness they will always keep their clue scroll, whether protected or not, as it is an untradeable item.

Treasure Trails will require players to travel all across Gielinor in order to complete them, so meeting the minimum requirements and having plenty of teleportation on hand will help make them easier to clear.

Difficulty levels[edit|edit source]

Clue scrollshave six types of difficulty levels, these are: beginner, easy, medium, hard, elite, and master. More difficult trails provide more valuable rewards.

Only one clue scroll of the same difficulty may be in a player's possession at a time—whether in the player's inventory or in the bank—however it is possible to possess multiple scrolls of different difficulties each. If one of your clue scrolls is still on the ground, it is possible to receive additional scrolls of the same difficulty as drops; if this happens, it is possible to complete both scrolls by leaving one on the ground and switching off between steps. If the player possesses a scroll in the bank or inventory and is rolled as a drop, a message in-game will appear statingYou have a sneaking suspicion that you would have received a/an [difficulty] clue scroll.

Some clues will require access to areas which may require quests, will require items that need a certain skill requirement in order to wear, wield or access, or will give a skill challenge that requires a certain level in that skill. The table below links to pages with all requirements.Temporary skill boostscan be used for most non-combat skill challenges.
