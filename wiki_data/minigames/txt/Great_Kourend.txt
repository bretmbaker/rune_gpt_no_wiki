Great Kourendis akingdomfound in the continent ofZeah, found far west of the mainland across theWestern Sea. It is one of the three regions that make up the continent, the other two being theKebos Lowlandsand the Kingdom ofVarlamore.[1]One of the largest kingdoms inGielinor, it is larger thanMisthalinandAsgarniacombined, and is similar in size toKandarin.

Despite being called a kingdom, Great Kourend is actually a republic, currently ruled by theKourend Council, with the five houses of Great Kourend ruling over the kingdom's five cities:Arceuus,Hosidius,Port Piscarilius,Lovakengj, andShayzien. Although the five Houses can rule over their city as they see fit, they must also enforce and obey the laws set out by the Kourend Council.[2]However, after the events ofA Kingdom Divided, Great Kourend is once again ruled by a monarchy.

Great Kourend can be accessed via ship fromPort Sarim, and the region must have been visited at least once before players may useteleportationmethods to get to it.

History[edit|edit source]

The following section uses date conventions different from conventional formats. The date convention in Great Kourend, according toArceuushorologistImerominia, is to state the number of days and decades since the signing of theRoyal Accord of Twill. For example,3,573 - 73is the 3,573rd day of the 73rd decade. For convenience, dates in this section will be followed by a conversion of the amount of years that has passed since an event. Decades with BA, short for "Before Accord", following them refers to the time before the Accord was signed.

Early history[edit|edit source]

Great Kourend was founded by refugees fleeing from the mainland during theGod Wars;[3]the exact date of this remains unknown. At the time, onlyArceuus,Port Piscarilius, andLovakengjexisted, led by leaders of their respective houses;HosidiusandShayzienwere founded later during theDragonkin Conflictsin theFourth Ageabout 2,000 years ago.[4]Out of the five cities, only the founders of Shayzien and Lovakengj are known:Camorra Shayzien, who fought alongside other heroes during the Conflicts, andYonrith Lovakengj, anImcando dwarfwho fought against theZarosiansatLassarduring theGod Wars.

During this time, theShayzien Cryptswere built, burying Camorra there. In the future, these crypts would host the tombs of the kings and queens of Great Kourend.

It was not until the 10th decade BA (1,510 years ago) that the five cities were united into the Kingdom of Great Kourend byKing Rada I. Most of kingdom's history before the uniting of the five cities remains largely unknown, as they were lost during the Age of Strife in the 38th to 47th decades[5](1,030 years ago).

Sometime during the reign ofKing Rada IIIfrom the 7th to 6th decade BA (1,480 years ago), theTower of Magicwas constructed.[6]The Tower has many powerful enchantments and traps, with many rooms and levels hidden from sight. It is assumed the Tower was used for magical experiments, asLord Trobin Arceuusis currently using it for such a purpose.

The general of Zamorak[edit|edit source]

Sometime during theGod Wars, before the arrival of refugees that would go on to foundArceuus,Lovakengj, andPiscarilius;Skotizo, one ofZamorak's generals, made his way to Zeah after betraying and decimating the expedition team by taking the power of an unknown artefact found within theKaramjan Templefor himself.[7]Here, he used the artefact to summon a large variety of monsters, creating what is known today as theCatacombs of Kourend.[8]Some time after, the Catacombs were enchanted with powerful magic that prevents the monsters within from escaping.[9]

What happened to Skotizo after creating the Catacombs is not known, but he remains deep beneath the Catacombs to this day.

The Council of Elders[edit|edit source]

During the 6th decade BA (1,470 years ago), the families of the five houses rebelled againstKing Rada III, an event known as theRebellion of the Five Houses, and formed theCouncil of Elders. The Council used the chambers in the Tower of Magic as their meeting place, and governed Great Kourend for fifty years from the 5th - 1st decade BA (1,460 years ago).

Sometime during the rule of the Council of Elders, a famine struck the kingdom. Five years after the famine began,Lord Hosidiusmet with the Lords of the other four houses, coming to an agreement that half of each house's lands be granted to Hosidius in order to grow more crops to stop the famine.[10]

The next day, he wrotea letterto the Council of Elders to, once more, grant this request as he had already done so multiple times before.[11]The request was granted, and the famine ends sometime after. Today, Hosidius remains the largest city in Great Kourend.

The Royal Accord of Twill[edit|edit source]

The Council of Elders was disbanded during the 1st decade (1,410 years ago) after the lords of the five houses (Ethrain Hosidius, Seabry Shayzien, Ret Piscarilius, Solange Lovakengj, and Bourath Arceuus) wrote theRoyal Accord of Twill, a document which detailed the transition of authority from the Council of Elders to the Royal Lords of the five houses.

The document detailed the rotation of succession between the Royal Lords of the five houses, with one Royal Lord becoming theGrand Lordof Great Kourend for one decade, and passing the office to the next Royal Lord. Thus, the Lord of Hosidius, henceforth known as Lord Hosidius I, ruled the kingdom for one decade. The next Royal Lord to rule was Lord Lovakengj I, then Lord Shayzien I, Lord Piscarilius I, and Lord Arceuus I. After the rule of Lord Arceuus I, the cycle would repeat and Hosidius would have their Royal Lord rule Great Kourend.

The Long Winter[edit|edit source]

During the 2nd decade (1,400 years ago), the Winter Beast (now known today as theWintertodt), an entity of unknown origin, ravaged the lands north of Great Kourend, causing them to experience perpetual winter, with livestock and crops freezing. The Winter Beast continued to ravage theNorthern Tundrasfor another three decades, with the kingdom's attempts to subdue it unsuccessful.

On 1,778 - 5 (1,360 years ago), fearing the Winter Beast may eventually ravage Great Kourend, Lord Arceuus I ordered the construction of theArceuus Library,[12]filled with texts, documents, and research from all cities, in order to preserve the history of Great Kourend. Meanwhile, the most important texts were stored in theLibrary Historical Archive, a repurposed chamber of theTower of Magic, for further study and additional protection.

On 1,748 - 7 (1,340 years ago), a master Lovakengj smith namedDinhcreates a plan to defeat the Winter Beast. Meeting with theOrder of the Sacred Flame, Dinh believed that the roots of the Bruma tree, a magical tree lying within the heart of theNorthern Tundras, can emit the heat required to subdue the Winter Beast. Dinh proposed to construct a large prison in which to lure the Beast in, and seal it with a large set of doors made from various materials, includinglovakiteand bark from the Bruma tree, with enchantments placed by the Order.[13]

With Lord Lovakengj II approving of the plans, the prison's construction was completed 800 days later, with known casualties of sixteen Order members and two scouts. On 2,548 - 7, after five decades, the Winter Beast was successfully imprisoned and sealed behind theDoors of Dinh,[14]with Lord Lovakengj II declaring the day as Winter's End.

Breaking of the Accord[edit|edit source]

The cycle of succession continued until 1,048 - 13 (1,280 years ago) when Lord Shayzien IIIseized control of Great Kourendusing the military under his command, and crowned himself king.[15]Writing theRoyal Charter, he abolished the Royal Accord and formed the State of Kourend, which would serve the monarchy, govern revenues, and mobilise forces.

On 2,547 - 20 (1,210 years ago), King Shayzien VI married Enia Hosidius, the daughter of Lord Hosidius.[16]Their son was crowned king four decades later (1,170 years ago), and took the name King Hosidius IV in order to distance the family from the breaking of the Royal Accord of Twill.[17]King Hosidius IV ruled for four decades, and his son, King Hosidius V, succeeded the throne and ruled until the early days of the 33rd decade (1,080 years ago).

The Great Expedition[edit|edit source]

In the early days of the 33rd decade (1,080 years ago), King Shayzien VII took control of Great Kourend. During his reign, he was obsessed with theDark Altar, and had spent a large majority of his time in theTower of Magicperforming experiments on citizens he summoned. Here, he oversaw the construction of various new sections, presumably to conduct magical experiments.

Seeking to expand the territory of Great Kourend, on 1,740 - 36 (1,050 years ago), he ordered an expedition to explore theKebos Lowlandswest of the kingdom. A team was assembled and surveyed the immediate area west of the kingdom in order to assess the danger and scope of the king's expedition.[18]

Thirty-three days later, the survey team returns, reporting findings of a mountain beyond the swamps of the region.[19]King Shayzien VII then ordered to have the mountain as their main focus for the expedition, and assigned Magnus Rimor, a Shayzien commander and seasoned explorer, as the party leader.

After a week of interviews, Magnus selected five more members for his expedition: Doctor Bev Crushim, Lieutenant Thomas Berlin, Sergeant Henno Garvie, Corporal Rytin Edshirt, and Corporal Keith Jones. With the party assembled, King Shayzien VII approved of the expedition plans on 1,800 - 36, giving the party 250 days to ascend the mountain and return with details of their findings.[20]

The party never returned. Assuming the party perished in the field, the expedition was declared a failure;[21]the mountain would become known as Mount Quidamortem, meaning "certain death" in Latin. During this time, King Shayzien VII also ordered the construction of a prison in the Tower of Magic.

However, a temple was constructed, presumably under the orders of King Shayzien VII, in acave on the western side of the mountainsometime during the 37th decade (1,040 years ago). Within the temple, an unstable altar was created, giving off a similar power to the Dark Altar, while having the ability to amplify the true Dark Altar's powers, allowing it to reach areas it previously could not.[22]

Here, the natives species oflizardsin theKebos Lowlandswere experimented on, creating creatures such as theCorrupt Lizardman. King Shayzien VII noted in a journal he wrote during this time mentioning compatible creatures in Quidamortem for mass production, suggesting he was creating thelizardmenas an army for Great Kourend.[23]Records of the experiments that remain imply that the process involved a combination of the breeding of humans and lizard creatures using dark magic.

The Age of Strife[edit|edit source]

Sometime during the late 37th decade, theBattle of the Concoursebegan. King Shayzien VII was eventually killed in the battle on 3,316 - 37, ambushed by his own army of Elder Warriors; however, his body was never recovered.

A few days after the battle,Xericappeared and was said to have had a similar appearance to Shayzien VII. It was quickly discovered that he had used the power of theDark Altarand moved his spirit from his mortal body into an incorporeal one. With this newfound power, Xeric proceeded to kill the remaining leaders of the five houses, and claimed Great Kourend as his own, using thelizardmenarmy he had mass produced inMount Quidamortemas his guards and enforcers. The lizardmen would sweep cities and farms, kidnapping people for his experiments.

During Xeric's Age of Strife, many fled from Great Kourend, seeking refuge south-west of the kingdom, beyond theKebos Lowlands. Here, the refugees founded the kingdom ofVarlamore.[24]

At the height of his reign in the 43rd decade (980 years ago), a resistance group called HAX (Humans Against Xeric) attempted to storm theTower of Magicand defeat Xeric, but had failed, resulting in the loss of two hundred members.

Byrne's Revolt[edit|edit source]

During 312 - 47 (940 years ago), Byrne, a farmer, witnessed a lizardman guard murder a child whilst working his farm. Outraged, he slaughtered the lizardman, with the entire town as witnesses. Urging the people to fight back, the people revolted, and within seven days, the lizardmen were outnumbered and drivenbeyond the kingdomin theKebos Lowlands. During the revolt, the temple surrounding the Dark Altar was destroyed as well, weakening Xeric's power and forcing him into exile,[25]travelling west toMount Quidamortem. After the successful revolt against Xeric, Byrne was crowned King of Great Kourend on 339 - 47.

During King Byrne I's rule, he established the KourendRoyal Guard, as he felt that it was dangerous for theShayzien Houseto have control over theShayzien Army,[26]the kingdom's only military, and also allowed people from other cities in Great Kourend to enlist in the Shayzien Army.[27]King Byrne I would rule for three decades, with his son King Byrne II ruling for another three decades after his father.

The Ascent of Arceuus[edit|edit source]

During the reign of King Byrne II (910 years ago),[28]Trobin Arceuusand his brother-in-law, travelled toMount Karuulmto seek theTasakaal, a powerful race of golem-like creatures. Trobin's wife had become very ill, and he pleaded to them to help his dying wife.[29]The Tasakaal then granted them the knowledge of immortality, saving his wife.

However, Trobin used this knowledge and shared the secrets to theCitizens of Arceuus, making them able to become immortal. While not all of them accepted immortality, those that did were granted new bodies to house their souls, which are sustained by the Dark Altar.[30]

Queen Biyrene I[edit|edit source]

Sometime during the reign of King Byrne II, he died of unknown causes, and his wife, Biyrene, was crowned as Queen Biyrene I, as their son, King Byrne III, was too young to rule the kingdom. During her reign in the 53rd decade (880 years ago), she took Lord Piscarilius, who was responsible for Great Kourend's spy network as Lord of Intelligence, as her consort, and birthed a daughter, Queen Biyrene II.

Once her son, King Byrne III, came of age, she unwillingly gave up the throne. Had the law of succession made by her late husband never existed, she would have not given up the throne for her son, wishing to finish the work for this kingdom that she had started.

During King Byrne III's reign in the 54th decade (870 years ago), he was stabbed to death in his chamber by an assassin. As King Byrne III had not achieved anything of note during his reign, it is believed that the assassination was arranged by Lord Piscarilius through the spy network in order to return his wife to the throne.

Queen Biyrene I would rule for another two decades before passing the throne to her daughter, Queen Biyrene II.

War of the Five Houses[edit|edit source]

During the 120th decade,King Agata IVwas overthrown by the leaders of the five houses,[31]presumably due to his mismanagement of the kingdom that left it ravaged by famine.[32]With no one next in line to the throne, an alliance between the Lovakengj and Piscarilius House formed to murder Lord Shayzien,[33]which was short lived as the two houses began to fight one another.[34]Meanwhile, the Hosidius House began to mobilise their forces,[35]andLord Trobin Arceuushas begun to reinforce the defences of Arceuus, not wishing to participate in the civil war.[36]

Though the exact casualties are not known, the Hosidius House suffered massive casualties compared to the other Houses.[37]In addition, structures that were known to have been destroyed includeShayzia, once a castle belonging to the Shayzien House, andForthos, the former seat of the Hosidius House.[38]

While the war was seen by some as a petty squabble[39]and a war of pride between the houses,[40]the war ultimately lasted from the 121st - 123rd decade (200 to 180 years ago), withArceuusnever participating in the war. Despite this, the conflict became known as theWar of the Five Houses.[41]

The Demonic Abductions[edit|edit source]

In the beginning of the 124th decade (170 years ago), after the end of theWar of the Five Houses, the powerful enchantments that prevented the monsters within theCatacombs of Kourendfrom escaping, for reasons unknown, began to waver.[42]As a result, demons began to escape from the Catacombs and abducted citizens of the kingdom;[43]surviving reports of these disappearances indicated that the abductions occured once or twice in the middle of the night.[44]

An unnamed adventurer who returned fromVarlamore, a kingdom south-west of Great Kourend, took it upon himself to investigate the abductions after learning that his father was abducted the night before his return to his family's farm in Hosidius.[45]Though his investigation led him to the acquisition of adark totemfrom the demons within the Catacombs,[46]he was ultimately slain bySkotizoafter using the totem on analtarin the centre of the Catacombs.[47]

According toJonathan, a historian specialising in the history ofHosidius, the abductions continued to occur for nearly a year before ending abruptly,[48]speculating that the demons were subdued by "an even greater power",[49]which most likely restored or strengthened the Catacomb's enchantments.

Relations with Varlamore[edit|edit source]

Varlamore, a kingdom south-west of Great Kourend, maintained a stable relationship with them, managing to avoid any conflict with the kingdom since their founding during the Age of Strife.

As part of a celebration of his 30th birthday some years ago, Emperor Imafore invited the royal family of Great Kourend to Varlamore, and gave them a grand tour of the kingdom. However, during the grand feast at his palace inCivitas illa Fortis, he killed the royal family by poisoning their drinks,[50]prompting Great Kourend to declare war on Varlamore.

The war had ended sometime before or during the reign of King Kharedst III in the 132nd to 135th decade (90 to 60 years ago). In the hope of repairing the relationship between Great Kourend and Varlamore, which had been destroyed after the war, the King ordered an envoy be sent to Varlamore to transport theRoyal Accord of Twillto be displayed in the Grand Museum of Civitas illa Fortis.[51]However, the Accord became lost at sea, and remained so until it was recovered byArtur Hosidiusin the 141st decade.

Today, the betrayal of Emperor Imafore remains fresh in the minds of Great Kourend's people, and the trust has yet to be regained, although it appears thatQueen Zyanyi Arkan, Varlamore's current ruler, is eager to ease tensions between the two kingdoms during her visit to Great Kourend.[52][53]

King Kharedst IV[edit|edit source]

During the 138th decade (30 years ago),King Kharedst IV's wife died giving birth to his only daughter,Rose.[54]The day before Rose's 11th birthday, she and her father made their monthly trip toLovakengj, where he purchased an ornate flask and an old rose-shaped locket from anold dwarftinker.[55]The locket was given to Rose as a present, whilst he purchased the flask for himself.[56]Unbeknownst to the King, the flask he purchased was corrupted with dark magic,[57]and soon his mind became corrupted.[58]

Soon after, anArceuusmage reached out toDavid Andrews, one of the King's advisors. An expert on old curses, the mage claimed that the King's curse had deteriorated his mind beyond saving, and gave a poison for David to kill him.[59]Accepting that the King could not be saved, the King's advisors proceeded to kill him with the poison.[60]AsRosewas too young to take the throne at the time of his death, the King's advisors formed theKourend Councilin order to rule the kingdom until Rose was ready to do so.[61]

The Kourend Council[edit|edit source]

Rose soon discovered what the Council had done to her father. Unable to risk her telling the truth, the Council sought out the mage, who gave them a potion to stop her from revealing the truth.[62]While the potion did work on Rose, it was in actuality a poison made to destroy her mind and induce her into a comatose state.[63]

To cover up Rose's condition, the Council declared that Rose became insane after the death of her father, and considered her unfit for rule.[64]She was then moved away to an unknown location, away from public life.[65]With no suitable heir for Great Kourend, the Council was made permanent,[66]turning the kingdom into a republic. Despite this, its people still refer to it as a kingdom.

The Council proceeded to rule over Great Kourend for twenty years. While crime rates have risen, employment rates fallen, and housing becoming scarcer under the Council's rule,[67]the Council has also achieved notable progress within the kingdom, such as the installation of a sewage system inPort Piscarilius,[68]and establishment of safe trade routes from the mainland,[69]which ended Great Kourend's long period of isolation and allowing relations between the other kingdoms to be established.

Rose's Accord[edit|edit source]

Since the death of King Kharedst IV and Rose, the Council has been accused of corruption, with theRoyal Societyclaiming the convenience of Rose going insane,[70]the same four councillors winning every quadrennial election since their formation,[71]and CouncillorSophia Hughes' recent arrest after the discovery of her ties with theDisciples of Yama,[72]aZamorakiancult who follows the demonYamain theChasm of Fire.

During a protest by the Royal Society inKingstown, the adventurer who had lent their assistance in arresting Sophia Hughes is informed by their leader,Martin Holt, that she escaped,[73]and that an investigation by the Royal Guard, led by CommanderLydia Fullore, is currently underway.[74]Upon an investigation of her home in Kingstown, it is discovered that she intends to escape to the mainland viaVeos' ship, with the adventurer and Lydia managing to intercept her. In a last ditch attempt, Sophia summons theJudge of Yama, who incinerates her for taking advantage of Yama's generosity and his trust,[75]and proceeds to battle the adventurer.

Before her death, Sophia Hughes had mentioned that she and the rest of the Council had done something to a man and his girl,[76]whom is believed to be King Kharedst IV and Rose. Afraid thatCouncillor Andrewswill be keeping a close eye on Lydia, she reluctantly asks the adventurer to seek Martin regarding Rose's fate.[77]The adventurer and him proceed to investigate, with Martin getting arrested byTomas Lawryin the process.

Eventually, the adventurer's investigation leads them to a small shack at the base ofMount Karuulmin theKebos Lowlands. Here, a hidden entrance to the basement results in the discovery of Rose and CouncillorLiam Orson, who had been taking care of her since she entered into a coma. Having been discovered, he confesses to the adventurer and Lydia that the Council conspired to kill King Kharedst IV, but that they did so out of necessity. Liam reveals that they remain in contact with the mage, who helped them kill the King to obtain potions to help treat Rose. The mage was discovered to beXamphur,Xeric's closest comrade. After surviving an encounter with him, the adventurer discovers that Xamphur was the one who gave David the poison to kill the King,[78]and that he was also responsible for redirecting energy from theDark Altar, causing loss in power from the Dark Altar among theCitizens of Arceuusand the death ofThana.[79]

After moving Liam toXeric's Lookout, the adventurer and Lydia decide to end Rose's suffering, and hold a funeral for her outside the shack.[80]With Liam's confession and the knowledge of Xamphur's involvement with the Kourend Council, the leaders of the five houses,Trobin Arceuus,Kandur Hosidius,Vulcana Lovakengj,Shauna Piscarilius, andShiro Shayzienare asked by the adventurer to meet at Xeric's Lookout where they would decide on the next steps. After much deliberation, it is decided a new Accord, named Rose's Accord, will be signed into law upon a vote by the people,[81]where Kandur Hosidius would be crowned as the King of Great Kourend.[82]

After agreeing on the next course of action, the leaders of the five houses proceed toKourend Castleand remove the Kourend Council from power.[83]After disbanding the Council, the vote to sign Rose's Accord passes, and Kandur is crowned King.

However, during the coronation banquet, King Kandur is killed by an assassin, and his son,Artur Hosidius, is crowned King afterwards.Asteros Arceuus, son of Trobin, serves as an advisor to Artur at Kandur's request before his death,[84]as well asMartin Holt, who used to work for the Council.[85]

Culture[edit|edit source]

The inhabitants of Great Kourend experienced a long period of relative isolation for thousands of years, primarily due to its distance from the mainland and the relative lack of awareness of lands beyondKandarin(though few were aware of theTirannwnregion, but was not easily accessed due to theGalarpos Mountainsmaking travel difficult). As a result, the kingdom has had little contact with the mainland, and has gained a cultural identity unique among the other kingdoms.

Date convention[edit|edit source]

Great Kourend has a date convention which is to state the days, then decades, since the signing of theRoyal Accord of Twill.[86]For dates before the Accord was signed, "BA", short for "Before Accord", is added onto the date.[87]However, in recent years since trade routes were established with the mainland, most citizens have quickly adopted the standardcalendarused in the mainland, though Great Kourend's date convention continues to be used in academic environments such as theLibrary Historical Archive.[88]

Religion[edit|edit source]

Despite thousands of years of isolation,Saradoministscontinue to be the primary religion in Great Kourend,[89]thoughZamorakiansappear have a small following as well in the cult ofYama. Even so, different religions began to develop in Great Kourend, such as the religions ofRalosandRanul, whose origins are traced back to the Temple to Ranul and Ralos, known today as theForthos Dungeon. However, they are no longer commonly worshipped in Great Kourend, and instead became the primary religion ofVarlamore, the kingdom to the south.[90]

Citizens of Arceuus, who have achieved immortality during the Ascent of Arceuus, no longer worship the gods,[91]with their church repurposed to be a place of meditation[92]and an ecumenical church where citizens may worship any god.[93]

Traditions[edit|edit source]

Great Kourend is known to celebrate a holiday known as the Decade Dawn Gathering, which takes place on the first day of a new decade.[94]A day known as Winter's End is also commemorated as the day theWintertodtwas imprisoned behind theDoors of Dinh.

Not much else is known about holidays and traditions within the kingdom.

Development history[edit|edit source]

Favour criticism[edit|edit source]

Great Kourend was released7 January2016as the phase 1 update ofZeah. During this time, favour gain within what was referred to as the biggest city in the game was half as fast, as the percentage gained for various activities was half of what it was in its later iterations. In addition, the established lore was that the five Houses of Kourend are endlessly fighting for power after the death of their last king, thus gaining favour in one House while having favour in others would result in the loss of favour for those Houses.

Four days after Great Kourend's release, aDeveloper's Blogwas released in response to player feedback that gaining 100% in some Houses are less rewarding than other Houses. The following additions passed the followingpoll:

Arceuus: Addition of thematic teleport spells to theArceuus spellbookand theResurrect CropsspellHosidius: Access to theVineryas well as thefarmer's outfitandseed boxfromTithe FarmShayzien: Thedragon warhammeras a drop fromlizardman shamansOther:Graceful outfitrecolours for each House of Kourend

Criticism of the restrictive nature of the favour system was still evident after the release of the additional rewards; this was changed with the release of theArchitectural Allianceminiquest on3 March, which allowed players to lock in their favour in a House once they have reached 100%, making it possible to earn 100% favour in all Houses.

Favour gain was further tweaked with the release ofClient of Kourendon 20 April 2017, which rewarded 20% favour in a chosen House, and doubled favour gain in all Houses (the lore being that the word of Xeric's return has spread, and that the houses are now too busy to care about the player's loyalty).

Further balancing changes to favour gain was made with the release ofTale of the Righteouson 19 April 2018, which removed the doubled favour gain reward from completing Client of Kourend, now being the default rate of favour gain. In addition, changes were made to rebalance the average time spent to reach 100% favour.

The final change to favour gain was made with the release ofX Marks the Spoton 7 February 2019, which removed the mechanic of losing favour in one House while performing tasks for another, thus no longer requiring players to lock in their favour. As a result, theArchitectural Allianceminiquest now rewards anantique lamp.

On9 November2023, anewspostwas released announcing the intent to remove the favour system entirely, with details on how content around it will be adjusted to account for its absence. After some feedback, the removal of the favour system waspolledand passed with 76.3% support. The favour system was subsequently removed on10 January2024alongside the release ofChildren of the Sun.

Design criticism[edit|edit source]

Though players criticisms with the design of the city (the unnatural 'square' geographic design of the city was the most common complaint) were prevalent ever since the release of Great Kourend, only minor adjustments were made throughout the months after its release, with the most major changes being done inan updateon 3 March, which involved the addition of more scenery and clearer roads throughout the city and the change from a large clear field with the statue in the centre of the city to a large, tall monument. Despite these changes, the overall shape of the city did not change.

On 26 April, Reddit userGentleTractorcreated a post titledZeah Redesigned, which addressed the design issues that players have had since its release. The post went viral and quickly gained the attention ofJagex Moderators, withMod Mat Kleaving a comment in the post that although GentleTractor's map was "very nicely designed", and that they may well take a few ideas from it, there is difficulty in changing what is already there without impacting the growth ofOld School RuneScapeas a game and as a business investment.

On 4 May, aMonth Ahead newspostwas released, revealing that the Old School Team will be releasing aDeveloper's Blogthe week after, aiming to add small to medium sized updates to fill out unused areas of the city:

The team then stated that later in the year, they will be making major design changes to Great Kourend, with a concept image showing their design goals, which was made with the help of GentleTractor.

Mod West's Redesign[edit|edit source]

After the release of theWintertodton8 September, work on redesigning Great Kourend began, withMod Westspearheading the project. Seeking feedback from players throughout the entire redesign, he posted his progress on Reddit on a weekly basis:

Image | Description

 | Mod West's Great Kourend redesign concept.

 | Update #2, which fleshes out theNorthern Tundraswith the addition of theSettlement Ruinsand theFishing Hamlet(initially named "Destroyed Village"), and addsLand's Endand theKourend Woodland.

 | Update #3, which replaces the centre of Great Kourend withKourend Castleand adds a river that flows throughHosidius.Xeric's Look outis added as an actual location.

 | Update #4, which shortened the Piscarilius pier, tweaks to the western end of the city (in preparation for the upcoming raid update) and changed the Hosidius coastline to appear more natural.

 | Update #5, which relabeled Great Kourend as a kingdom rather than a city. In addition, the colour scheme of Arceuus was changed and a path was added to Lovakengj via Arceuus. Part of theShayziens' Wallwas added as well. Lastly, the graveyard south of Shayzien had railings added around it, and more graves were added to the western side of the city, with the graveyard being given a name: theGraveyard of Heroes.

 | Update #6, which replaced some paved roads with natural dirt roads in the southern part of Hosidius, and theCrabclaw Isleis added.

Satisfied with the redesign, and needing to move on to mapping what would beMount Quidamortemand theChambers of Xeric, the Great Kourend rework was released on 17 November 2016.

In honour of GentleTractor for pushing the redesign of Great Kourend, anancient machinery(in reality, a tractor) was added by thewindmillin Hosidius. In addition, aknightwas added in theKourend Castle, who says he is fromVarlamore, a kingdom to the south-west that GentleTractor had included in his original post.

City Redesigns[edit|edit source]

Upon release, another common criticism of Zeah was that the area was too large.Mod Mat K, one of the lead developers for Zeah/Great Kourend, later stated that Jagex "got the scale wrong" and made Kourend "far too big".[95]

In response to this criticism, Mod West and the rest of the art team began reworking the cities to improve their overall design. The first of these reworks was released on23 May2019, forHosidius. TheTithe Farmwas shrunken in size substantially and replaced with a new town in the centre of Hosidius.Kingstownand theForthos Ruinwere also added to the game. The rework is commemorated in-game via theHosidius Rework Display.

The second house rework, forShayzien, was released on16 June2021alongsideA Kingdom Divided. This rework created a new town for Shayzien and moved theShayzien Encampmentfurther north.

Quests and lore[edit|edit source]

Upon Zeah's release, there were no quests that took place within the continent. Furthermore, the only lore that was available to players about Great Kourend were found in theArceuus Libraryas well as small snippets about theWintertodtthrough dialogue with NPCs in theWintertodt Camp. Though it named some important events in its history such as the creation of theRoyal Accord of Twilland the death of King Shayzien VII, there was no solid chronological timeline that players could rely upon.

The release of theChambers of Xericon5 January2017saw the addition of theLibrary Historical Archive, developed byMod John C, which added lots of lore about the kingdom's history, the story ofXericand atimelineof ruling powers. Within the archive were historians who when spoken to, would tell players about specific subjects, as well as historical texts preserved that players could read, such as theOfficial Order of ConstructionandThe Great Expedition. In addition, the unique date convention used by the people of Great Kourend was added.

On 4 April, a revision was added to theSlayer & Dungeons Developer's Blogproposing the addition of Great Kourend's first quest, developed by Mod Wolf:Client of Kourend. The quest, released on 20 April, revealed thatXericwas the client, who possessedVeos, a treasure hunter and portmaster, to inform himself about the current state of the kingdom.

Mod Ed, a Junior QA Analyst who had left after the release the Wintertodt due to having completed his summer internship, returned to work atJagexon 20 April 2017 and was promoted to a Junior Content Developer on 31 July 2017. He would soon develop more quests to continue theGreat Kourend quest seriesand set up the quest's storyline through a novice quest for each of the five cities:

The Queen of ThievesandThe Depths of Despair, quests involving the leaders of the Piscarilius and Hosidius Houses, were released together on 9 November 2017 as part of Mod Ed's personal projects. This update also retconned the identity ofVeos' Client, no longer being Xeric.Tale of the Righteous, a Shayzien quest about The Great Expedition was released on 19 April 2018.The Forsaken TowerandThe Ascent of Arceuus, quests involving Lovakengj and Arceuus, were released together alongside theKebos Lowlandson 10 January 2019.

During development of the Kebos Lowlands, Mod Ed went through every possible dialogue and item in order to centralise the lore of Great Kourend and set a consistent timeline of the kingdom's history. The changes he made included the removal of the term "Zeah" from the game and the term "House" from the names of the five cities (now used to refer to the leaders of the cities), as well as changing the texts of many books that still referred to Great Kourend as a city two years after Mod West's rework.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Great Kourend was originally planned to be named "Great Goureng" byMod Reach, who quickly changed the first and last letters after Mods Ash and Mat K pointed out its similarity toHermann Göring(or Goering), a notorious Nazi military leader.[96]The sigil of Great Kourend was designed by a player namedAaron Alluyn, who submitted the winning submission as part of a competition ran byMod Ghost, a senior graphics artist in theOld School RuneScapeteam.[97]
