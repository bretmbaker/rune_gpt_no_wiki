Unlikesupply cratesand someimpling jarswhich cannot be taken toEntrananor opened there for possibly containing dangerous weapons and armour, the spoils of war can be taken to Entrana.

Drop mechanic[edit|edit source]

Spoils of war uses a special mechanic to determine items obtained. When the crate is opened, a drop will be rolled for until the roll results in a success, as described below:

Roll 1/120 for the dragon drop table.If unsuccessful, roll 1/50 for the junk drop table.If unsuccessful, roll 1/10 for the coins drop table.If successful, roll 1/50 for 40,000-60,000 coins.If unsuccessful, there is an equal chance to receive either 2,000-3000 coins or 20,000-30,000 coins.If the roll for the coins drop table was unsuccessful, the standard table is rolled.The aforementioned sequence occurs three times. However, if a player successfully rolled one of the three subtables, they cannot roll for them again. For example, if a player received a dragon scimitar, they cannot roll the dragon drop table for the remaining rolls.Once the player rolls the entire drop table three times, roll 1/400 forLil' Creator.
