Distractions and Diversions, also known asDNDsorD&Ds, are sporadic activities that, as the name suggests, are distractions and diversions from other content players may be engaged with. Unlikeminigames, Distractions and Diversions are typically encountered by chance, and may not always be specifically sought after. For instance, a player may receive aChampion's scrollorClue scrollwhile trainingSlayer, or encounterShooting StarswhileQuesting.
