Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanupis amembersminigamethat takes place around the village ofTai Bwo Wannaion westernKaramja. The game centres around contributing to various tasks around the village to earn the favour of the local villagers and receivetrading sticksas a reward.

Players must have completed theJungle Potionquest before they can take part in the minigame. To begin this minigame, speak toMurcailynorth-east of the minigame icon, right next to the gate to thehardwood groveentrance.

It is popular due to the specialHardwood GroveWoodcuttingarea containingteakandMahoganytrees, which are only accessible by paying 100trading sticks. It is also a good way to obtain thesnake hidesnecessary forSnakeskin armourand is the most reliable way to obtainproboscis.

With proper combat gear, the fastest way to earn favour is by killingjungle spidersto the north of Tai Bwo Wannai Village. This can only be done after obtaining trading sticks for the first time by speaking toMurcailyafter repairing a fence.

Acquiring 100% Tai Bwo Favour rating, cookingspider on stickwiththatch spar, exchanginggout tuber&trading stickswithSafta Docfor gem-bladed machetes and cutting teak & mahogany trees in Karamja are all requirements for themedium Karamja Diary.

Acquiring 60% Tai Bwo Favour rating is also a quest requirement forMy Arm's Big Adventure(will be deducted during quest, therefore recommended to get 100% for diary prior to starting the quest).

Besides the trading sticks, the following items are obtainable while playing this minigame:

Gout tuber(cannot be obtained elsewhere; tradeable and expensive)Uncut gems (opaltodiamond)Proboscis(difficult to obtain elsewhere; tradeable)Tribal masks(cannot be obtained elsewhere; tradeable)Snake hide

Necessary items[edit|edit source]

Many useful supplies are sold atJiminua's Jungle Storeto the north-west. Consider bringing coins and understocking on those items until needed to conserve inventory space.Aislesis also located at the store, and will exchange bank notes for 5 coins per note, so it is advisable to bring stacks of noted supplies (especially useful if fightingbroodoo victims).

Gameplay[edit|edit source]

To start the minigame, players must speak toMurcailyon the east side of the village, near theHardwood Grove. He will tell players about the people who have started to return only to find their village overrun by jungle and other nasty surprises. He will then tell the player that in order to help out, they must help rebuild and reinforce the village fence by cutting the jungle. (Note: you must Repair the fence once and claim trading sticks from Murcaily before being able to claim trading sticks from the rest of the villagers.)

In return, players will gain favour, which can be exchanged with villagers fortrading sticks. Players can get amachetefromJiminua's Jungle Storeto the north-west for about 60coins. Players earn Tai Bwo Favour rating by hacking the various levels of jungle and by killing the monsters that appear. This rating allows players to acquire trading sticks from the locals AFTER they build a fence, which later can be used to purchase various rewards and services.

Cutting jungle[edit|edit source]

There are three types of jungle surrounding the village, withlightbeing the most common anddensethe most rare. Amacheteis required to cut them. Players can also obtainopal,jadeandred topaz machetes, which have a progressively higher speed at chopping down the jungles. Failing to hack any type of jungle yields 1Woodcuttingexperience.

Jungle Type | Favour Gained | WoodcuttingRequirement | WoodcuttingXP Gained | Notes

Light | 0.3% | 10 | 32 | Easy to cut but more spars required for repairing the fence.

Medium | 0.5% | 20 | 55 | Slightly more difficult and slower to cut but fewer thatching spars required.

Dense | 1% | 35 | 80 | Difficult to cut and relatively slow, but very good for repairing the fence.

Repairing village fence[edit|edit source]

The rotten village fence can be repaired with amacheteandthatching sparsthat players acquire from cutting jungle. The village fence can be repaired with different types of thatch spars. After being repaired, the fence can be reinforced the same way. However, the fence will eventually decay back to a rotten village fence.

Thatch Type | Favour Gained | WoodcuttingXP Gained

Light | 0.1% | 28.1

Medium | 0.3% | 42.1

Dense | 0.5% | 65.1

Events[edit|edit source]

Several types of enemies may attack players while they are cutting jungle. They work the same way asrandom events—sometimes one kind will pop up, sometimes another. Allpoisonconditions in this minigame start at 11 damage per hit. The player may also revealgout tubersorgem rockswhile cutting jungle.

For lower levels who want to minimise their need for praying and poison cures, it could be advantageous to let a mosquito or swarm continually attack the player while they continue with the minigame. This will also prevent the player from getting hit by any broodoo victim attacks.

Jungle spider | 22%

Tribesman | 21%

Bush snake | 21%

Large mosquito | 8%

Mosquito swarm(level 17) | 7%

Gem rocks | 5%

Broodoo victim(food) | 4%

Jungle spider | 44 | Spider carcass | Spider carcasscan be attached toSkewer sticksmade by using amachetetothatching sparsto make aSpider on stick. It can be cooked for food. | No | 1-2%

You may also kill wildJungle spiders(such as those wandering north of thecalquat patch) to earn favour. This is a much faster method to earn favour for players with high combat levels. Remember that prayer is essentially free here with the Tribal Statue so close by. (Note:you will have to obtain trading sticks at least once first by repairing one of the rotten fences and speaking to Murcaily before being able to use this method. If this is not done, the jungle spiders will grant no favour). Should you use this method, you will not find anyGout tubers.

Note:Killing other player's enemy spawn awards the killer the favour, not the player who spawned it.

Broodoo victims[edit|edit source]

Broodoo victimsare an enemy category of their own. They arecombat level60 and come in three different colours. IfTai Bwo Wannai Triohas been completed, they will not be a problem to kill withProtect from Magic, as theTribal Statuenearby works as an altar (Note:the statue will only work after you have spoken to Tinsay in the village). Otherwise, their powerful and far-ranging magical attacks are the reasondragonhide armouris strongly advised for the minigame. Though they can be killed by normal means, they take significantly reduced damage from normal attacks thus it is recommended to exploit the specific weakness relating to how they were killed if Tai Bwo Wannai Trio has not been completed.

White -Foodof any kind. You getCookingexperience for giving a food item.Green -Antipoisons(not mix). You getHerbloreexperience for giving a dose.Yellow -Relicym's balm(not mix). You getHerbloreexperience for giving a dose.

To kill them by normal means, it helps to have highcombatstatsand an appropriate weapon of choice at that level.

Note:Each victim is worth ~3% favour, 1% more than ajungle spider. It's not recommended to fight them unless you want their drops. Broodoo victims droptribal masks, which may be combined using a hammer with twosnakeskinsand eightnailsto make abroodoo shield.

Useful events[edit|edit source]

Sometimes instead of a monster spawn, there may be something beneficial to players.

Gout tuber- It can be dug up with aspade(usethe spade on the tuber) and either sold toGabootyor planted and grown with theFarmingskill to trade toSanfewinTaverleyfor otherherbs, neither of which is recommended. Due to its rarity and use in themedium Karamja Diary, it can be sold to other players for535,264. Current estimates place the chance of an event happening while chopping between 10% and 20%, depending on Woodcutting level.Gem rocks- With level 40Mining, it can be mined with apickaxeto obtain three random uncutgems, ranging from opal to diamond.

Collecting trading sticks[edit|edit source]

Almost every villager in theTai Bwo Wannaiwill give playerstrading sticksin return for some of their favour percentage (for example if you are given 100 sticks your favour will be reduced by around 10%). The amount of trading sticks received at any one time depends on the player's favour. The amount is also increased if the player is wearingvillager clothesthat can be bought fromGabooty.

Trading sticksCANNOTbe claimed until after speaking with one of the trading stick suppliers below and having them explain in detail what the cleanup involves. Once players have claimed trading sticks from a villager, they must wait a set period of time before they can ask the same person for trading sticks again. Changing worlds does not work. Once the favour percentage runs out, the villagers will no longer give trading sticks.Trading sticksCANNOTbe claimed until you have also repaired a part of the village's fence.Trading sticksCANNOTbe claimed until you have claimed your first trading sticks fromMurcaily.Trading sticksCANNOTbe claimed if you are in the middle ofMy Arm's Big Adventurewhere you gethardy gout tubersfromMurcaily.

Trading stick suppliers spread around the village—some of them are upstairs, and some are far outside the fences. They also move around, so it may take some effort to find them.

Note:You must receive your first trading sticks from Murcaily before being able to receive them from other villagers.You can tell if a villager has trading sticks for you by looking at their off-hand. This visual indicator does not work for Gabooty, as he is always holding trading sticks.

Note:Tamayu,Tinsay,Tiadeche,Timfraku, andTrufitusdoNOTexchange trading sticks with players for work done in the village.

Suppliers are:

Gabooty- In the middle of the fenced area.Sharimika- Upstairs of the northern building of the fenced area. Accessed using the ladder to the east of the building and walk across the bridge.Layleen- Upstairs of the northern building of the fenced area. Accessed using the ladder to the east of the building and walking across two bridges.Mamma Bufetta- Northern building of the fenced area. Accessed using the ladder to the east of it and then down the next ladder to the west over the bridge.Murcaily- Just outside of theHardwood Groveon the west side.Karaday- Just outside of the eastern quest start point on the map.Rionasta- Near the western quest start point on the map.Safta Doc- Near theanvilin the northern part of the area.Fanellaman- Walks along the western coast, to the west of the anvil.Jagbakoba- Outside the fenced area on the south side, where the fires are (a dark patch on the map).

Rionasta's Parcel Service[edit|edit source]

In addition to supplyingtrading sticks,Rionastahas the added advantage of providing players the means to send items to their bank without a lengthy trip toArdougne,Shilo Village, orMor Ul Rek. Banking any item costs 10 trading sticks, whether it is stackable or not. The service can be accessed by speaking to Rionasta and asking what he does around there.

Note:Rionasta only lets players deposit items, not withdraw them. His service also does not includecurrency, whether it be coins or trading sticks.
