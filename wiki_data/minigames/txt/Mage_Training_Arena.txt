History[edit|edit source]

After the discovery ofrunesby humans, many accidents occurred as inexperienced mages attempted difficult spells. The wizards of the originalWizards' Towercreated the arena and the various guardians so that mages could train with the more mundane spells.[1]Unfortunately, it was destroyed bywarriorsandrangersthat were angered by the new art ofMagicduring theRunecrafting Crusades.[2][3]

Recently, the current denizens of the Wizards' Tower have recreated the Arena and Guardians and have also developed charmed warriors to defend the arena against further attacks.[4]

Requirements[edit|edit source]

Players need a minimum of level 7Magicto participate in a minigame, although that will allow the use of onlya single spell. At level 33 Magic (required for Telekinetic Grab), a player can participate in all 4 activities. Level 93 (Lvl-7 Enchant) will allow players to use all spells in all areas of the minigame, though practically speaking only level 87 Magic (Lvl-6 Enchant) is useful. The higher the level ofMagic, the moreexperiencepoints the player will receive.

The Mage Training Arena offers four rooms for the player to practice castingAlchemy,Enchantment, andTelekineticspells. In addition to pizazz points, players earn coins and runes in the activities. Players must acquire pizazz points in each of the four rooms to buy items from theRewards Guardian.

After solving five mazes in a row, players will receive a bonus of 8 Telekinetic Pizazz points, 10law runesand 1,000 Magicexperience, and have theirrun energyreplenished. Players can complete around 80 mazes per hour with few mistakes, giving around 288 points per hour. Players can expect to earn a casual rate of approximately 60,000 xp/hr in the Telekinetic Theatre.

Creature Graveyard[edit|edit source]

In this room, players must collect bones from the ground, convert into fruit usingBones to BananasorBones to Peaches, and deposit in food chutes. Players can take small amounts of damage from the falling bones in the room.

Players will earn 1 Graveyard Pizazz point and a bonus of one or twowater,earth,nature,death, orbloodrunes for every 16 fruits deposited. Each banana deposited will reward 5 Magic experience, whilst each peach will reward 10 Magic experience. Each peach also counts as 2 fruits deposited into the chute. Players can expect to earn a casual rate of approximately 100,000 xp/hr while using Bones to Peaches in the Creature Graveyard.

Enchanting Chamber[edit|edit source]

In this room, players must useenchanting spellsto enchant various objects in the room which turns them into orbs.Dragonstonesoccasionally spawn and can be enchanted for double points.

Players will receive 1 Enchantment Pizazz point per level of Enchantment spell cast (e.g.Level 6 Enchantgives 6 points), with points doubled if cast on a Dragonstone. Additionally, each orb can be deposited in the chute in the middle of the room to earn extra rewards, with every 20 orbs deposited granting a reward of 3blood,death, orcosmic runes, and some Magic experience. Players can expect to earn a casual rate of approximately 130,000 xp/hr in the Enchanting Chamber.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

A player can buyrunes,infinity robes,wands, themage's book, and theBones to Peachesspell in the shop upstairs with thepizazz pointsthey've earned. If a player is having trouble with the arena, anarena bookmay also be bought for200 coins.

Note that the prices listed for the wands (apprentice wand,teacher wand, andmaster wand) are all upgrades, meaning the player must both spend the points and exchange the wand one tier below it (e.g. to purchase a master wand, the player must turn in a teacher wand in addition to spending the pizazz points). This effectively gives the master wand the price of 480 Telekinetic, 480 Graveyard, 4800 Enchantment, and 530 Alchemist pizazz points.

To obtain enough points to purchase everything in the rewards shop at least once you can expect to burn an estimated 4682 Law runes (including rewarded runes), 13000 Nature runes, and between 2000-6000 Cosmic runes depending on the level of enchantment spell used. These estimates assume the following:

The most efficient methods to gain points are used (most points per cast, not fastest points per hour)Staves are used to cover all elemental rune costsNo free casts are used in Alchemist Playground as these are highly randomYou are earning 1 graveyard point per cast of bones to bananas

This will cost you an estimated2,361,024to2,857,024 coinsin runes. For a full overview, see thePizazz pointspage.

The approximate time for completion of each item is as follows -- Give or take ~1 hour for enchantment room, depending on the spell being used.
