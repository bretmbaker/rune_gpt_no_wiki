Rune arrowsare stronger thanadamant arrows, are stackable, and can be used on anybowofyewor stronger. They can be created through theFletchingskillat level 75 by using 15rune arrowtipson 15headless arrows, granting 187.5 Fletchingexperience. Players may also obtain 50 rune arrows from theRanging Guildin exchange for 2,000archery tickets, or obtain 300 atJustine's stuff for the Last Shopper StandinginFerox Enclavein exchange for 3Last Man Standingpoints. Lastly, they can be bought from theLletya Archery shopandDaryl's Ranging SurplusinShayzien. As with mostarrows, they can bepoisoned.

Rune arrows with aMagic shortbow (i)are a powerful weapon forIronmenbefore obtaining theToxic blowpipe, however they are outclassed byKaril's crossbow.

Despite the presumed expense, as with allranged ammunition, rune arrows only have a 20% chance to break when fired. Assuming the player wears a device such asAva's accumulator, 72% of the arrows are returned and 8% fall to the ground. WithAva's assembler, 80% of the arrows are returned instead, leaving none on the ground.
