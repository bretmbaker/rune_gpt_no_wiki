Aseed packis a reward fromGuildmaster Janefor completing afarming contract, or purchased from theFarmer Gricollerfor 30Tithe Farmpoints. Guildmaster Jane will also exchange aspirit seed,seedling, orsaplingfor 1 tier 5 seed pack.

Eachfarming contracthas a difficulty from Tier 1 to Tier 5. For example, Tier 1 contracts represent short Easy contracts such as growing potatoes, whereas Tier 5 rewards would include long Hard contracts such as growing amagic tree. The tier of each contract is listed onGuildmaster Jane's page.

Seed packs purchased from the Tithe Farm are equivalent to a tier 3 pack, with the addition ofwhite lily seedsto its drop table.

Taking from a seed pack rewards the player with one roll on the reward table. The player may keep taking seeds until all seeds are removed from the seed pack.[1]

Upon death the seed pack will always be destroyed.
