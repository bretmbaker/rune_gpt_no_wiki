Shilo Village

Tai Bwo Wannai Villageis located south ofBrimhaven, deep in the jungle ofKaramja. It is home to a number of villagers. However, it does have a problem with its location, as the surrounding jungle always seems to be trying to grow back over where it once was.

If you do travel to Tai Bwo Wannai, be aware ofbroodoo victims. They're part of theTai Bwo Wannai Cleanupminigame, but most players run from them, due to their high hp, strong damage and low benefits for killing them. They also cast stat-reducingspells.
