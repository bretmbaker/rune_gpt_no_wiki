Captain Khaled and the houses he assigns you to steal from.

Stealing artefactsis aThievingminigame located inPort Piscarilius, requiring level 49Thievingto participate. Players must speak toCaptain Khaled, located in the foodhall on the eastern side of the city, to start stealing artefacts from houses in the residential district. These houses are found in the south-western section of Port Piscarilius, consisting of 6 buildings on 4 docks over the water.

Alockpickorhair clipis required to steal artefacts (stolen pendant,stolen garnet ring,stolen circlet,stolen family heirloom, orstolen jewelry box) fromdrawersinside the assigned house and smuggle them out without attracting the attention of constantly movingpatrolmenandpatrolwomen. Players must travel back to Captain Khaled on foot because any teleportation, including random events or logging out, removes the artefact. If players are caught with a stolen artefact, the artefact will be confiscated and the player will be relocated to near thegeneral storeon the south side of the city and will need to get a new task.

Successfully picking the lock grants 750 Thievingexperience. Delivering the artefact to Captain Khaled yields additional Thieving experience equal to 40 times the current Thieving level and500–1,000coins.

Delivering an artefact to Captain Khaled is a task in theHard Kourend & Kebos Diary.

Experience rates[edit|edit source]

UsingKharedst's memoirsto teleport to the centre of Piscarilius (requiring completion ofThe Queen of Thieves) after handing the artefact in to Captain Khaled increases the maximum number of artefacts stolen per hour from approximately 48 to 55.

Luring guards[edit|edit source]

These routes involve luring the guard on the east bridge (the one east of the northern house) so that they are facingsouth, and optionally also the guard on the south-east bridge (the one east of the south-eastern house) so that they are facingwest. This allows players to safely get across these bridges, saving a considerable amount of time and improving experience rates accordingly for very little effort. Alternatively, players can simply hop worlds until they find one in which the guards have already been lured.

Beforeattempting any of these strategies to lure the guards,ensure you have the stolen Artefact in your inventoryor else the guardswon'ttarget you and the lure will fail.

The three main strategies are as follows:

To lure the east bridge guard, steal an artefact, thenrununder the guard from 2 tiles away, andteleport to a location that issouth of Port Piscarilius(suitable teleports include Kourend Woodland onRada's Blessing, Xeric's Glade onXeric's talisman, and Lunch by the Lancalliums onKharedst's memoirs).To lure the south-east bridge guard, steal an artefact,rununder the guard from the tile on the opposite side of the pillar, then quickly run back into the south-eastern house and climb the ladder.To pass the western bridge, wait until the patrolling guard moves east, then run to the tile just south of where he stops. Wait until he starts moving west again, then continue moving. Warning: do not go if the guard that slowly circles the northern house is approaching, as he will catch you while you are trying to cross the bridge.

When passing the bridges with the lured guards, simply ensure you maintain a gap of at least one tile between yourself and the guard.

Run under the guard to get his attention without being caught, and quickly teleport somewhere to the south.Passing the east bridge is then possible if players keep a 1-tile distance from the guard.

Run under the guard to get his attention, then run back and climb the ladder to lose his attention, causing him to look west.Passing the south-east bridge is then possible when keeping a 1-tile distance.

Passing the western bridge, starting from the safespot behind the pillar.

Tile markers guide•Data

The routes shown to the right are recommended for beginners getting familiar with the guards' patrol patterns, or for those who do not plan on stealing artefacts as a training method (eg. those who only want the hard Kourend & Kebos Diary completed). They involve escaping off the piers to the north, heading east to the bank, then south and east to the Foodhall. The tile markers forRuneLiteon the right name each house and points out several guard safespots, which are helpful when learning the names of each house and the route to take back to Captain Khaled.

North-western, western and south-western houses[edit|edit source]

In each house, the artefact is located in a drawer upstairs. For the south-western house, wait until the patrolwoman is walking away from you, then run to the spot in the first image.

Stand here until both the eastern patrolman and northern patrolman face away from you, then run to the spot in the next image.Once the patrolman is south of you and facing away from you, run away from the residential district.

Northern, southern and south-eastern houses[edit|edit source]

The artefact is located in a drawer on the ground floor in the northern house, and upstairs in the others. If stealing an artefact at the northern house, wait until both the patrolman circling around the houseandthe patrolwoman north of the house are walking away from you before moving to the spot in the second image.

Once the patrolwoman is facing away from you, quickly run to this spot. Then, once the patrolmen are in the position shown in this image, quickly run to the spot in the next image.Once the patrolwoman and the patrolman west of you are facing away from you, quickly run to the spot in the next image. If it appears the patrolman circling around the house will be able to catch you, wait until he won't be able to do so while running to the next spot.Here, the patrolwoman must be walking away south of you, and once the patrolman is walking east, facing away from you, run away from the residential district.

Alternately for the south and south-eastern houses, you can run to one tile west of the east bridge guard, then run straight through him eastwards.
