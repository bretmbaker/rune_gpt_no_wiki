[Minigame: Void_Knight_equipment]

Void Knight equipment, often referred to as thevoid set,void armour, or simply justvoid, is a set of armour which can be purchased from the Void Knights with thecommendation pointsearned fromPest Control. To buy or equip any of the items, a player must have 42Attack,Strength,Defence,Hitpoints,Ranged, andMagic, along with 22Prayer.

Void Knight armour contributes Defence bonuses to all stats equally (including Magic and Ranged) without lowering any attack bonuses. Wearing a complete set offers various combat bonuses which make the armour a popular choice for players using multiple attack styles.

The equipment can be stored in thearmour caseof thecostume roomin aplayer-owned house.

Set effects[edit|edit source]

Obtaining[edit|edit source]

Void Knight equipment requirescommendation points, which must be obtained fromPest Control. Equipment can also be sold to theDodgy Squirefor 80% of the item's original commendation point value; for example, exchanging any of the helmets would return 160 commendation points, compared to the 200 the helmet originally cost.

Cost[edit|edit source]

In total, the minimum amount of points needed to get a set that provides the damage bonus is 850commendation points. This cost includes only one helmet, and excludes themaceandseal. An additional 400 points are needed to upgrade the robe and top toElite Void Knight equipment, for a total of 1250.

Players will need an additional 400 points for the other two helmets; this brings the total points needed for a full set of elite void in every style to 1650.

Uses[edit|edit source]

Compared to otherRanged armour, the Void Knight ranged set generally increases max hit but has less accuracy making it good versus low defence monsters, but worse against high defence monsters. The Void knight melee set, however, typically offers better accuracy at the expense of a lower max hit compared to its competitors. This has the effect that inPvMsituations, the Void Ranged set is best used against monsters with low Defence, while the melee set better competes with other melee gear on monsters with higher Defence.

A notable use for Void armour is when killingVorkath, especially when paired with adragon hunter crossbow, which has a 30% bonus in  accuracy and a 25% bonus in damage. ForBarrows, Void armour aids switching betweencombat stylesto adapt to eachBarrows brother'sattack style and weakness. Void can also be used as a low-cost, inventory space-saving, reasonably effectiveRaidsset-up by those who cannot afford more expensive gear.

The set can be used to speed upSlayer taskswhen aSlayer helmetisn't a priority. For example, when fightingundead, aSalve amulet(e/ei) can be used instead of a Slayer helmet. Conversely, when a Salve amulet is not useful, it should be noted that the boost to Ranged accuracy and damage is 10% withVoid Ranged. However, on Slayer tasks, theSlayer helmet (i)andblack mask (i)provides a bonus of 15% Ranged accuracy and damage, which coupled with the accuracy ofblack dragonhideorArmadyl armour, results in higher damage per second than the 10% boost from Void.

Combat style | Paired with | Pro/Advantage | Con/Disadvantage

Melee | Godswords,Dragon defenderorDragonfire shield | HighAttack: tremendous accuracy.High magic defence: somewhere between black d'hide and blessed d'hide armour.HighStrength: slightly inferior toBandos armour. | Biggest loss toDefence(exceptMagic), certainly compared to higher levelled armour.

Ranged | Chinchompas (Grey/Red),toxic blowpipefor effective training or other good training weapons, for fewer expenses. | Like in othercombat styles, capable of giving accuracy boost while not onSlayer tasks.Increases max hit for ranged, which is only otherwise possible withMasori armourorcrystal armourwhen using acrystal boworbow of Faerdhinen. | Slight loss ofRangedaccuracy, slightDefenceloss, compared toBlack d'hide armour; considerably less of a problem when fighting things that are weak to Ranged.

Magic | Staff of the dead | In general, an increase in overall Defensive stats, especiallyRangedDefence. | Loss ofMagicaccuracy; considerably less of a problem when fighting things that are weak to Magic.
