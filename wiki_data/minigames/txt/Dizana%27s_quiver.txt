Dizana's quiveris an item that requires level 75Rangedto equip. It provides thebest in slotranged attack bonus for the cape slot, and is awarded for defeatingSol Hereditin theFortis Colosseum.

The quiver is one of many used by fighters in the Fortis Colosseum, made as replicas of the original that was used byDizana, the Heroine of the Hunt; one of these replicas is found asa displayin theGrand Museum. Some believe that the real quiver used by Dizana is mixed in with the replicas used in the Fortis Colosseum, though the true status of her quiver is heavily debated.

Quivers can also be brought toMinimusto be exchanged for either 4,000sunfire splintersor a 1/200 chance at receivingSmol Heredit(if not already in the player's possession), giving the item an indirect value of1,920,000. Players can configure the charges while the quiver is in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials.

Mechanics[edit|edit source]

The quiver provides an additional ammunition slot, which can only be filled witharrowsorbolts. This second ammunition slot allows players to do any of the following:

Equip two different ammunition types (e.g., bolts and arrows), with the applicable type fired depending on the player's currently equipped ranged weapon (javelins are not applicable to be used with the quiver).Equip two of the same ammunition type (e.g., different types of bolts), with the ammo in the actual ammo slot prioritised (similar functionality to thebolt pouch, but without a left click option to swap ammunition from theWorn Equipmenttab).Equip ammunition in the quiver's ammo slot and an item in the original ammo slot, such as agod blessingorGhommal's lucky penny.

Players can move ammo from their ammo slot into Dizana's quiver using theFilloption from the Worn Equipment tab. Attempting to do so with no equipped ammo results in the messageYou have nothing in your worn quiver to fill your Dizana's Quiver with.[sic]

Charging[edit|edit source]

Dizana's quiver outclassesAva's assemblerin ranged offence in its uncharged state. This can be further increased by charging it withsunfire splinters, giving it a passive effect known asDizana's Sunfire; players can add up to 20,000 charges to the quiver.

When charged, arrows and bolts that are fired from eitherammunition slotwill gain an additional +1Ranged Strengthand +10Ranged accuracy. As the ammunition must be storable in the quiver,Dizana's Sunfirewillnotapply to other types of ammunition, such as darts fired from atoxic blowpipeorchinchompas.

Whether or not the quiver consumes a charge is determined by a random 1/3 roll.[1]Ranged weapons with a charge system of their own, most notably thevenator bow,will notuse the quiver's charges.

Exchanging[edit|edit source]

Players may exchange the uncharged quiver atMinimusfor 4000 Sunfire Splinters or a 1/200 chance for the Sol Heredit pet.

Upgrading[edit|edit source]

Players can bring the quiver toAva, along withAva's assembler,Ava's accumulator, or theirmax capeequivalents, to apply the same ammunition-saving effect of her devices to the quiver. Upgrading the quiver with theranging capewill only provide the effect of Ava's accumulator; the quiver must be combined with Ava's assembler to receive its effect. This upgrade applies toallquivers the player owns, now and in the future - if a player loses all of their quivers and obtains a new one, they willnotneed to go back to Ava to reobtain the ammo-saving effect. The interaction between Ava devices and metal torsosdoes notcarry over when adding the Ava effects to the Dizana's quiver.

Players can also bring it to theShrine of Ralosalongside 150,000sunfire splinters(−72,000,000) to upgrade it to ablessed Dizana's quiver. This makes it so thatDizana's Sunfireis a permanent effect, and allows it to be combined with themax capeto createDizana's max cape. Charging the quiver with sunfire splinters contributes to the required amount of splinters to upgrade. Due to rounding, the progress towards corruption percentage will only visually increment up every 1,500 splinters used, meaning using less than 1,500 splinters will result in the quiver inaccurately stating its progression is 0%.

Wilderness[edit|edit source]

If the player dies below level 20Wilderness, it will remain in the player's inventory but will be unusable and require270,000 coinsto repair. If the player is killed by another player, below level 20 Wilderness,270,000 coinswill be dropped along with any ammo that the quiver was holding, as well as all the charges.

Above level 20 Wilderness,9,600 coinswill be dropped, along with any ammo in the quiver; the quiver itself and its charges will be destroyed in the process. The quiver - along with itsmax cape variant- can be locked by bringing it, along with aTrouver parchmentand500,000, toPerdu. This will allow the quiver to be kept upon death to another player above 20 wilderness but any ammo that the quiver was holding, as well as all the charge will be lost.
