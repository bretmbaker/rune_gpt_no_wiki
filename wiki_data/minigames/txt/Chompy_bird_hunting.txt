Chompy bird huntingis an unmarkedRangedactivitythat involves killingchompyandjubbly birds. It becomes available after completion of theBig Chompy Bird Huntingquest.

Players with enough kills may claim decorativechompy bird hatsfromRantzin the east ofFeldip Hills,as long asthey have anogre boworcomp ogre bowin the inventory. Players may see hats they can unlock by asking him for his "hatsies". These hats provide no bonuses and are purely cosmetic.

To see their kill count, players may right-clickcheck killson an ogre bow or comp ogre bow. This counts all kills made by the player, not just the bow currently checked.

This activity is a requirement for each tier of theWestern Provinces Diary. Players will need 30, 125, 300 and 1000 kills respectively for theeasy,medium,hardandelitedifficulties of the diary. After full completion of the elite diary, each chompy bird (notjubbly) will have a 1/500 chance of yielding theChompy chickpet when killed or plucked.

After the player kills their 4,000th chompy bird, they will gain an additional one-time 30,000 Rangedexperience. When this occurs, a message in the chatbox will stateYou've been awarded ranged experience for your relentless pursuit of chompies!

Equipment[edit|edit source]

In order to hunt chompy birds, players need the following:

Ogre boworcomp ogre bowOgre arrowsorbrutal arrowsOgre bellows

An ogre bow can be obtained from Rantz, while a comp ogre bow can be fletched at level 30 after completion ofZogre Flesh Eatersor obtained from theGrand Exchange. Arrows can either be purchased from the Grand Exchange (recommended) or fletched. Ogre bellows are obtained by "unlocking" a chest (a key is not required) in the cave just north of Rantz and the Big Chompy Bird Hunting quest start icon on the map.

Only one ogre bellows is needed to hunt chompy birds, but using at least 2 or up to 24 is recommended as this will increase the rate at which you catch chompies. The remaining inventory space can be used for 3 toads, which is the maximum amount of toads you can carry. Bring less than 24 bellows if planning to bank theraw chompies, worth2,320coins each, or to makewild pies, worth619coins each.

Gear[edit|edit source]

The highest leveld'hide armour(or better) that you can wear; chompy birds have low Ranged defence, so high-level players won't need more than one piece of armour to save on weightComp ogre bow (highly recommended due to higher attack speed than ogre bow)Best brutal arrows you can afford (if unable to afford mithril, use standardogre arrows)One ofAva's devicesWeight-reducing items such as thegraceful outfitif not wearing full d'hide

Stamina potionsare optional if players struggle with run energy.Ranging potionsare also recommended for faster kills. Carrying abonecrusherorbonecrusher necklacewill grant Prayer XP when plucking a chompy. TheVoid Knight equipmentdamage bonus has no effect on comp ogre bows, so maximizingRangedaccuracy is preferred.[1]

Locations[edit|edit source]

There are several hunting locations to choose from:

2 ponds south-west ofCastle Wars(fairy ringcodeBKP)3 ponds in theFeldip Hillswest of Rantz (fairy ring codeAKS)

The ponds south-west of Castle Wars are ideal because there are no aggressive monsters nearby and there is minimal scenery, allowing for easier movement while hunting.

Strategy[edit|edit source]

It's highly recommended to complete each successive tier of the Western Provinces Diary as you achieve the kill-count for it, as each tier provides a significantly higher rate of chompy spawning. After completing the Western Provinces Diary, and using an optimized setup, you can expect 200-350 kills per hour.

After reaching a hunting area, inflate allbellowsin your inventory.

Then inflate and drop swamp toads. You can hold a maximum of 3 bloated toads, but each dropped toad has a chance to spawn chompies, so inflating and dropping toads one at a time is the optimal method by a slight margin for efficiency, but three toads at a time will require less effort and take less time. After a toad spawns a chompy (or 2 with diary completion), it will not spawn any more. A chompy must be killed within 60 seconds or it will despawn.

You can choose to pluck a chompy's carcass, but this isn't required in order to increase kill-count.Raw chompiesweigh 10 kg each, so they will add considerable weight to the player. Some players (with 85 cooking) choose to bringunfinishedwild piesand add the chompies to them, reducing the chompies' weight to almost nothing.

Chompy hats[edit|edit source]

Though theycannotbe stored in aplayer-owned house, chompy hats can be dropped and re-obtained later from Rantz. Each time you claim hats from him, Rantz will give you every single hat that you've earned, as long as the hat is not in your inventory or bank.
