Charging spells[edit|edit source]

Players who wish to use the threegod spellsoutside of the Mage Arena must charge them first by casting them 100 times on thebattle magesinside the arena's inner ring. The spell does not have to deal damage to count toward the 100 required casts. Once you have charged a spell, you will receive a message saying you are now able to cast the spell outside the arena.

The aggressiveness of the battle mages depends on the god cape worn by the player; mages are not aggressive to players wearing their God's cape.Protect from Magicis recommended for fighting battle mages, as the spells they attack with can hit up to 20.

Player killing[edit|edit source]

The nearbyMage Arena bankis one of only two banks in the entireWilderness(the other being in theFerox Enclave), and one of the few areas in the Wilderness where players cannot attack other players. As such, the entrance to the bank (located right next to the entrance to the arena) is aplayer killinghotspot.

Player killers often use theTele Blockspell here to prevent players from pulling theleverand escaping to the Mage Bank.

Inside the arena, player killers can attack players who are fightingKolodionduring the events ofMage Arena Iminiquest. In addition, some player killers may even dress themselves as theSaradomin battle magein the arena, usually in an attempt to ambush players. Be careful not to attack the disguised player, as you will becomeskulled.

As the inside of the Mage Arena is still considered part of the Wilderness, and located at Level 52 Wilderness, teleports will not work inside the arena.
