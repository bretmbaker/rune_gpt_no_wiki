Levers[edit|edit source]

Teleportation leversinArdougneandEdgevillehave no requirements to use. Teleport to theDeserted Keepin level 53Wilderness. The return lever always send the player to the Ardougne lever unless theEasy Wilderness Diaryis completed.Teleportation lever in the ruins near theMage Arenateleports to an underground area.Teleportation lever at the Mage Arena teleports to inside the arena.

Spirit trees[edit|edit source]

After completion of theTree Gnome Villagequest, you can usespirit treesto teleport. There are seven different spirit tree locations already present throughout the world, some of which may require the completion of additional quests to access, plus six locations at which a player with a sufficientFarminglevel may plant additional spirit trees.

They are:

North-east ofGrand Exchange.Battlefield, north-west of theClock Tower.Centre ofTree Gnome Village.Tree Gnome Stronghold, west of the entrance to theAgility course. RequiresThe Grand Treeto leave from.Prifddinas, in the Meilyr district. RequiresSong of the Elvesto arrive at.East of thePoison Waste. RequiresThe Path of Glouphrieto arrive at.Next to theMyths' Guildin the south-west corner of theFeldip Hills.(Player grown:Etceteria)(Player grown:Brimhaven)(Player grown:Port Sarim)(Player grown:Hosidius)(Player grown: Inside the advanced tier of theFarming Guild.)(Player grown: In theSuperior gardenof aplayer-owned house)

With aFarminglevel of 83 and aspirit sapling, players are able to grow their own spirit tree in any of fivespirit tree patches.  These have the same restrictions as the other normal ones. At level 83, players may only have one player-grown spirit tree; this limit is increased to two spirit trees at level 91 and removed at level 99. This limit does not apply to the player-owned house spirit tree, which has an additional requirement of 75Constructionto create and grows instantly unlike other spirit trees. At 95 Construction, players may also build aspirit tree & fairy ring, which allows access to both transportation networks at once.

Fairy rings[edit|edit source]

After getting permission from theFairy GodfatherduringFairytale II - Cure a Queen, you will find a new network of transportation available to you:fairy rings.

It consists of over 52 fairy rings spread across the land and provides a relatively fast means for accessing often remote sites inRuneScape. Players can enter the fairy ring system from any node while wielding either adramen staffor alunar staff, ending up at the master fairy ring inZanaris. From there, using three letter codes, they can teleport to most rings within the system. Several rings, however, require players to complete quests before they can be accessed. If the selected code has no corresponding fairy ring, players will be teleported a few squares from the main ring.

The main fairy ring is located in Zanaris, just east of the bank. When you click on it to activate it, you will notice the three mushroom controllers pop up. Each controller has four letters assigned to it. Clicking on the right or left side of a mushroom controller will make it turn clockwise or counter-clockwise, respectively. You can make many combinations from these mushrooms, and click the teleport button to go the location.

Players who have completed the EliteLumbridge & Draynor Diarywill no longer need adramenorlunar staff.

Obelisks[edit|edit source]

Wilderness Obelisksare teleportation devices in theWilderness. There are six Wilderness obelisks available, and a player can also set up an obelisk inside their own Player-owned House, however they can not teleport out of the Wilderness to it. Each obelisk, when activated, will teleport anyone standing on the pad after a few seconds to another pad, which is chosen at random unless they have thehard Wilderness Diarycompleted, which allows them to choose their arrival point.

The six destinations are:

West of theChaos TempleEast of theGraveyard of ShadowsSouth of theWilderness God Wars DungeonentranceSouth of theLava MazeWest of theLava MazeNear theRogues' Castleand theChaos Elemental

Other[edit|edit source]

Dying[edit|edit source]

Upon death, the player will respawn at their respawn point. To set a location as a respawn point, the player must talk to a specific NPC and select the spawn point dialogue. Lumbridge is the default spawn point.

If a player wears a Ring of Life, Defence cape, or Max cape and is dealt damage to that takes the player to 10% or less of their hitpoints, they will be teleported to their respawn point. Upon completion of themedium Ardougne diary, the respawn point of this effect can be toggled toArdougne.
