Pest Control Island

Pest Controlis a co-operativemembers-only combat-basedactivity. Players must defend theVoid Knightfrom an onslaught of monsters, while at the same time destroying the portals from which the monsters spawn.

The activity is played in the name ofGuthixto retain balance in the world, which may be disrupted by an influx of monsters invading islands in the south of the world. It is run by an order of Guthix known as theVoid Knights. Players board landers, which transport them to islands under invasion. The activity is divided into three landers; access to each lander is determined by combat level.

This is a 'safe' activity.Players whodiekeep their items, respawn on the lander, and can rejoin combat immediately. In addition,Hitpoints,Prayerpoints,special attack, and runenergyare fully restored at the end of each game. All stats are restored to their normal levels at the end of each game, meaning stat boosts of various potions likeSuper setsdo not carry over from game to game. This makes using these potions for Pest Control somewhat expensive, as each game will require a new dose from each potion.

Requirements[edit|edit source]

Skills[edit|edit source]

The only requirement to participate in a game of Pest Control is to have a combat level of 40 or above.

A minimum combat level of 40 is required to use thenovicelander.To use theintermediatelander, a player must have a combat level of 70 or higherTo use theveteranlander, a player must have a combat level of 100 or higher.

Players[edit|edit source]

A game of Pest Control can be played by 5 to 25 players. Anyone who wishes to play must board a lander. If the lander fills with 25 players, the game will begin automatically. Otherwise, players must wait 2 minutes after at least 5 players have boarded the lander for the game to begin, and can start earlier if there are 5 players and no one else appears to be embarking the lander.

In busy Pest Control worlds, the landers, particularly the level 40 novice one, can fill up quickly. Sometimes, far more than 25 players may attempt to get on a lander. A player not taken in the first load of 25 players is assigned a priority number for the lander, starting at 1 and rising by 1 with each load that leaves without the player. The higher the priority number, the more likely the player will be taken in the next load. With large amounts of players all attempting to join a game at once, priority levels can exceed 5+. However, with that many players attempting to join a game at once, there is minimal wait time between games.

Some players bring items to castHigh Level AlchemyorHumidifywhile they wait for the landers to fill up.

Restrictions[edit|edit source]

Pets are allowed on the island, but not on the landers or in the minigame itself. In addition,Dwarf multicannonsandAlchemy spellsmay not be used during the activity.

Location[edit|edit source]

Pest Control is located on theVoid Knights' Outpost, which is on one of the southernmost islands in the game. It can be accessed from the docks ofPort Sarimsouth of theLady Lumbridge(ship). Speak with theSquireand she will ask if you want to go to the Void Knights' Outpost. Alternatively, you can right-click the squire and select "Travel".

The fastest way to get to the outpost is through the use of theGrouping teleport, by selecting Pest Control and teleporting directly there (this has a 20 minute cooldown andcannotbe cast in aplayer-owned houseor from a PvP area such as theWildernessor theEmir's Arena).

Players can also usePest control teleportsto teleport directly to the outpost. These can be found as rewards fromTreasure Trailsor bought from other players.

To get to Port Sarim, players can usefairy ringcodeAIQtoMudskipper Point, use theAmulet of glory's teleport toDraynor Village, or walk fromFaladororLumbridge. Another quick way to get to Port Sarim is to teleport toArdougne, take the boat toBrimhavenand then take thecharter shipto Port Sarim. The Squire's ship is located right next to the charter ship.

As with most minigames, it is not required to use the official world, though landers in most other worlds are usually empty if a dedicated group is not present.

Gameplay[edit|edit source]

In Pest Control, the main objective is to protect theVoid Knightfrom damage that is inflicted by pests that are spawned by four different portals. The players will succeed as long as the Void Knight stays alive. There are two ways to win:

Defend theVoid Knightfor 20 minutes until time runs out.Destroy all four portals before the Void Knight is killed (the most common strategy, often completed in under two minutes).

At the start of the game, portals areshieldedand become vulnerable over time. Players should move quickly to attack portals as their shields drop while ensuring the Void Knight remains safe. Closing gates as players pass through them helps keep pests away from the Void Knight.

Most players should focus ondestroying portals, while a small group (2–3 players)defends the Void Knightfrom attacking pests. Specificsniper-like players can double as both defenders and attackers by standing on the ranged platforms.Spinners, which heal portals, should be either eliminated or lured away by rangers, mages, and halberdiers to prevent them from undoing progress. Standing directly in front of a portal should beavoided, as this can block Spinners from being lured and may trap players.

Each portal starts with200–250 Hitpointsand has high defensive bonuses against every stat, except for its weakness. When a portal is destroyed, it stops spawning pests andrestores 50 healthto the Void Knight. Players should check the Void Knight's health after each portal kill—if it's being overwhelmed, switching to defence may be necessary.

For a detailed breakdown of advanced tactics and optimal portal-clearing strategies, seePest Control/Strategies.

Pests[edit|edit source]

Pests are the monsters that spawn out of portals to kill players and theVoid Knight. During the game, players must defend the Void Knight from various enemy creatures that spawn from the enemy portals. These pests have different abilities, such as dealing high damage, healing portals, or attacking the Void Knight directly. Some require specific strategies to counter effectively. For a detailed breakdown of each pest and how to handle them, seePest Control/Strategies.

Name | Attack style | Combat levels

Brawler | Brawler | Melee | 51, 76, 101, 111 or 129

Defiler | Defiler | Ranged | 33, 50, 66, 80, or 97

Ravager | Ravager | Melee | 36, 53, 71, 89, or 106

Shifter | Shifter | Melee | 36, 57, 76, 90, or 104

Spinner | Spinner | Melee | 37, 55, 74, 88, or 92

Splatter | Splatter | Melee | 22, 33, 44, 54, or 65

Torcher | Torcher | Magic | 33, 49, 67, 79, 91 or 92

Portals[edit|edit source]

Portalsare the key mechanic in Pest Control. A portal will continually spawn pests until it is destroyed.

At the start of any game, all four portals are protected by shields, which renders them immune to damage. These shields are visually indicated by faint, white lines which surround the protals. Players must wait for the Void Knight todisableeach shield before they are able to attack the shield. While waiting, they must protect the Void Knight from any damage by the pests that are spawned from the portals.

The Void Knight, as well as the chatbox, will announce that a shield has dropped. The shields always drop in a setpattern, which goes on a specific rotation. For a detailed breakdown on the shield rotations, please seePest Control/Strategies.

As a rule of thumb; the first shield will always drop15 secondsinto the game, and the remaining shields deactivate every30 secondsthereafter. All shields will be down by1 minute and 45 secondsinto the game.

Once a portal’s shield is down, players can attack and destroy it. Each portal starts with 200 Hitpoints in the novice lander and 250 Hitpoints in the intermediate and veteran landers. Portals have a Defence level of 120 and a +100 defensive bonus against all attack styles, except for their specific weakness. Players should target the portal’s weakness or use weapons with high accuracy for effective damage.

Destroying a portal stops it from spawning pests and restores 50 health to the Void Knight. The game is won once all four portals are successfully destroyed. Alternatively, the game will end if the Void Knight reaches 0 HP. Any players performing non-combat related activities, such as fletching, will have their actions interrupted when a portal loses its shield.

The specific weakness of each portal is indicated by the following table:

Colour | Location | Attack weakness

 | W | 

 | E | 

 | SE | 

 | SW | 

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Commendation pointsare the main reward for playing Pest Control and can be exchanged for experience, Void Knight equipment, and other rewards. To earn them, players must maintain theiractivity barthroughout the game.

The activity barmust stay above 25%to remain eligible for rewards.If it drops to0%before the game ends, no commendation points will be awarded.The bar will turnredwhen close to depletion as a warning.

Winning players are rewarded with a number ofcommendation pointsdependent on the chosen difficulty level and whether they have completed certain tiers ofCombat Achievements. The most commendation points a player can have at any time is 4,000, as the squire will not let you board a boat while in possession of 4,000 points. Commendation points can be traded in for experience,Void Knight equipment, and various resource packs. You also receive coins for each game of pest control won, equivalent to 10 times your current combat level.

Veteran | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8

Set costs[edit|edit source]

The total cost of obtaining a full set of Void armour. Since the Void Knight mace is not required for any of the full armour sets, its cost should only be considered when calculating for the full collection log.

 | Regular void | Elite void

1 helm | 850 points | 1,250 points

2 helms | 1,050 points | 1,450 points

3 helms | 1,250 points | 1,650 points

Collection log | 1,510 points | 1,910 points

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Originally, players had to deal at least 50 points of damage or repair 10 barricades in the game in order to receive commendations. This is no longer the case as of an update, due to player complaints about participants simply meeting the minimum requirement and not participating afterwards. To counter this, the activity bar was added, requiring players to continually participate or risk not getting commendations. The commendations awarded by each lander were increased by 1 to compensate for this.The boat that drops players off in the minigame is modeled after theAmerican Higgins Landing Boat, designed by Andrew Higgins and used by Allied troops on D-Day in World War II.
