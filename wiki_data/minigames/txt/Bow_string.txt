Abow stringis used in theFletchingskillto createbows. It is created by usingflaxon aspinning wheel.

It takes approximately 50 seconds to spin a fullinventoryof 28flax, requiring 10Craftingand granting a total of 420experience. A conveniently located spinning wheel can be found on the middle floor ofLumbridge Castle. Including travel time, an inventory can be spun in approximately 75 seconds here, which equates to 48 inventories, 1344 bow string and just over 20,000 Crafting experience per hour.

TheMedium Kandarin Diaryallows players to spin flax 33% faster at the spinning wheel inSeers' Village. A full inventory of 28 flax takes 65 seconds after completion of the diary, including bank time.

Historically, the most popular place to spin flax into bowstrings was Seers' Village, as there was aflax fieldnot far from the spinning wheel and bank. However, with the addition of thebankat the top ofLumbridgeCastle, it became on par with, or slightly better than, Seers' Village, if flax was pre-picked. Later on, an even better spinning wheel was added–this time onNeitiznot. While technically further from a bank than Lumbridge, travelling to the bank in Neitiznot does not require passing through a stair, thus making travel easier. In order to use the spinning wheel, players must have startedThe Fremennik Islesquestand have reached the part where they are able to go to Neitiznot.

Another alternative is for those who have completed theBone Voyagequest, and repaired the spinning wheel in theMuseum Camp.At 24 tiles and one click from the bank, this spinning wheel provides an even closer option for those spinning pre-pickedflax.

The best way forIronmento get bow strings is theTemple Trekkingminigame, even with lowcombatstats. Picking the easiest route with the easiest follower allows them to avoid all combat events and can yield about 3,000 bow strings an hour. Using potions to restore run energy and theplank sackto repair the bridges can yield upwards of 5,000 bow strings an hour.

If you decide to pick and spin the flax yourself, having 30Agilityand 0kg as weight, you can average around 840 bowstrings per hour picking flax atLand's Endand spinning it at Lumbridge, 740 bowstrings per hour picking flax atGnome Strongholdand spinning it at Lumbridge, and 650 bowstrings per hour picking and spinning flax at Seers' Village.

It is also an option to pick flax in the south-east corner ofLletya, spin it at the wheel in Lletya, and bank.
