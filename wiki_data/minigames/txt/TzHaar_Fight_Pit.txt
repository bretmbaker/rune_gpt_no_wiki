TheTzHaar Fight Pitis a safe minigame in which players fight against each other in a free-for-all arena. The winner is crowned champion as long as they are both still in the arena and have not been killed yet. Since killing someone ejects them out of the arena and into the waiting area, the first rule is all one needs to remember.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

The Waiting Room[edit|edit source]

The waiting room is little more than a small enclosure. Here, players wait for the next game, converse, watch the current game, or form teams.

Inside the waiting room is a small pillar. By clicking it, players can view various areas of the gameplay area.

Gameplay and General Strategy[edit|edit source]

Basic Gameplay[edit|edit source]

The rules of the Fight Pits are simple: the last man standing, wins. Winners will receive a red skull icon above their head, signifying them as the winner.

The winner can either re-enter the waiting room and collect a reward of Tokkul, or they can wait in the gameplay area for the next game to begin.

Equipment[edit|edit source]

The Fight Pits is an 'anything goes' minigame: any weapon or armour type can be used. This makes the game more advantageous towards high-levelled players wearingBarrowsarmour or usingAncient Magicks.

Basic Strategy[edit|edit source]

Teams:Many players will agree to 'team up' in the waiting room. After all other enemies have been defeated, player of a team either take turns winning or then turn on each other. This is a very popular strategy of clans.

Hiding:Hiding consists of concealing oneself in a remote corner of the gameplay area, waiting for the various players and teams to weaken each other.

Monsters[edit|edit source]

After 5 minutes and 30 seconds, waves of various Tzhaar creatures will appear and attack remaining players.[1]These waves consist ofTz-Kih(level 22),Tz-Kek(level 45), andTok-Xil(level 90), If the fight takes even longer, the player will receive 1 damage for every game tick (600ms).

Reward[edit|edit source]

The last player standing is rewarded withTokkul, the TzHaar currency that can be redeemed at the various shops ofMor Ul Rek, and a red skull () above their head not unlike the PKer'sskull. The amount of Tokkul rewarded is the combined combat levels of players defeated during the game.

The red skull will signify to all others that they are the champion of the Fight Pits. It will remain above the player's head for 1 hour, but the following will cause it to disappear:

The player uses a teleport of any kind.The player changes any of their weapons or armour after leaving the Fight Pits.The player activates any overhead prayer.The player hops worlds or logs out.Taking monster damage.

It is possible for multiple players to have the red skull on a single world, although only the most previous winner will have their name displayed as the champion in the Fight Pits.

Becoming champion is also one of thehard Karamja Diarytasks.
