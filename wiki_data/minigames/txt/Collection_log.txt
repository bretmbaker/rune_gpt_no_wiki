Thecollection logis abookthat players can receive fromThe Collectornear the stairs in theVarrock Museum'sgroundÂ floor[UK]1stfloor[US]. It records nearly every unique drop the player has obtained from various content inOld School RuneScape. The player does not need to have claimed a collection log for it to start tracking drops.

Drops obtained prior to its release are not automatically recorded for any player, excluding untradeable items (such aspets) provided that they can be tracked by the game; for example,long bonesthe player had traded toBarlakor buried before the log's release were not added to it, but any long bones in the player's possession were added.Ironmanplayers are able to add some items collected prior to the release by using the item on the collection log item; this does not apply toGroup Ironmanplayers.

Each entry in the log is tracked by the item itself, not where it was obtained. This means that collection log item slots can be shared across multiple pages. For example, obtaining adragon pickaxefrom theChaos Elementalwill also log it under other bosses that drop it, such asCallistoand theKing Black Dragon.

There is a cap on the amount each item can be tracked, depending on the item in question. For example,Zulrah's scaleswill only be tracked up to 65,535 andbracelets of ethereumup to 250.

It can be stored in abookcasewithin aplayer-owned house, and can also be accessed from the adventurer's log within a player'sAchievement Galleryand theCharacter Summaryinterface.

There are currently a total of 1,766 slots to fill in the collection log, with a total of 1,568 unique entries being tracked. Pets,gilded equipment, and3rd age equipmentaccount for 126 of the 197 slots containing duplicate items.
