TheInfernois a solominigamethat was added toOld School RuneScapeon the1 June2017, along with an update to the city ofMor Ul Rek. The player must survive 69 increasingly challenging waves, ultimately killing the level 1400TzKal-Zuk, to obtain theinfernal cape. If defeated, the player must restart from the first wave. A successor to theTzHaar Fight Caves, the Inferno was dubbed the greatest soloPVMchallenge to date upon release.[1]

In order to access the Inferno, players must giveTzHaar-Ket-Kehafire cape. This is a one-time fee, so after giving a fire cape to him, TzHaar-Ket-Keh will allow players to enter as much as they want. Restocking between waves is not possible and other players cannot enter, although the minigame can be paused by attempting to log out between waves.Purple sweetsalso cannot be used in the Inferno.

ASlayertask ofTzHaardoes not take effect in the Inferno. If the player has previously defeated TzKal-Zuk, it may be chosen as a Slayer task when assigned TzHaar, which will affect all monsters inside the Inferno. The task will also be cancelled in the event the player is defeated, much like theFight Caves.

In 2018, the Inferno was made inaccessible onunrestricted worldsto prevent players from practising an unlimited amount of times without supply costs.[2]However, this decision appears to have been reversed since 2021, with nearly all unrestricted worlds since theEquipment Rebalancing Betaallowing players access to it.

Background[edit|edit source]

According toTzHaar-Ket-Keh, the Inferno was originally a large incubation pool for newly hatchedTzHaarto regain memories of their ancestors. The TzHaar found out that the deeper they placed theeggs, the TzHaar emerging from them would gain more memories and knowledge of their old ancestors. Unfortunately, they went too far and completely drained the lava, finding an ancient incubation chamber. They decided to place eggs of Fight Caves monsters in there, but it completely backfired and caused the creation of new, volatile volcanic creatures that were extremely aggressive and fought for dominance. The TzHaar struggle against these new monsters and are hesitant to allow humans to tackle them. Similarly to humans, these monsters are foreign to TzHaar, as their names are prefixed with Jal, meaning "foreign" in the TzHaar language.

Monsters[edit|edit source]

There are unique monsters encountered within the Inferno. Several of these monsters are similar to theirFight Cavescounterpart, while others are completely new.

Lvl | Image | Name(Colloq.) | HP | Defence | Magic | Attack(s) | Max Hit | Counterpart | Notes

32 |  | Jal-Nib("Nibbler") | 10 | 15 | 15 | Melee (Crush) | 4 |  | They spawn in the middle and randomly pick any remaining pillar to attack. If they manage to destroy one, it cannot be used for safespotting and will damage players and monsters who are standing on adjacent tiles upon collapse. If no pillars remain, they will chase the player instead.

85 |  | Jal-MejRah("Bat") | 25 | 55 | 120 | Ranged | 19 | Tz-Kih | Drains run energy on every hit and when not praying protect from missiles has a chance to drain all combat stats by 1 on every successful hit.

165 |  | Jal-Ak("Blob") | 40 | 95 | 160 | Magic, Ranged, Melee (Crush) | 29 | Tz-Kek | Attacks primarily with magic and ranged. Its attacks are delayed; it detects if the player is protecting against magic or ranged as soon as it is in range or 3 ticks after its last attack, and attacks with the opposite style after another three ticks. Spawns three smaller versions of itself on death using each side of the combat triangle (Jal-AkRek-Xil,Jal-AkRek-Mej,Jal-AkRek-Ket).

240 |  | Jal-ImKot("Meleer") | 75 | 120 | 120 | Melee (Slash) | 49 | Yt-MejKot | It can only attack with melee. If unable to attack the player, it will burrow down and pop up near the player to attack them after 30 seconds. This timer can be reset by letting it attack at least once before seeking cover again.

370 |  | Jal-Xil("Ranger") | 125 | 60 | 90 | Ranged, Melee | 46 | Tok-Xil | It primarily uses ranged attacks but has the ability to melee any adjacent tile, including diagonally if it has line of sight.

490 |  | Jal-Zek("Mager") | 220 | 260 | 300 | Magic, Melee | 70 | Ket-Zek | It primarily uses magical attacks but has the ability to melee any adjacent tile, including diagonally if it has line of sight. It can revive slain monsters in the current round they appear in. The revived monsters have half health and each can only be revived once.

900 |  | JalTok-Jad | 350 | 480 | 510 | Magic, Melee, Ranged | 113 | TzTok-Jad | Uses each combat style with devastating damage, but each hit can be blocked with appropriate prayers. It summons 5 Yt-HurKot healers (3 during Waves 68 and 69) when it reaches half health.

141 |  | Yt-HurKot("Jad Healer") | 90 | 100 | 150 | Melee | 18 |  | They are summoned whenJalTok-Jadis at half health, and heals it until they are attacked. Identical to Yt-HurKot from the Fight Caves, but stronger.

1400 |  | TzKal-Zuk | 1200 | 260 | 150 | Magic, Ranged | 148 |  | The final boss in the Inferno. He attacks using a devastating fireball that can be avoided by seeking cover behind the floating shield.

250 |  | Jal-MejJak("Zuk Healer") | 75 | 100 | 1 | Ground-targeted AoE | 10 |  | Four are summoned whenTzKal-Zukfalls to 240 health, and they will heal it until they are attacked. Upon being attacked, they throw lava into the arena which deals area of effect damage.

Wave breakdown[edit|edit source]

Each wave displays which monster will spawn. There are 69 waves in total. Starting on wave 1, there are threepillarswhich the Jal-Nibs attempt to destroy. Each pillar has 255 hit points. Any remaining pillars by the end of wave 66 are automatically destroyed by the start of wave 67. This can damage the player if they are on an adjacent tile.

Key to shortened names:

Nibbler:Jal-NibBat:Jal-MejRahBlob:Jal-AkMelee:Jal-ImKotRanger:Jal-XilMage:Jal-ZekJad:JalTok-Jad

Final boss[edit|edit source]

On the 69th and final wave,TzKal-Zukwill break free from the northern wall. TzKal-Zuk cannot be reached with melee and has 1200Hitpoints. Floating in the lava and moving back and forth between it and the player is anAncestral Glyph, which protects the player from Zuk's attacks. Standing behind this glyph ismandatory, as Zuk's attacks have a max hit of 148, which has the potential to instantly kill the player even when fully overhealed; likewise, the attack cannot betick eateneither.

Due to two rock outcrops on either side of the boss, there are a total of six (three per side) grouped tiles from which a player has no line of sight to TzKal-Zuk for a ranged or magic attack. Attempting to attack from these tiles will draw the player towards the middle of the room until they have a line of sight which can be extremely dangerous, especially if the shield is moving in the opposite direction. Although the player may not attack from these tiles, they may be hit on them by TzKal-Zuk.

Since TzKal-Zuk's normal attack cycle and the rotational cycle of the shield align, there are four consistent safespots that can be used to simplify the task of seeking cover behind the shield before TzKal-Zuk is putting up his last fight (occurs if Hitpoints are lowered below 240), which is when his attacks speed up considerably.

Throughout this fight, other monsters spawn periodically and on cues. A set of Jal-Xil and Jal-Zek will regularly spawn behind the player on a repeating 3:30 minute timer, attacking the shield until they are attacked, whereupon they retaliate. When TzKal-Zuk is below 480 Hitpoints, a JalTok-Jad will spawn behind the player, similarly attacking the shield, and a one-time addition of 1:45 minutes is made to the set timer (which is paused between 600 and 480 Hitpoints and is resumed as soon as Jad spawns) to allow the player to face Jad without a set of Jal-Xil and Jal-Zek.

If the player neglects the monsters attacking the shield for too long, the shield will be destroyed, exposing the player to the attacks of TzKal-Zuk without any protection.

When TzKal-Zuk is below 240 Hitpoints, fourJal-MejJaksare spawned, rapidly healing it, and TzKal-Zuk's attacks speed up considerably. When they are attacked, they stop healing and attack the player with area-of-effect blasts.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Once players manage to defeat TzKal-Zuk, they will be rewarded with theinfernal cape.

Tokkulis also given, with increasing amounts based on the wave they were defeated on (16,440 maximum; this is doubled if the player has completed the elite tier of theKaramja Diary).

There is also a 1/100 chance of receiving aJal-nib-rekpetupon defeating it. This chance is increased to 1/75 if the player was on aSlayertask to defeat TzKal-Zuk. Outside, players may giveTzHaar-Ket-Kehany unwanted infernal capes for a second chance at a Jal-nib-rek, having also a 1/100 chance.

Competitions[edit|edit source]

Upon release, Jagex started a competition where the first three players to obtain an Infernal cape would be rewarded in real life. The first player to obtain it would get a real-life version of the Infernal cape, a RuneFest 2017 ticket & travel, and lifetime membership. The second player would get a RuneFest 2017 ticket & travel but no real-life Infernal cape. The third player would get a RuneFest 2017 ticket and lifetime membership, but no travel expenses or cape.

Development history[edit|edit source]

Initial pitch[edit|edit source]

The concept of a Fight Cave expansion and "Jad 2" was first teased atRuneFest2015, which was slated for a summer 2016 release. Here, upon defeatingTzTok-Jad, players could choose to claim their fire cape or sacrifice it, the latter in which would cause the floor to collapse and fight subsequent waves of more powerful monsters, all culminating into fighting "Jad 2".

ADeveloper's Blogwas released on11 January2016, where it was revealed that the rewards would be one of three capes, each of them boasting best-in-slot stats for each combat style.

The proposed stats for the capes obtained upon defeating "Jad 2" was as follows:

Item | Attack bonuses | Defence bonuses | Other

 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 

Fire cape | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 4 | 0 | 0% | 2

Jad 2 melee cape | 4 | 4 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 8 | 0 | 0% | 2

The Fight Cave expansion waspolledinOld School Content Poll #38: Jad II, Deadman & Zeah, failing by 2.5%. Shortly after the poll ended, anotherDeveloper's Blogwas released, now referring to the expansion as The Inferno and its boss as TzKal-Zuk.

The blog now revised the design as entirely separate from the Fight Cave, now revealing that the player will face 40+ waves of six new TzHaar creatures leading to the fight against TzKal-Zuk. In addition, the rewards were reduced to only the melee cape from the previous blog.

The blog also stated that the Inferno was planned to be released around mid-February due to a gap in the Old School Team's release schedule, but due to it now being pitched as a separate piece of content, releasing it then would result in the graphics suffering as a result, likely having to re-use a lot of assets from the TzHaar area.

Because of the tight release schedule past February (Monkey Madness II, seasonalDeadman Mode, Zeah batch 2 (the Wintertodt and the Paradigm of Exodus, now known as theChambers of Xeric), the team then gave players the option of delaying the Inferno until Zeah batch 3 next year, the city of Keruulm (which is now in-game asMount Karuulm). Player feedback resulted in Jagex delaying the update until next year.

With February now freed up, anotherDeveloper's Blogwas released, asking for quality-of-life (QoL) suggestions for their next polls. February would then become known as "QoL month" in the years to come, where the team dedicates the month to requested QoL updates.

Brimstone & The Inferno[edit|edit source]

Brimstone & The Inferno would later be revealed at RuneFest 2016:

Over a year later on15 March2017, Jagex released aDeveloper's Blog, where the Kahlith, a race once created from the TzHaar and born from the core of the Inferno, resided in a village west ofLovakengjwithin a dormant volcano.

Besides the Inferno, which rewards the now-named infernal cape, it was proposed that players would be able to pickpocket the Kahlith for gems and Tokkul, fishinginfernal eelsand attackable Kahlith citizens that would drop Kahlith armour.

Mor Ul Rek & The Inferno[edit|edit source]

After a day of feedback, the blog was quickly revised, changing the location from west of Lovakengj to within the inaccessible section of TzHaar City, now namedMor Ul Rek, with all the content within it renamed (such as the Kahlith armour now beingobsidian armour.)

Mor Ul Rek and The Inferno were then polled inMor Ul Rek and The Infernoon 24 March 2017, with all the questions passing.
