Pizazz pointsare points that are awarded from participating in the rooms in theMage Training Arena. They can be exchanged with theRewards Guardianforwands,Infinity robes, theMage's book, andrunes, or to unlock theBones to Peachesspell. They are not a physical item and are thus untradeable between players, but players can see how many they have by talking to theirprogress hatthey get from the Mage Training Arena.

There is amaximumnumber of points a player can have in each activity:

Telekinetic pizazz points - 8,000 pointsGraveyard pizazz points - 8,000 pointsEnchantment pizazz points - 32,000 pointsAlchemist pizazz points - 16,000 points

If the maximum for an activity is reached, playerswillbe allowed to enter that chamber, but will receive a warning before doing so.

Cost per point[edit|edit source]

The different types of Pizazz points have different costs per point associated with them. In the calculation of how much one point costs, it is assumed staves are used to compensate for all elemental runes (e.g. aStaff of firefor theAlchemist's Playground, and aMud battlestafffor theGraveyard room).

Assuming each maze in theTelekinetic Theatrehas the same probability to be assigned, an average of 8.3 spell casts is required for every maze. Factoring in the bonus 10law runesand 8 bonus points received after completing 5 mazes in a row, players will spend 31.5 law runes to gain 18 points. This means the cost per point in this room is231 coins.

In theCreature Graveyard, we can assume an average cast ofBones to Bananasallows for depositing 20 bananas and eating the remaining bananas. This means everynature runeis worth 1.25 points in this room. This makes the cost per point92 coins.

In theEnchanting Chamber, the cost per point strongly depends on the spell used to enchant items. ForLvl-1 Enchant, everycosmic runeresults in 1.1 point on average (due to the bonus every tenth shape. This makes the cost per point112.73 coinsfor this enchantment level. This cost can be divided by the level of enchantment used, up toLvl-6 Enchantcosting18.79 coins(1/6th of the cost). When enchantingdragonstones, the points for each level increases to 2, which means the price for Lvl-1 is62 coins, and for Lvl-6 it is10.33 coins.

Finally, in theAlchemist's Playground, the fastest strategy is to only alchemise items worth 30 coins. A conservative estimate is that roughly 10% of the time, the item worth 30 coins is free. This means that everynature runeis worth 33 coins on average. Since 1 point is awarded for every 100 coins deposited, every 3 nature runes are worth one point. This makes the cost per point345 coins. The cost per point can be further reduced by alchemising cheaper items whenever they are selected to spend no runes on alchemising.

This gives the following table of cost per point:

Category | Runes per point | Cost per point

Telekinetic | 1.75 | 231

Graveyard | 0.8 | 92

Enchantment (shapes) | 0.91 (Lvl-1) – 0.15 (Lvl-6) | 112.73–18.79

Enchantment (dragonstones) | 0.5 (Lvl-1) – 0.08 (Lvl-6) | 62–10.33

Alchemist | 3 | 345
