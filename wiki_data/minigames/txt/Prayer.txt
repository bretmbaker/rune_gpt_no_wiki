Prayer Points[edit|edit source]

Prayer pointsare a measure of the player's ability to useprayersand are shown as whole-point integer, in the background it is represented as a fraction. This fraction can be reset through aRejuvenation poolor dying. Drinking aPrayer potionwillNOTreset it. A player's maximum, unboosted number of prayer points is equal to theirPrayerlevel. Prayer points can be restored a number of ways including praying at analtar, using arejuvenation pool(or better) in aplayer-owned house, or drinking a dose of aprayer potion.

The player's current prayer points are displayed on the game'sskills taband are displayed by theminimapif the Data orb option is toggled on. The number of prayer points the player has remaining is an indication of how long a player can use prayers before having to restore them. The player can left-click on the prayer orb to begin usingquick prayers, or the player can right-click on the prayer orb to set up their desired quick prayers.

The player's maximum prayer points can be raised permanently by levelling up the prayer skill or temporarily withboosts(e.g. by using theancient maceor theEldritch nightmare staff).

Recharging points[edit|edit source]

Players can recharge their prayer points to maximum using analtar, identified by an altariconon theworld mapandminimap.

Praying at the following altars will recharge the player's prayer points above the maximum:

Prayer drain[edit|edit source]

While active, each prayer slowly depletes a player's prayer points. Different prayers drain prayer points at different rates. For example, a low-level prayer such asThick Skindrains prayer significantly slower than its higher level counterpart,Steel Skin.

Prayer bonus, determined by worn equipment allows a player to slow the rate at which prayer points are drained. Players can view their prayer bonus in theEquipment Statswindow. Only certain types of armour, clothing,weapons, andjewellerygrant a prayer bonus.

In practice, each point of prayer bonus effectively increases the duration prayer points will last by 3.33%. For example, if a player uses the "Protect from Melee" prayer with a prayer bonus of 0, their prayer points would drain at a rate of 1 point every 3 seconds. If that player then equipsarmourgiving a prayer bonus of +15, the player can expect this duration to increase by 50%, draining 1 point per 4.5 seconds instead of 1 point every 3 seconds.

Prayer bonus does not help to stave off the side-effects of locations andmonstersthat drain Prayer.

Prayer drain mechanics[edit|edit source]

Each prayer has an associateddrain effect, and the total across all activated prayers is added to an internalprayer drain countereachgame tick. Whenever this counter value exceeds a certain threshold, known as the player'sprayer drain resistance, one prayer point is depleted, and that player's current prayer drain counter value decreases by their prayer drain resistance. As this can occur more than once per game tick, it is possible to lose more than one prayer point within a single game tick.[1]

Players have a baseprayer drain resistanceof 60, increased by 2 for every point of prayer bonus. In the example above, a player with a prayer bonus of +15 would have a prayer drain resistance of 90, instead of 60. This would result in prayer points taking an average of 50% longer to deplete. Prayer drain resistance can be calculated with the following formula:

drainresistance=2×bonus+60

The number of seconds it takes for one Prayer point to drain, requiring the summation of the drain effect of each Prayer as drain effect, is then calculated with the following formula:

seconds=0.6×(drainresistance/draineffect)

Quick prayers[edit|edit source]

On6 February 2014, data orbs were added  with thePrayer iconbeing given the ability to select quick prayers. It can be left-clicked to activate, or deactivate, a group of prayers preselected by the player simultaneously. You can select which prayers are activated by right-clicking the button and choosing the "Setup quick-prayers" option. Before the addition of this function, players had to locate the prayer tab and activate them one by one. This function allows players to place many of the most useful prayers on immediate standby. It is very useful for prayer flicking. Quick prayers can also be used as an easy way to turn off all prayers by double left-clicking it (to turn quick prayers on, then off).

Prayer filtering[edit|edit source]

By enabling the prayers filter via right-clicking the prayer icon, players may alter the contents of their prayers interface based on a number of filters by clicking the "Filters" button on the bottom of the prayer interface:

Lower tiers of tiered prayersTiered prayers even if multi-skill prayers are availableRapid Healing prayersPrayers the player lacks the Prayer level to activatePrayers the player lacks the requirements to activate

Once a player checks or unchecks the desired filter, tapping the "Filters" button again will display the filtered interface. Unlike thespellbookfiltering, prayer icons will not enlarge if enough prayers are filtered out.

Following anupdate,third-party clientdevelopers were allowed to implement control over the visibility and order of individual prayers, though the feature is not present on official clients.

Prayer flicking[edit|edit source]

Flicking lets a player use prayers in combat without having theirprayer pointsdrain continuously. A skilled player will turn prayers on right before their effects are required and turn them off immediately after. This will stop prayer from continuously draining between attacks. For prayer flicking involvingprotection prayers, the player will activate the prayer just before being hit, and turn it off immediately after the hit lands. This uses up very few prayer points, and negates prayer point usage completely if done quickly enough.

Although flicking requires timing and skill, doing it successfully can save prayer points and allow a player to fightmonstersfor much longer, or increase damage rates with offensive prayers. In some cases, flicking can take advantage of mechanics, such as renderingDessousunable to attack the player. If done perfectly, no prayer will be consumed regardless of how long the fight lasts.

Most players will not have totally perfect timing. Wearing gear with a high prayer bonus will help you prayer flick much longer. Flicking is considerably easier when fighting a monster that matches your weapon's speed, and/or when playing with sounds on. A metronome set to 100 beats per minute (or once every 0.6 seconds) can be used for practicing.

Prayer flicking is a powerful technique, but it comes with several drawbacks. It requires high click intensity, as players must constantly toggle prayers on and off with precise timing. Mastering it takes time and practice, and even then, mistakes can be costly. In high-risk situations, a mistimed flick can leave a player vulnerable, resulting in unnecessary damage or even death. Additionally, the constant focus and effort required make it impractical for long fights or extended gameplay sessions.

How to prayer flick[edit|edit source]

To prayer flick, one must activate and deactivate a prayer so it is active on the neededgame tick. If flicking a combat prayer, this is the tick you attack. If flicking a protection prayer, this is the tick your enemy attacks (which is when their attack animation begins, not necessarily the tick in which you take damage). If flicking against monsters, it will help immensely to know the monster'sattack speed.

While it is possible to prayer flick against monsters that use Magic or Ranged attacks, it is best to practice against monsters that use melee at a 2.4 second (4 tick) interval while using a 4-tick weapon if you are learning how to flick for the first time. Practicing duringSlayertasks is a relatively safe and yet rewarding way to learn.Mutated Bloodveldsare an example of a good monster to practice at: they are not aggressive, their hits are accurate (meaning you will see easily when you make a mistake), and they are easy to reach.

In essence, when using protection prayers, activate the prayer just before the opponent's attack animation begins (for example, a ranger raising his bow and shooting the arrow, or a meleer swinging his sword). When using offensive prayers, activate the prayer just before your attack animation begins (and the experience drop shows up, if your hit is successful). To consume no prayer points, turn the prayer off within the next tick. This is often calledlazy flicking.

Note:Latency to the server is unavoidable, usually the ping is 20 to 150 milliseconds to the closest server. Keep this in mind when prayer flicking.

There are some exceptions to the rule of protection prayer having to be active on the first tick of the attack: for example, many ofTzTok-Jad,The NightmareandVerzik Vitur's attacks are calculated shortly after the start of their attack animation to allow the player to react to them switching between their attacks.

1-tick prayer flicking[edit|edit source]

While this method is extremely click-intensive, it is possible to have your quick-prayers active at all times while not draining any prayer points. 1-tick prayer involves activating and deactivating your quick-prayers on every single game tick, and requires precise timing along with strict adherence to the click pattern. Notably, this is the only way to reliably protect yourself in a multi-combat zone filled with aggressive enemies without expending prayer points, and works against enemies that cannot be reliably prayer-flicked against due to varying attack speeds (such ascave horrors). In addition, it can reliably be used for both protection and offensive prayers, to nullify and deal more damage at the same time. When done correctly, your overhead prayer should be visible at all times, but you will not lose any prayer points.

ThePreserveandRapid Healprayers provide no benefit when using this technique.

Ticks | Game Action

1 | Turn prayer on

2+ | Turn prayer off, turn prayer back on before tick is over

Equipment that affects Prayer[edit|edit source]

Some equipment can bypass or disable overhead other players'protection prayers, as well as drain, restore or depend on Prayer.
