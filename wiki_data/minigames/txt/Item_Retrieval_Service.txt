[Minigame: Item_Retrieval_Service]

Item Retrieval Services, commonly known asdeathbanks, are in-game services offered outside of dangerous,instancedbossfights and other challenges. If a playerdiesduring one of these activities, their items will be saved and made available to retrieve at a later time, usually after the player pays a certain fee. This system prevents the player from permanently losing items due to an instanced area ceasing to exist after the player dies. Any items stored at an Item Retrieval Service will bepermanently lostshould the player die anywhere in an unsafedeath. Thus it is recommended that players retrieve their items as soon as possible if planning to continue dangerous activities. Dying in an activity with an Item Retrieval Service will let the player keep their three most valuable items (affected byskullandProtect Item) but not additional untradeable items, unlike standard deaths outsidePvPscenarios.

Retrieval fees can be paid usingDeath's Coffer. Fees will be first taken from the coffer and any remaining amount from your bank.
