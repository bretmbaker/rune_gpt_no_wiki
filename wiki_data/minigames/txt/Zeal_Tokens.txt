Upgrades[edit|edit source]

A player can imbue certain items with Zeal Tokens. Imbuing an item provides bonuses and appends an (i) to the item name.

Imbues from theNightmare Zoneare also available here. However, players who imbued their items at the Nightmare Zone cannot un-imbue their items for Zeal Tokens. For the purposes of imbuing, each Zeal Token is equivalent to 2500 Nightmare Zone points. The cost of imbuing is halved after completion of theHard Combat Achievements.

Imbuing an item provides extra bonuses and appends an(i)suffix to the item's name. Imbued items can be un-imbued, which removes the bonuses from the item and refunds 100% of the reward points used to imbue it.

Imbuing all available items would require a total of 3,950 reward points.
