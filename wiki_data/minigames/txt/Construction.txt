Constructionis amembers-onlyskillthat allows players to buildtheir own housesand provide furniture for them. To begin Construction, players must buy a house from one of theestate agents. A starter house will cost1,000, and will be inRimmington. A level 40Magicspell can then be used toteleportto the house, or ahouse tabletcan be used. Alternatively players can walk to Rimmington, where there is aportal(iconon themap) that will teleport players to their house.

The house starts off with only aparlourandgarden, but furniture and additional rooms can be built. To build, go to theoptionsmenu, selecthouse options, and set thebuilding modemode to on. Players will then see what looks like ghost-likehotspotswhere new objects can be built. See theConstructed itemslist for details on what you can build at what level.

Players can visit a friend's house if they are online and using the same portal. Players can also use the officialhouse partyworlds to make use of max level houses, assuming they are not ironmen, without having to build one themselves. Thehouse advertisementnext to the portal showcases said houses.

Servants[edit|edit source]

All servants are able to greet guests entering a players' home, but some will have different abilities, such as taking items to and from thebankorsawmill. The higher level servant a player has, the faster their service is, the better food they provide, and the more items they can carry to or from a bank or sawmill.

After using a servant's services seven times, the servant will ask the player to pay them. After using a servant's services eight times, the player is required to pay them or the servant will quit. A player can build aservant's money bagand put coins in it to automatically pay their servant.
