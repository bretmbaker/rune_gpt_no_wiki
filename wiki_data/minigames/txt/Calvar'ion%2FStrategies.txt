Calvar'ion is a level 264skeletonboss. It is the weaker variant ofVet'ion, sharing similar mechanics and drops, but with reduced stats and in asingles-plusarea. The mediumwilderness diaryis required to fight Calvar'ion. If the hard wilderness diary is not completed, there is a 1.8 second teleport delay if attempting to leave the arena.

How to get there[edit|edit source]

Calvar'ionresides in theSkeletal Tomb, the entrance of which is located north-east ofFerox Enclavein theGraveyard of Shadows. There is a small tombstone where the player may drop into his chambers, requiring a fee of 50,000 coins to enter which can be taken from the bank. This fee decreases by 10,000 for every kill for the player who deals the most damage. The fee is not required again on subsequent trips unless the fee is lost to another player.

To get there quickly, you can:

Teleport toGraveyard of Shadowswith theCarrallanger Teleportor using ateleport tablet.Teleport to theFerox Enclavewith the minigame teleport of aring of dueling.Teleport toCorporeal Beast's Lairwith agames necklace(Beware this exits into multi-wilderness).

Attacks and abilities[edit|edit source]

Calvar'ionhas several attacks and abilities identical toVet'ion:

Magicattack: Five bolts of lightning strike various tiles across the arena, much like theGrotesque Guardians' lightning attack. Each lightning bolt deals damage in a 3x3 area, but any tile that is about to be struck glows, giving players the chance to dodge the attack. When soloing, one bolt will always target the player's tile or an adjacent tile, while four more will target random tiles around the arena. One bolt will appear for every player in the chamber, capped at seven.Hellhounds: Upon reaching half health, Calvar'ion will summon twoskeletal hellhoundsto attack players. They attack with melee, so activateProtect from Meleewhen they spawn or keep it active during the fight. They will provide him with complete damage immunity while present. He will do the same again in his enraged form.Shield Bash: Calvar'ion will raise his shield to bash an area in front or around and underneath him; shadows will appear forewarning the AoE of the attack. If the player doesn't move out of range, they'll take up to 26 damage and be unable to attack for the next 4.8 seconds. This attack is only used when in melee distance.Enraged Form: Upon losing all health in his first form, Calv'arion will summon orange lightning bolts (which share his standard lightning bolts' 3x3 area damage) in a circle around him and restore his health to full. In his second form, the hellhound mechanic is repeated, but he will die after losing all of his health in this form.

Strategies[edit|edit source]

Calvar'ion has the highest defensive capabilities of the three wilderness demi-bosses. However, his negative crush defence of -10 makes him fairly easy to hit.

All of Calvar'ion's attacks are AoE, meaning that if the player avoids them, they can essentially take no damage from his attacks. Calvar'ion will yell quotes whenever he attacks as a fairly easy and simple way to dodge the attacks. The shield bash is the only major concern due to its larger AoE, but is still otherwise easy to dodge since it is only used in melee distance.

When Calvar'ion reaches 50% of his health, he will summon skeletal hellhounds to assist him in battle. The hellhounds will channel immunity to Calvar'ion until they are killed. While they deal powerful melee hits, they are not durable, with both the normal and greater versions only having 30 health. Calvar'ion will yell a quote about their demise as an indicator that the immunity has been lifted.

When Calvar'ion reaches 0 health in his standard form, he will charge up lightning around him as he yells that the player defeated him a second time. The player can simply stand underneath him to avoid the reach of the lightning as normal. Calvar'ion will restore his health to full and increase his max hit and attack speed and any drained Defence levels will be restored.

Calvar'ion will move towards a player between attacks, so the player can manipulate him into walking towards the exit to his arena and keeping him there for the majority of the time. This is useful for players not relying on a "scout" outside the entrance to his tomb, as it ensures a fast escape, as getting teleblocked and frozen in the middle of the room will likely result in certain death from both the player killer's and Calvar'ion's attacks. It is still recommended to leave a secondary account if possible outside, as players cannot hop inside the tomb; and leaving one outside can sometimes cause other players to ignore whoever is inside.

Equipment[edit|edit source]

Always keep risk to a minimum in the Wilderness! -Whenever gearing, check yourItems Kept on Deathand enable "Wilderness beyond level 20" to make sure important items will not be lost.

The most effective equipment listed below involves a great deal ofTrouver parchmentsand raw risk, butMOST players will prefer a low-risk setup without parchment loss.Thanks to the powerfulSalve (e)effect, as long as you bring a strong weapon and 2-3 other high-bonus items, your DPS will be very good with little risk. For a low-risk setup, a Neitiznot, myth cape, and d'hide/proselyte are perfect, risking less than one average boss kill's-worth. From there, Barrows gloves then Dragon boots make great upgrades to the Rune gloves and Climbing boots budget setup.

That being said however, due to the incredible passive effect of theUrsine/Viggora's chainmacestacking multiplicatively with the Salve's bonus, every extra bit of strength and accuracy bonus from equipment will noticeably increase DPS, provided you are willing to risk more. For example, bringing even just one parched item, the Fighter torso (l) for +4 strength, can grant up to 3 additional max hits. These highly multiplied bonuses, coupled with the fact that it is possible to log out mid-fight here, make Calvar'ion the most feasible and rewarding of all the wilderness bosses to bring additional risk to. To be totally clear, theexpensive armour slots are only worth bringing IF players are confident in their ability to escape PKers or teleport out in time.

Lastly, when figuring out your setup, keep in mind that some of these equipment recommendations, such as theAvernic defenderandInfernal cape, are meant to maximize4-item protection. These can easily be downgraded if they would be risked, or if the player is not usingPK Skull Prevention. Due to the hazard of being smited and having theProtect Itemprayer disabled in combat, untradeable items locked with Trouver parchments are particularly effective as the 4th item kept on death, in order. Again, whenever in doubt, "Items kept on death" will show exactly how items are kept, degraded, or lost.

Note: Due to the Salve bonus not stacking, fighting on a skeleton (or hellhound!)Slayer taskwith aSlayer helmetwill not provide as high of an offensive bonus as the Salve amulet (e) will, and is not free to reclaim like the amulet.
