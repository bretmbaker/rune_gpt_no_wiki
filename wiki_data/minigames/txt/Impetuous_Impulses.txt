Map



Impetuous Impulsesis aminigamebased around theHunterskill. In the minigame, players captureimplingswhich are flyingimp-like creatures that can be caught to obtain trinkets and treasures that they have been stealing from all overGielinor. This activity takes place in an area calledPuro-Puro.

Requirements[edit|edit source]

Quests[edit|edit source]

If players wish to make use of the permanent portal to Puro-Puro found on Zanaris, completion ofLost Citywill be required. Having partial completion ofFairytale II - Cure a Queenis recommended in order to gain access tofairy rings. No quest is required however to gain passage to Puro-Puro through one of the crop circles that roam the surface of Gielinor.

Skills[edit|edit source]

A player will need at least level 17Hunterto enter the minigame area as well as to catch the lowest tiered impling. Higher Hunter levels will be needed to catch higher tiered implings.

Having a highStrengthlevel is also recommended, as this will assist the player in pushing through the rows of magical wheat that form the maze's wall. A highMagiclevel can be beneficial when casting spells such asentangleordark lureon implings.

Equipment[edit|edit source]

Abutterfly netandimpling jarsare needed to catch implings. Once in Puro-Puro, players can speak to theElnock Inquisitorwho will give the player a rundown of the game, the maze, and the implings. He will also give the player a butterfly net, 7 impling jars, and animpling scrollwhich shows the number of implings of each type that the player has caught. Afterwards, more jars can be obtained from the inquisitor by trading in jarred implings (seeElnock's Exchange), or alternatively by purchasing up to ten jars on offer each day in exchange for gold coins.

Note:Players will still need to bring impling jars with them when catching implings barehanded in Puro-Puro, and implings caught that way will not be instantly looted (see the section oncatch mechanics).

Amagic butterfly netgives a higher chance at catching implings than the normal version, and can likewise be procured from the Elnock Inquisitor.

Players may choose to bringweight-reducing clothingfor the purpose of sustaining the chase for longer, and optionally mix in pieces ofmagic armourfor a greater chance at successfully binding or luring implings using magical means. If available, other performance-enhancing items such as aring of enduranceorstamina potionsalso come recommended.

The hunting ground[edit|edit source]

Entering Puro-Puro[edit|edit source]

The minigame is located inPuro-Puro. To access Puro-Puro, the player can go through the maincrop circleinZanaris(located in the middle of a wheat field, east of thefairy ring). There are also other crop circles that randomly appear in wheat fields around Gielinor. The current location of the migratory crop circle can be found by talking to thewandering implingwho loiters inside the wheat field of Zanaris (players may evade the small talk by selecting the right-click "Check-gates" option).

Farmer's Affinity[edit|edit source]

The Farmer's Affinity bonus allows faster movement through wheat for 30 minutes. The effect this bonus has is to speed up pushing throughmagical wheatby exactly 3 ticks compared to the normal push time. This means that the fastest push will now take 3 ticks (1.8 seconds), compared to the normal fastest push of 6 ticks (3.6 seconds). The slowest push will now take 7 ticks (4.2 seconds), instead of the normal 10 ticks (6 seconds).

To receive the bonus, players must enter Puro-Puro via a crop circle in a specific wheat field on Gielinor, the location of which is revealed by the aforementioned wandering impling. The timer continues to run after leaving Puro-Puro, so it is possible to enter a crop circle to get the bonus, leave, then re-enter via the Zanaris wheat field and benefit from whatever bonus time remains.

The maze[edit|edit source]

The area in which the minigame takes place in is a maze. The walls are made of magical wheat and to travel between different layers of the maze, the player needs to right-click the "Push-through" option. Players will be able to push through the wheat more efficiently with the aforementioned Farmer's Affinity bonus, in addition to possessing a higherStrengthlevel.

If desired, the player can choose to enable receiving Strength XP by asking Elnock for more information about the wheat. Theminimap, due to the magical nature of Puro-Puro, will not display anything while engaged in this activity.

Parts of the maze's walls will randomly lower and then grow back. This allows the player to run around the maze without needing to push through the wheat. These sections are shown in the map below:

Implings[edit|edit source]

Types[edit|edit source]

Almost all of the implings that players can catch using the Hunter skill can be encountered within the wheat maze while participating in Impetuous Impulses. The sole exception is thecrystal impling, which may only be caught within the walls ofPrifddinas.

Name | level(barehanded) | GEPrice (jar) | AverageLoot Value[d 1]

 | Baby impling | 17 (27) | 1,725 | 65.52

 | Young impling | 22 (32) | 1,972 | 140.42

 | Gourmet impling | 28 (38) | 4,265 | 271.45

Spawns[edit|edit source]

On Puro-Puro, there are 35 spawn points that produce an invisible NPC which roams for two minutes before manifesting, and respawn immediately upon capture. The tier of these invisible NPC's determines which specific implings can appear after the two minute invisibility window fades (for the tables of possible implings that are rolled by each of the three tiers of spawn, see the main article). Of these 35 spawn points, there are 21 low-tier spawns, 12 mid-tier spawns, and 2 high-tier spawns:

Icon | Type | Respawn

 | Low-tier spawn | 2 min.

 | Mid-tier spawn | 2 min.

 | High-tier spawn | 2 min.

In addition, there are 51 fixed spawns of specific low-tier implings found throughout Puro-Puro. These spawn directly as implings rather than first spending a brief time invisible, and have a set respawn time of 50 ticks for the earth and essence implings, and of 7 ticks for all other varieties:

Icon | Type | Respawn

 | Baby impling | 7 ticks

 | Young impling | 7 ticks

 | Gourmet impling | 7 ticks

 | Earth impling | 50 ticks

 | Essence impling | 50 ticks

 | Eclectic impling | 7 ticks

Strategies[edit|edit source]

Force-spawning[edit|edit source]

The best method to find the rarest and most valuable implings is to force-spawn them.

In Puro-Puro, higher tier implings (nature implings and above) can be found much more commonly than on Gielinor. This is because, as seen above, Puro-Puro has two specific points which only spawn high-tier implings.

As an example, to maximise the amount of dragon implings spawning, a player will want to catch all rare implings (nature, magpie, ninja) as these will have spawned from the higher tier spawn tiles, giving them a chance for a dragon impling to spawn. This is best done at either the north-west or south-east corners of Puro-Puro, and it is advised to hop between multiple worlds because of the 2 minute "respawn"-timer for these higher tier implings.

Catch mechanics[edit|edit source]

Players must wield abutterfly netormagic butterfly netand have an emptyimpling jarin their inventory to be able to catch implings, the impling caught will be placed into the jar which can then be opened or sold on theGrand Exchange. Players can also catch implings barehanded and without an impling jar if they are 10 levels above the requirement for catching that impling (for example,ninja implingsbarehanded requires level 84 Hunter instead of the normal 74). Implings caught barehanded will be looted immediately if the player is on the surface of Gielinor. Barehanded catching will only work in Puro-Puro if the player has a jar in their inventory, in which case it will be stuffed into the jar rather than immediately looted. Grabbing an impling with your bare hands has the same success rate as attempting to catch one with a magic butterfly net.[1]

Spells such asBind,Snare, orEntanglecan be used to freeze an impling in place, making it significantly easier to catch them.Dark Lurecan likewise be used to draw an impling to the player. After tagging an impling successfully with one of these spells, players have a few seconds of grace during which other players cannot attempt to catch the tagged impling.

Imp defendersare located throughout the maze and are supposed to free their captured brethren as they feel some kinship towards the implings. Bringing along someimp repellentdecreases their chances of freeing an impling.

Elnock's Exchange[edit|edit source]

Players can trade in specific combinations of impling jars toElnock Inquisitorin exchange for items that are helpful for capturing implings.
