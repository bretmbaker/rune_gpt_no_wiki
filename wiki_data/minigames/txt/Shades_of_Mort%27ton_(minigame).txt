Gameplay[edit|edit source]

Loar Shades[edit|edit source]

Acombat levelof at least 81 is recommended to avoid being targeted by theLoar Shadeswhilst building the temple and cremating the shade remains. Loar Shades are tenacious. Once a shade targets a player, it can be lured through the entire length of the wandering path and halfway throughMort Myre Swampbefore the shade is forced to turn back at a predetermined boundary. They will also actively wander toaggroon to a player from far distances and around objects. Mort'ton is asingle-way combatzone, however other shades in the area will still aggro towards the player and tend to line up while waiting for the player to finish combat. The shades also appear in large numbers throughout the town which makes avoiding them difficult. When many players are at the temple, such as on World 377, the shades are less problematic for lower combat players since their aggression will be dispersed.

Note for Ironmen:You can accessFiyr Shadeson the hard paths inBurgh de Rott Rambleby starting a hard run inBurgh de Rott. You will often have an encounter right away in Mort'ton with several of the shades. If you don't get an encounter in Mort'ton, you can instantly teleport back to Burgh de rott with theMorytania Legs 3and try again. You can getFiyr remainsvery easily this way allowing you to skip the need for low level keys; you can getSilver keysor evenGold keysthis way.

Building/defending the temple[edit|edit source]

Players will first need ahammer,imcando hammer, orFlamtaer hammerto build the temple, with the Flamtaer hammer being significantly better. Aflamtaer bagis recommended to save inventory space as it can hold up to 60timber beams, 60limestone bricks, and 500swamp paste. Aflamtaer braceletis highly recommended to speed up the building andsignificantlyincrease the speed at which Sanctity is gained.

When starting, three figures will appear in the top-right corner of the screen:

Repair State- Indicates the condition of the temple, and is therefore shared among players. This value is raised by repairing the temple walls, and will gradually fall as shades attack and destroy them.

Resources- Represents the player's personal supply of building materials. All of these can be bought fromRazmire KeelganinMort'ton. As the player repairs the temple, their resources will be consumed. 5% resources are added for each set of the following items used:1 xTimber beamorplank- Players can buy beams fromRazmire's builders storeor planks from the Grand Exchange.1 xLimestone brick- Can be bought from Razmire's builders store or the Grand Exchange, or crafted fromlimestoneusing achisel, both of which are also sold by Razmire.5 xSwamp paste- Can be bought from Razmire's store, but is relatively expensive. Plenty of swamp paste can be received from the chests in theShade Catacombs, so rarely will there be a need to buy much if opening the chests. Swamp paste is also an occasional thank you gift when "curing"afflictedresidents (seeSerum 208below). It can also be made from combiningswamp tarandflour.

Sanctity- A resource required to makesacred oilandSerum 208. Each player has their own level of Sanctity, which starts out at 0%. It increases by repairing or reinforcing the temple, or by killing the shades around it. When building the temple, approximately 5% Sanctity is earned for each 1% of resources spent, while killing the nearby shades will grant 2% Sanctity per kill. The player loses 1% Sanctity per minute, and will have their Sanctity reset to 0% upon log out. Repairing with aflamtaer braceletequipped is recommended over killing shades due to its comparably higher Sanctity gain. Killing the shades is only recommended for players with high combat so as their Sanctity gain from kills doesn't get too offset from the natural drain.

Note: The temple occasionally goes through a phase of 'resetting', where any attempts to repair it are outpaced by the walls decaying. In this case, it is advised to wait it out for a few minutes until repairing is possible again.

Sanctifying the oil[edit|edit source]

Sacred oilis created by sanctifyingolive oil. Olive oil is sold in Razmire's general store or can be obtained by using serum on the afflicted. The olive oil must be sanctified by using it on thefire altarin thetemple. This process requires the player to have at least 10% Sanctity, with each sanctification costing 0.9% of Sanctity per dose of olive oil (2.7% for a 3 dose vial, 3.6% for a 4 dose vial). It is recommended to decant the olive oil into 4 dose vials before bringing them to save on inventory space.

Serum 208[edit|edit source]

Serum 208is created by using aSerum 207on the temple's fire altar. Doing so requires the player to have at least 20% Sanctity and costs 5% Sanctityper dose. Serum 208 can be given to theAfflictedthat wander the town to temporarily cure them, and they will reward the player with some coins and other small gifts. Both serums can be used to cure the Afflicted, however Serum 208 yields a greater reward, including the occasional Bronze key.

Creating the pyre logs[edit|edit source]

Shade remainscan only be cremated using pyre logs, which can be created by usingsacred oilon various types oflogs, providing a small amount of Firemaking experience. The table below shows what kind of pyre logs are required to burn which kind of shade remains, as well as the dosage of sacred oil required in creating them. The amount of Firemaking experience gained from cremating shades is increased by 50% upon the completion of theMorytania Elite Diary.

Killing the shades[edit|edit source]

To kill theshades, the player must first have access to them.Loar shadesare accessible by default as they just wander around Mort'ton and the temple. The other Mort'ton shades, however, are primarily found in theShade Catacombsjust north-west of the town, or as possible encounters during theTemple Trekkingminigame. To get to these shades, players will need various types ofkeysto get through the different doors. Fortunately, higher level keys will open the matching type of door as well as any lower tier door. For example, a steel key will open steelandbronze doors. The keys will not disintegrate when passing through the doors. For more information about the levels of keys and how to get them, seeCremating the shades.

Shades are classified as undead, therefore theSalve amuletand its imbued forms will boost accuracy and damage when fighting them.

Bleached bonescan be saved fromundead zealots(who rarely appear when unlocking chests) to fully restore prayer points at theShade Catacombs altar.

Because getting a key for the later areas can take some time, it is recommended for players to have at least one key of their highest accessible tier in the bank.

Shade | Combat level | Key needed

Loar shade | 40 | N/A

Phrin shade | 60 | Bronze key

Riyl shade | 80 | Steel key

Asyn shade | 100 | Black key

Fiyr shade | 120 | Silver key

Urium shade | 140 | Gold key

Cremating the shades[edit|edit source]

Once a player has shade remains and the appropriate pyre logs, they can cremate them by clicking on afuneral pyrewith atinderboxin their inventory; this will automatically place the pyre logs and shade remains, prioritising the highest tier log in the inventory. To manually cremate shade remains, the player must do the following:

Place pyre logs on any of the funeral pyres located around the south and west edge of Mort'ton.Place the shade remains on top of the pyre logs.Click the pyre to light it.

An animation of a shade's spirit will float up into the air, then either a key or a stack ofcoinswill appear on the pedestal nearby. The type of key depends on the type of shade remains used. The number of coins are roughly equal to theHigh Alchemyvalue of the item the player would have gotten from the key's corresponding chest. Players can leave the reward on the pedestal and then collect them all at once, however, they can despawn should the player take too long. Both keys and coins will despawn in 5 minutes (if no new coins are spawned to refresh the coin stack timer).

All shades, except Loar Shades and Urium Shades, give keys of two metals - low tier trims (red/brown/crimson) for the higher tier metal and high tier trims (black/purple) for the lower tier metal. The amount of coins and type of key per remains is shown in the table below. TheFractionindicates the probability to obtain that metal key from that type of shade remains. For example, black keys are obtained fastest by burning riyl remains (0.665 > 0.282), and silver keys are obtained fastest by burning Fiyr remains (0.634 > 0.508).

Each shade remains has a 0.21 chance of yielding coins, otherwise a key is obtained instead.

Shade remains | Coins | Low metal keys | Fraction | High metal keys | Fraction | Minimum log tier

 | Loar | 200-300 | N/A | N/A |  | 0.79 | Normal

 | Phrin | 400-500 |  | 0.125 |  | 0.665 | Normal

 | Riyl | 600-700 |  | 0.125 |  | 0.665 | Willow

 | Asyn | 800-900 |  | 0.282 |  | 0.508 | Yew

 | Fiyr | 2000-4000 |  | 0.634 |  | 0.156 | Magic

 | Urium | 2000-7000 |  | 0.79 | N/A | N/A | Redwood

Prayerexperience is gained by burning the shades. The amount depends mainly on the type of shade cremated, and to a lesser extent on the type of log used. The experience obtained from each combination is shown in the table below. The amount of Prayer experience gained from cremating shades is increased by 50% upon the completion of theMorytania Hard Diary.

Type of log | Loar | Phrin | Riyl | Asyn | Fiyr | Urium

 |  |  |  |  | 

 | Normal | 25 | 37.5 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A

 | Oak | 33 | 45.5 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A

 | Willow | 33.5 | 46 | 61 | N/A | N/A | N/A

 | Teak | 33.7 | 46.2 | 61.2 | N/A | N/A | N/A

 | Arctic | 33.9 | 46.4 | 61.4 | N/A | N/A | N/A

 | Maple | 34 | 46.5 | 61.5 | N/A | N/A | N/A

 | Mahogany | 34.3 | 46.8 | 61.8 | N/A | N/A | N/A

 | Yew | 34.5 | 47 | 62 | 79.5 | N/A | N/A

 | Magic | 35 | 47.5 | 62.5 | 80 | 100 | N/A

 | Redwood | 35.5 | 48 | 63 | 80.5 | 100.5 | 120.5

Unlocking the chests[edit|edit source]

Once you have your keys, you can go into the catacombs and unlock the chests which the keys open. The entrance to the catacombs is north-west of town, a little north-east of the bridge, through some doors built into the north side of a hill. Look for a torch on the bank of the swamp.

Each time you unlock a chest, the key will dissolve in the lock. If you want to come back and fight more of the shades in a certain area,make sureyou save at least one key to get back through the doors with. Again, it might be a good idea to leave one key in your bank when you finish, in case you want to come back and play again later or are killed to retrieve your gear.

To open a chest, match up the colour of the key with the lock of the chest, such as a Steel Key Black with a steel-trimmed chest with a lock painted black. If you're not sure the colour of the lock, you can examine the chest for more info. Once opened, the player will be rewarded in various loot (see#Unlocking chestsbelow).

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Sacred Oil[edit|edit source]

Players often play the minigame to getsacred oil, which can be utilised to create pyre logs for cremating shades or sold to other players. For more on selling sacred oil for profit, see themaking sacred oilguide.

Experience[edit|edit source]

The Shades of Mort'ton minigame provides a variety of experience, primarily inCrafting(repairing the temple),Prayer(burning shades), andFiremaking(burning shades). Repairing the temple is one of the cheapest methods to gain Crafting experience, but at around 12 experience points a second (withflamtaer hammer) it is very slow for the money saved. Players can also gaincombat(killing shades) andHerblore(creating serums) experience.

Unlocking chests[edit|edit source]

The intended rewards from this minigame come from using theshade keyson chests in theShade Catacombs. These chests contain a variety of rewards that vary greatly in value. Inside the chest will usually be a few coins and one main reward which includesrunes,armour, or aclue scroll. There is frequentlyswamp pastein the bottom of the chest as well. The tiers of armour and clue scrolls depend on the type of key:

Bronze chestsyieldSteeltoMithrilitems andeasy clue scrollsSteel chestsyieldSteeltoAdamantitems andmedium clue scrollsBlack chestsyieldBlacktoAdamantitems andmedium clue scrollsSilver chestsyieldBlacktoRuneitems andhard clue scrollsGold chestsyieldAdamanttoDragonitems andelite clue scrolls, as well asZealot's robes

Additionally, the colour of the loop defines the probability of the key yielding one of the more valuable items available. The order, from worst to best, is:

Red < Brown < Crimson < Black < Purple

For example, aSilver key blackismore likelyto yield a better treasure than aSilver key brown, but all silver keys have theexact sameset of possible rewards. Purple keys will have the highest chance of receiving a clue scroll.

The amount of coins received from a chest partly depends on the other loot you obtained from the chest; if you receive expensive loot, you will receive less coins.

The exact coin drop mechanics are as follows:

The integerRandomRollis rolled between the following bounds:

Bronze chest: 400 - 600Steel chest: 900 - 1100Black chest: 1500 - 2000Silver chest: 3600 - 7000Gold chest: 4500 - 9500

The integerMainLootValueis thevalueof the main loot. For each item, the value can be found in the infobox on its page. This value is then multiplied with the received quantity. For example, 15death runeshave a value of15*180=2700, and a singlebronze lockshas a value of800.Swamp pasteandflamtaer bagsarenotincluded in this value.

IfMainLootValue≥RandomRoll, no coins are dropped.

IfRandomRoll≥MainLootValue, the amount of dropped coins is⌊RandomRoll−MainLootValue3⌋.

Uniques[edit|edit source]

In addition to the various loot obtained from the chests, there is also a chance to receive various unique rewards:

Item | Info
