[Minigame: Barrows_equipment]

Barrows equipmentrefers to a number of sets of combatequipmentfound in theBarrowsminigame. There are six sets of Barrows equipment: four forwarriors, one forrangers, and one formages. Each set has four pieces: a two-handed weapon (except forAhrim's Staff, which after an update was changed to be a one-handed weapon like other staves in an effort to buff the weapon), a helmet, a torso piece, and legwear. When all four pieces for a particular brother are equipped, aspecial set effectis granted, which is different for each set. Additionally, theamulet of the damnedenhances the set effects while equipped. Barrows sets cannot be made using theSmithingskill.

TheBarrows gloves, which also resemble a piece of Barrows armour, are not obtained through the Barrows minigame and instead can be purchased after full completion of theRecipe for Disasterquest.

Degrading and repairing[edit|edit source]

Barrows equipmentdegradesas it is used. Equipment received from theBarrowsminigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades, but will lose all stat bonuses when it becomes fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names. It will becomeitem name 100the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade toitem name 75, then50, then25and finally0at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired (armour that reaches 0 whilst being worn will stay worn until removed, but cannot be reequipped if removed until repaired). Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded.

Each quarter consists of 250 degradable points, and cause the item to decay into the next named degradation state once they are fully depleted. A piece of barrows equipment will immediately degrade when the player enters combat, and deduct one more point from the total if the player is still in combat after 90 ticks (54 seconds) have passed.[1]

When dropped, any piece of Barrows equipment willautomatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this.

There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or players could repair the pieces themselves using anarmour standin anyplayer-owned house. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The base repair cost of an item is determined by its internal degradation state (out of 1,000), multiplied by 100 coins when repairing a weapon; 90 coins when repairing a body slot item; 80 coins for a leg slot item; and finally 60 coins for a helmet.[2]

The following NPCs can repair the armour:

Bob- the axe seller inLumbridgeTindel Marchant- the weapon and armour repairman atPort KhazardDunstan- the smith inBurthorpeSquire- in the workshop area of theVoid Knights' OutpostAneirin- the armour seller inPrifddinasBlacksmith- the blacksmith ofCivitas illa Fortis

It costs less to repair Barrows equipment at an armour stand compared to paying an NPC. Stat boosts do affect the price of repair. The formula used to calculate the cost at a repair stand is:

CostAS=CostNPC×(1−Smithing Level200)

A player with aSmithinglevel of 60, for instance, would pay 70% of normal cost:

1−60200=70100

Simply put, every 2 Smithing levels reduces the repair cost by 1% when compared to an NPC vendor. At level 99 this equals roughly 50% in savings.

Barrows equipment stacks in bank with the correspondingitem degradation, so if aKaril's crossbowhas a degradation level of 100, it will stack with another Karil's crossbow if it also has a degradation level of 100. The item with the same degradation level will be taken out with the same amount of hits as before, so if a Karil's crossbow 100 has 180 ticks left before it will go to level 75 degradation, and that same one is in a stack with another crossbow that has 900 ticks before it will degrade further, the one you take out of the stack will be the one with 180 ticks left.
