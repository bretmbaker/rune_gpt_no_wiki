[Minigame: Melee]

The termmeleeis used to describe theAttack,StrengthandDefenceskills. Melee is one of the threecombat classesinOld School RuneScape. It involves usingswords,daggers, and otherweaponsto damage opponents, as well as wearing heavyarmourmade from various metals. Players who specialise in this type of combat are known as warriors.

Thecombat triangledictates that warriors are strong againstrangersbut weak againstmages. Melee's inability to attack from a distance means that a player may have a hard time fighting a ranger or mage, as they can make use ofsafespots. However, melee armour has a high resistance to ranged attacks, making warriors effective against rangers.

Attack types[edit|edit source]

Meleecombathas threeattack types:crush,stab, andslash.

Melee attack[edit|edit source]

To the right of theInventorybutton (below the Inventory button in the mobile client), is theEquipmentmenu. From here, players can view theircombat Stats. Meleeweaponsincrease in accuracy as the minimumAttacklevel, required to wield the weapon, increases. The general trend is that Melee weapons of the same "tier" have the same accuracy value.melee armourdoes not hinder the accuracy of Melee weapons, nor does it improve Melee accuracy, aside from a few items such as thewarrior helm. However, wearing a piece of ranged or magic armour, instead of the melee counterpart, reduces the effectiveness of melee combat. Melee weapons and armour, certainamulets,capesandringsprovide a Melee attack bonus.

Players can also use Meleeprayerssuch asPietyto improve Melee combat.

Melee skills[edit|edit source]

Attackdetermines the accuracy of a player's Melee attacks and the types ofweaponsa player may wield. The higher theAttacklevel, the fewer misses a player will incur during Meleecombat. As Attack is a vital skill in Melee combat, increasing one's Attack level will increase one'scombat levelassociated with Melee.

Strengthis a Melee combat skill which increases the amount of damage a player can inflict in Melee combat by one point per level. Additionally,Strengthmay be required to wield certain weapons and armour, access someAgilityshortcuts, and complete severalquests.

Defenceis one of the primary combat skills that grants players protection in all forms of combat. The higher theDefencelevel, the fewer successful blows an opponent will land against the player. Defence is thus a vital skill for enduring attacks for long periods of time. A player's Defence level also determines theequipmentthey are able to wear, as most pieces ofarmouror other equipment have a Defence level requirement.

Melee weapons[edit|edit source]

Meleeweaponsfit into many general categories. No type is superior to others, they vary inattack style, and speed/damage. In general, weapons of the same tier have the same damage per second ratio, with two-handed weapons dealing approximately 50% more damage per second.

Daggers[edit|edit source]

Daggersare tied in speed with thescimitarandshortsword, and generally the cheapest of all Meleeweapons. They can also bepoisoned; thedragon dagger (p++)is a very popularspecial attackweapon in general fighting andPvP. A dagger is the first weapon that players cansmithupon gaining access to a newmetal.

Swords[edit|edit source]

Swordsare able to inflict more damage than adagger. A sword is a cheap alternative toscimitarsforruneand lowermetals.

Longswords[edit|edit source]

Longswordsare slower thanscimitarsanddaggers, and the same speed asmacesbut they have higherStrengthbonuses than all three. Although their speed is slightly slower than scimitars, the extra Strength bonus andspecial attackfor thedragon longswordmake it comparable to them.

Two-handed swords[edit|edit source]

Two-handed swordsare the most powerful of basicweapons, but it sacrifices both speed and the ability to be used with theshieldslot, as the name suggests. The use of arune two-handed swordinplayer killingonfree-to-playworlds as a finishing weapon is common.

Scimitars[edit|edit source]

Scimitarsare very popularweaponsthat can hit just as fast as ashortswordordagger, and they deal slightly more damage than shortswords but less thanlongswords. Scimitars are, however, generally more expensive than the dagger and do not carry themace'sPrayer bonus. Thedragon scimitaris considered one of the most versatile combat weapons in the game.

Maces[edit|edit source]

Maceshit just as fast as a scimitar but usecrushandstab. Maces are unique among other weapons of a givenmetalin that they carry aPrayer bonus, which makes them useful for those who make heavy use ofPrayer, such as tanks. Thedragon maceis mainly used inplayer killingdue to itsspecial attack.

Warhammers[edit|edit source]

Warhammersare powerfulweaponsthat utilise mainlycrushattacking style. They are not commonly used because of their low speed and mediocreStrengthbonuses. They offer the same damage as theirslashingcousins, thebattleaxes.

Battleaxes[edit|edit source]

Battleaxeshave slightly higherStrengthbonuses compared to awarhammerof the samemetaltype, and they use bothslashandcrushattack styles. They are stronger thanlongswordsyet slower. They are also weaker thantwo-handed swordsandspearsbut attacks faster than them.

Halberds[edit|edit source]

Halberdsare two-handedmembers-onlyweaponsequally strong (and slow) astwo-handed swords. They have the unique ability to reach over small obstacles such as tables, fences, othersafespots, etc.

Spears[edit|edit source]

Spearsare two-handedmembers-onlyweaponsthat arestabbingequivalents oftwo-handed swords. They are still arguably the most flexible weapons in the game, as they are the only weapon to usestab,crush, andslashattack styles. Spears, however, only offerControlledandDefensiveattack styles. They can also bepoisonedexcept theZamorakian spear.

Hastas[edit|edit source]

Hastaearespearsthat may be used with ashield. TheZamorakian hastaonStabworks ideal againstdragonsand bosses, such as theCorporeal Beast. Similar to their two-handed brethren, spears, they arepoison-able, except the Zamorakian hasta, and flexible, which means possessing theStab,Crush, andSlashstyles, and they also can only be used to trainControlledandDefensiveattacks.

Claws[edit|edit source]

Clawsaremembers-onlyslashingweaponsthat take up theshieldand theweaponslot. The speed of claws are equal to that ofdaggers, and they have higher bonuses.

Abyssal whip[edit|edit source]

Theabyssal whipis a very popularweaponamong higher levels that is functionally similar to ascimitarin terms of speed, and has a high strength bonus. However, players cannot use the whip to train Strength effectively as it only hasaccurate,controlled, anddefensivestyles and lacks theaggressive attack style.

Hatchets/Pickaxes[edit|edit source]

Axesare intended forWoodcuttingandpickaxesforMining. Although they may be used for melee combat, it is not recommended as thedragon axeandpickaxeare very expensive, and they have low speed and accuracy.

Melee armour[edit|edit source]

Bronze armour[edit|edit source]

Granite armour[edit|edit source]

Granite armouris a not so popular choice of armour, requiring not only aDefencelevel of 50 to wear, but also aStrengthlevel of 50 due to its weight. Thegranite bodyandhelmethave slightly better bonuses than theirrunecounterparts. Granite is rarely used due to its scarcity and weight.

It also provides a notable Prayer bonus.
