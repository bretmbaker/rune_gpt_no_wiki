Aclue boxallows a player to keep a singleclue scrollorreward casketon death in theWildernesswhen it is held in their inventory. It can be purchased fromJustine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standingfor 5Last Man Standingpoints. A scroll/casket protected by a clue box is keptin additionto other items normally kept on death. However, a clue box isalways lost on death, even if the box would normally be kept, and also even if it didn't protect a scroll/casket.

Only the bottom-right most scroll/casket is protected (carrying multiple clue boxes does not produce additional effects). TheItems Kept on Deathinterface does not distinguish the scroll/casket a clue box would protect. However, the interface does indicate that the box would always be lost.

Clue boxes do not protect clues forUltimate Ironmanplayers.

It is recommended to avoid opening areward casketin the Wilderness while holding a clue box, as the clue box will still be lost on death along with any non-protected items gained after the casket is opened.

If you die with both a clue scroll and atorn clue scroll, both will be protected.

Cost vs. risk assessment[edit|edit source]

To determine if a clue box is worth holding, its value must be weighed against the potential value of the scroll/casket it protects. If it is more valuable than the average expected value of the item it protects, it should not be taken. The table below compares the average expected value of each tier of reward casket against theGrand Exchangevalue of a clue box (239,250) accordingly.

Reward casket | Avg. value of loot | Profit if killed once | Recommended

 | Hard | 172,143.49 | −67,106.51 | No

 | Elite | 416,526.73 | 177,276.73 | Yes

 | Master | 880,898.20 | 641,648.20 | Yes

This recommendation may not be reliable for players who can obtain new clue boxes more quickly than the scrolls/caskets they would protect, or players looking to fill slots in theCollection Log(such players may value the potential reward rolls more than the Grand Exchange value). Conversely, aniron playerwho struggles with theLast Man Standingminigame may never choose to use a clue box as the effort may be better spent on obtaining another clue scroll.

It also must be considered that the cost or effort put into obtaining a clue box itself may be better spent on equipment or supplies used to prevent death in the first place. Althoughruneandblack dragonhidearmour combined and high-healing foods may not guarantee a saved scroll/casket every time, they may be more cost or time efficient in the long run.
