The primary use of a silver bar is to createjewellerywith theCraftingskill. To craft silver bars into jewellery players must use a silver bar on a furnace with a propermouldin their inventory. If players wish to craft jewellery withgemsinset, the cut gems must be present in the player's inventory before crafting the jewellery. One silver bar is used during theCreature of Fenkenstrainquest, and another duringShadow of the Storm.

Unlikegold bars, which cannot be made into weapons, silver bars can be made intosilver sickles. They can also be ground tosilver dustin theEctofuntusgrinder for use as an ingredient in theguthix balancepotion.
