Map



Last Man Standing, commonly referred to asLMS, is aplayer-versus-playerbattle royale styleminigamein which the player, along with 3-23 others, are transported onto an island where they must fight for survival, killing each other and looting any items they can to become the titular last man standing.

Players can begin the minigame by speaking toLisa, located inFerox Enclave. Itemscannotbe brought into the minigame; any items in the player's possession are temporarily taken away for the duration of the game, and are returned upon leaving the game. Alternatively, abank deposit boxnear Lisa can be used to deposit all of the player's items.

Upon speaking to Lisa, players will be given the choice to participate in one of three game modes:

Casual- Players can participate without reward and can begin a game with four players, though their rank on the highscores are not affected.Competitive- Only playable onmembers' worlds, players are rewarded points for playing and their rank on the highscores are affected. There must be 24 participants to begin a competitive game. After a game of competitive, the players rating will get updated and displayed in the chat window.High Stakes- Like competitive mode, but players must pay 500,000 coins to enter. This game mode is not always active; it is enabled by the Old School Team at their discretion. High Stakes cannot be played byIronmanaccounts.

Participating in Competitive and High Stakes requires players to have a minimumtotal levelof 750 and 30Quest points, or a minimum total level of 1,500 if they have less than 30 Quest points.

Official worlds[edit|edit source]

Unlike most minigames, Last Man Standing can only be played on certainworlds. It should be noted that there are no differences in gameplay between free-to-play and members, as the items used within the minigame, which includes various equipment usually exclusive to members, cannot be brought outside. This makes the minigame the only place where free-to-play players can performspecial attackswith the weapons provided and useAncient Magicks.

As with otherPvP worlds, Last Man Standing worlds are oftenrotatedto provide fairerlagassociated with ping/server latency to players across the world. The current active PvP world rotation isRotation B.

Gameplay[edit|edit source]

A map of Desert Island with marked locations | A map of Wild Varrock with marked locations

At the start of the game, a map is chosen from the map pool at random. Currently there are two island maps available (Desert Island and Wild Varrock), with a 50% chance of either being chosen.

Players can choose their preferred account build via a Settings button on the screen when in the lobby. Players can choose between 3 different account builds: Max/Med, Zerker, and 1 Def Pure.

Build | Attack | Strength | Defence | Magic | Ranged | Hitpoints

Max/Med | 99 | 99 | 75 | 99 | 99 | 99

Zerker | 75 | 99 | 50 | 99 | 99 | 99

1 Def Pure | 75 | 99 | 1 | 99 | 99 | 99

Upon arrival to the island, an account build is randomly chosen for all players, with a higher chance given to builds preferred by more players in the waiting area. All prayers (excludingRedemption, Smite,PreserveandRetributionand excludingRigour,Augury,PietyandChivalryfor the zerker and 1 def pure builds) can be used, and the player's spellbook is switched to theAncient Magicks, even ifDesert Treasure Iis not completed. In addition, players are given infiniterun energyas well as infiniteprayer. Once the player arrives, the game will begin in 12 seconds.

Upon killing a player, the player's stats, run energy,special attackand supplies are all replenished. Players will also receive abloody key(or abloodier keyif there are fewer than six players), which they should use on achestto receive more powerful equipment. During this time, players are also unattackable for 20 seconds, giving them time to find a chest to loot as well as preparing for the next fight against another player.

Items found within the island have differentitem IDsthan their normal counterparts. If players somehow were able to smuggle these items outside the minigame and attempt to use them, they would disappear instantly.

Players can logout or use therowboats in Desert Islandto forfeit a game. Players forfeiting will not receive any rewards. Forfeiting three times a day will ban that player from playing Competitive or High Stakes for the rest of the day until tomorrow.

Upon arriving, players are given a default set of items based on the account type they selected. This includesSuper restore,Super combat potion,Saradomin brew,Ranging potion, and, by default, a uniquerune pouchthat can castBlood Blitz,Blood Barrage,Ice BlitzandIce Barrage. Thesupply chestjust west of Lisa allows players to arrange their inventory, equipment loadout, andspellbookto their personal preference. It should be noted that players cannot have more than eleven sharks and two cooked karambwans for their loadout, and cannot be picked up from a slain player's loot if they have that same amount of food. Players can choose between theStandard Spellbook,Ancient Magicks, andLunar Spellbookin the supply chest, giving access to theSurge spellsandEntangle, Ice and BloodBlitzandBarrage spells, andVengeanceandCure Merespectively. The Lunar Spellbook cannot be activated for Pure builds.

To improve the chance of survival, players must lootcheststhroughout the island withbloody keysandbloodier keys. Chests opened with bloody keys will roll for an item from two loot tables, one of which contains offensive gear, and the other defensive, while bloodier keys access an upgraded offensive loot table. If an opponent logs out before they are killed, the attacker will still receive a bloody/bloodier key.

There will also beloot cratesthat may spawn throughout the map; the chat box will broadcast its location to all remaining players. These loot crates can roll on the upgraded loot table.[1]

Fog[edit|edit source]

After a minute, the game will broadcast that lethal fog will soon fill the island, and the safe zone that players must travel to, in order to avoid damage from the fog, which will be indicated byfog markers(appearing as glowing orbs) and a yellow arrow.

After 2 minutes and 30 seconds, greater fog will activate. Players less than 16 tiles into the fog will take 1-3 damage every other tick, ramping up over 6 ticks. Players 16 or more tiles into the fog will be subject to greater fog, which can deal up to 10 damage every other tick.

Players who aren't in the safe zone after 10 minutes will take rapid damage, beginning at approximately 1 damage per tick, but steadily increasing to 10 damage per tick.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Casual rewards[edit|edit source]

Playing a casual game yields no rewards.

Competitive rewards[edit|edit source]

In competitive games, players are given a certain amount of points based on their performance in a game:[2]

1st place - 5 points2nd place - 4 points3rd/4th place - 3 points5th-9th place - 2 points10th-19th place - 1 point

Bonus Points (do not stack with each other):3 kills - 1 point5 kills - 2 points

Note:Players must kill at least one player before being awarded any points.

These points can be exchanged for reward items atJustine's reward shop,Justine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standing. Each point is worth up to84,650.00.

High stakes rewards[edit|edit source]

For high stakes games, the sole survivor of the match will win 7,500,000 coins and the runner-up is awarded 2,500,000 coins, which is put into achestnearJustinewhere it may be claimed anytime by the player. For players in third to fifth place, they will have their next high stakes game free of charge.

Since a minimum of 24 players are needed to enter the game, 12,000,000 coins are put into the match. 10,000,000 of that are redistributed to the first two players and three players get free access to their next game, removing 1,500,000 coins that are put into a single match, meaning that Last Man Standing acts as a money sink with a minimum of 500,000 coins leaving the game per high stakes match.

Ranking[edit|edit source]

Players have a rank that starts at 500, and can decrease, increase, or stay the same depending on their performance each game.
