Barbarian Assaultis acombatminigameplayed in the basement of theBarbarian Outpost. A team of five players must work together in different roles to battle ten waves of monsters before finally defeating thePenance Queen. There are no requirements to play, but players with a highercombat levelwill generally perform better due to the aggressivePenance creaturesin the arena.

While the minigame has a reputation for being complicated, players can expect to learn and complete each of the various roles within a couple hours. Players looking to complete theKandarin hard diarywill need to complete one full game, and players looking to complete the elite diary will need to reach level five in all four in-game roles.

The minigamedoes not provide any combat experience for any action. Additionally,runesandammunitionare not allowed inside the arena as they are instead provided in-game, andprayersare disabled.

Ultimate Ironmenshould note thatlooting bagsandrune pouchare not allowed into the game, even if they are empty.Hardcore Group Ironmandeathswillresult in losing a life. Players are unable to trade while in a game.

Introduction[edit|edit source]

The Barbarian Assault minigame is played on a battleground underneath the Barbarian Outpost, which was established by the Barbarians to fight againstPenancecreatures. Players can complete thetutorialby talking toCaptain Cainin order to get a basic understanding of how the minigame is played.

Players must form a team of five players in order to enter a game. There are four roles in total: attacker, defender, healer, and collector. One role will have two players; this can be any role, but it is typically the role of healer or attacker. Each role is needed to help the rest of the team complete a wave. If a teammate leaves or is killed at any time, the entire group must restart the wave from the beginning. Players must play the ten waves in order.

Completion of each wave will reward each player withhonour pointsspecific to the role they chose. Honour points can be used to purchase a variety of combat-based equipment, such as thefighter torso, known for itsStrength bonus. Players can also gamble their points for a chance to receive thedragon chainbodyor thePenance Queen pet.

Players can check how many honour points they have earned by talking toCommander Connadnear thebank chest, or by checking theblackboard.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

The Barbarian Assault arena can be found at theBarbarian Outpost, just north ofBaxtorian Falls. There are several methods by which players can get here:

Games necklaceteleport— the quickest way to reach theBarbarian Outpost.Grouping teleport— after completing the tutorial, players are able to teleport directly there through thegroupinginterface.Barbarian Teleport— the level-75Lunar spellteleports the player directly to the Barbarian Outpost, requiring 3fire runes, 2astral runes, and 2law runes.Tree Gnome Strongholdagility shortcut— at level 37Agility, players can scale the tree to the north-east of the Tree Gnome Stronghold. Completion of theThe Grand Treequest is required to use this shortcut.Enchanted lyre— the lyre allows players to teleport toRellekka, then approach the Outpost from theLighthouse.Player-owned house— players with houses located at Rellekka can use thehouse teleportand then follow the same route as the enchanted lyre teleport method.Fairy ringteleportALP— players can use the ring to teleport to the Lighthouse just north of Outpost.

Gameplay[edit|edit source]

Forming a team[edit|edit source]

Players must either form or join a team to begin playing. They can either do this by entering a room that corresponds to the wave they're trying to complete and then interacting with other players, or by joining the "arrow room," which automatically matches players together. Playersmust have completed the tutorial at least onceto enter this area, and must haveAccept Aidon to join a team. From here, players may choose either the role of attacker, collector, defender, or healer.

A player wishing to be a leader must obtain arecruitment scrollfrom the table, and use it on any four players (as long as those players are not in a group already). When a leader requests a player to join their group, the player will be able to choose their role and see the other team members. The recruiting leader will see the player's level in their currently selected role, and will be able to accept or decline their offer. The recruiting leader must also select their own role by right-clicking the scroll and selecting "write-role."

Waiting for an open role instead of recruiting is generally recommended for players with a highcombat level, as recruiters tend to avoid players who they think might die easily. If trying to be recruited, it is suggested that the players either mention their levels in their chosen role, or wearPenance armourin order to show that they are experienced in the game.

After each wave, the leader can decide whether or not to keep the team they're playing with. If a player does not fit the leader's requirements, or does not help out the team, they may wish to kick the player; leaders looking to kick a player from the team can use the scroll on the player in question, and then click the redXnext to their name. The role the player was occupying then becomes free, allowing the leader to pick another person.

If none of the teammates leave or are kicked from the team after completing a wave, the next wave will start automatically after 60 seconds.

There are many ways to notify the people in the room that you are trying to recruit or be recruited. The following terms are often used.

Term | Meaning | Example

"[Role] here" | A player is willing to join a team as said role. | Attacker here

"Lvl [#] [role] here" | A player is willing to join a team, and is experienced in their selected role. | Lvl 3 defender here

"[Role] to go" | A player is leader of a group and needs said role to start the next game. | Collector to go

[Letter]2g | Same as "[role] to go." 2g is shorthand for "to go." The first letter of each role is used. | H2g

Lf [role] | Same as "[role] to go." Lf is shorthand for "looking for." | Lf Defender

Need [role] | Same as "[role] to go." | Need attacker

Calling and the horn[edit|edit source]

For each role, players will have to communicate to their teammates what strategy to use, in a process known ascalling. Calling is done by right-clicking and selecting the correct command from thehornthat appears in a players' inventory after starting each wave. Players must act according to their teammates' calls, or will be unable to complete their role's tasks.

Calling is themost importantpart of any role; players should always prioritise calling so that each role can help defeat the Penance. If one person doesn't call for their team, other teammates will similarly be unable to complete their roles. The Penance change their weaknessesevery 30 seconds, so the player should always be quick to call for their teammate and adjust their strategies.

At all times, players will see the following graphic on the top right of their screen:

The interface shows what needs to be called inwhitetext, which changes toyellowonce players have called correctly. This makes it easy for players to see if they either haven't called, or if they've called incorrectly. As mentioned before, this will change every 30 seconds.

The following table explains each symbol:

Icon | Meaning | Example or action

 | The current assault wave. | Players starting out will see "Wave 1"

 | What you have been told toDO. | Defenders seeing "Tofu" should use tofu for bait.

 | What toCALLthrough your horn. | Attackers seeing "Red egg" should right-click the horn, and select "Tell-red".

 | Yourpartner'srole, with whom you communicate. | Healers will see "Defender."

Players in need of healing can right-click the horn and selectMedicto notify the healer on their interfaces.Note that manually typing out "Medic!" does not notify the healer.

Roles[edit|edit source]

Each role has an active task that players must complete alongside their responsibility to call to another player. The following table briefly describes each role:

Role | Calls to | Description

Attacker | Collector | Attacks monsters through combat, using the style called by the collector.

Collector | Attacker | Collects eggs based on the call of the attacker, then places them in the egg cannon. Can also convert eggs.

Defender | Healer | Lures therunnersto traps that kill them, using the bait called by the healer. Can also build barricades and repair traps.

Healer | Defender | Uses poisoned food to kill thePenance Healers, based on the call of the defender. Can also heal other players.

Monsters[edit|edit source]

Other than the queen, all monsters will appear in caves on the northern side of the caves. Each of them dropred,green, andblue eggsupon death, which can be picked up by the collector. A greater number of every type of Penance will spawn in subsequent waves, and the enemies that spawn in higher waves will be stronger, thus making the final waves more challenging than the first.

Note:in Barbarian assault, the term "healer" refers both to a player who holds the healer role and thePenance Healermonster. For clarity, this page will use "healer" or "healer role" to describe therole, and "Penance Healer" will describe themonster.

The following table shows all monsters in the game:

Image | Name | Fought by | Aggressive? | Other functions or notes | Spawn | Max hit

 | Penance Healer | Healer | Yes (poison) | Can heal runners. | NE | 2

 | Penance Runner | Defender | No | Runners head to the southern caves, costing the team points if they manage to enter. | NE | N/A

 | Penance Ranger | Attacker | Yes | Rangers do more damage than fighters, and should be targeted first. | NW | 9

 | Penance Fighter | Attacker | Yes | Fighters do less damage than rangers, and should be targeted second. | NW | 8

 | Queen Spawn | All | Yes | Anyone can attack the queen spawns, without needing to follow the called style. | NE | 7

 | Penance Queen | All | Yes | The queen canonlybe damaged by theomega egg. | Centre | 13

Note that while different monsters have different amounts of health depending on the wave, runners will always have 5 Hitpoints.

Other items[edit|edit source]

Item | Basic description

Horn | Used to call to other players.

Machines | Machines will dispense each role's respective items (aside from the collector, who uses it to convert). They can be clicked on at any time by players looking to restock.

Egg launcher | The egg launcher launches eggs at all enemies. Any player may fire it, and doing so willnotcause the player or the team to lose honour points. It can be used to assist teammates in need of help. The launcher does much less damage than individual roles can do, but can help teammates assist the last remaining role in the wave.Red eggs deal 3 damage to a creature, and cause either 0 or 1 splash damage to monsters within 3 squares.Green eggs deal 1 damage to any creature and inflict poison which deals an additional 1 damagefivetimes before wearing off.Blue eggs stun any creature for 6 seconds. Most teams will advise players not to launch blue eggs, as it can slow down the wave.

Omega egg | The omega egg is launched at the queen in order to damage her. It must be created with the participation of all team members.

Horn of Glory | This large horn is situated in the south-east corner of the battlefield, and can be used to contact everyone at once. If a player often forgets to call, this horn can be used by anyone to tell any teammate what they have to do. The horn will be unusable after the Penance Queen appears in the 10th wave, as calls are no longer needed at that point.

Points[edit|edit source]

Players earnhonour pointsfor their roles; additional information on the specifics of how points are earned can be found in the Barbarian Assaultstrategy guide. Players will get 10% more points (rounded down) if they have completed theHard Kandarin Diary. Each team member gets points based on the team's performance plus points based on their own role. A player failing to call does not incur a direct immediate penalty, but may result in penalties for the entire team due to them not knowing the right actions to perform.

Although players may get negative points for their individual performance in your role, team points are capped at a minimum of 0 points. Total points for a wave are also capped at a minimum of 0 points.

Points for wave 1-9

Role | Aspect | Formula | Capped at

Attacker | Rangers killed | y=x-1 | X is capped by spawns

Attacker | Fighters killed | y=x-1 | X is capped by spawns

Attacker | Incorrect style attacks | y=-x+1 | Y is capped at -10

Collector | Eggs collected minus exploded | y=x/4.35 | X is capped at 60

Defender | Runners killed | y=1.8x | X is capped by spawns

Defender | Runners that got past | y=-3x | Y is capped at -10

Healer | Healers killed | y=0.7x | X is capped by spawns

Healer | Players hitpoints replenished | y=x/18 | Y is capped at 28

Healer | Wrong poison packs used | y=-x/4 | X is capped at 512

For completing wave 10, each player gets 80 points for their role plus 5 points in each of the other 3 roles instead of the formulas above.

Action | Result

Escapedrunner | Each runner that reaches the southern caves will subtract 3 honour points from everyone's final score, for maximum penalty of 10. A single runner may escape several times, until it is killed. Points lost are doubled for defenders.4 or more escapes have the same effect on team honour.

Wrong attack style | Each wrong attack will subtract 1 honour point from everyone's final score, for a maximum penalty of 10. If attackers use the wrong style, they will also suffer 2 recoil damage for each wrong hit.11 or more wrong attacks have the same effect on team honour.Attackers haveonefree "wrong hit" per wave. Any additional wrong hits will be penalized.

Wrong egg picked up | The count of exploded eggs is subtracted from number of eggs collected, and decreases by the number of collected eggs (up to 60) minus the number of exploded eggs. As the egg explodes, it also causes the collector to take 5 damage.Unlike in other roles, collectors cannot provide negative honour to the team directly, only by calling wrong attack styles to attacker.

Wrong food used on aPenance Healer | Using wrong types of poisoned food on Penance healers will subtract honour points by the count of wrong poison packs used divided by 4, rounded down, for a maximum penalty of 10.40 or more wrong poison packs used have the same effect on team honour.

Machines[edit|edit source]

The dispensers located at the southern end of the battlefield (near where players appear) provide some necessities for each role.

Machine | Name | Used by | Dispenses

 | Attacker item machine | Attacker | The following items have the same effect:Blunt arrows•Earth runesField arrows•Water runesBarbed arrows•Fire runesBullet arrows•Air runesIn addition, the followingcatalytic runesare also given:mind,chaos,death,bloodandwrathrunes.

 | Defender item machine | Defender | WormsTofuCrackers

 | Collector Converter | Collector | Green eggsconvert toRed eggsRed eggsconvert toGreen eggsBlue eggsconvert toGreen eggs

Penance Queen[edit|edit source]

On Wave 10, thePenance Queenwill spawn. The queen can only be harmed withomega eggs, which the team members must work together to make.

The battlefield will have a different layout than Waves 1 through 9; there will be only one egg launcher instead of two, and a large trapdoor will appear in the middle. There are alsopoison craters(also called poison springs),lava craters, andpetrified mushrooms(also called spiked mushrooms) dotted around the edges of the battlefield, which are used to create the omega eggs.

The Penance Queen will appear from the trapdoor when all other penance are defeated or 4 minutes have passed in the wave, and will attack players with a long-distanceRangedattack that simultaneously hits all five team members for up to 13 damage. The queen will also use a melee attack on players who run close enough. She can also spawn level 63queen spawns, which attack with melee and can be defeated by any team member with any attack style.

The Penance fighters, rangers, healers, and runners must all be defeated by the team before they can start launching omega eggs to defeat the queen. During this final wave,there are no point penaltiesfor mistaken actions, such as attacking with a wrong style or using an incorrect type of poison food, but the creatures that appear during this wave still must be defeated using the correct calls.

The queen spawns ayellow eggevery six seconds; these must be collected and used to make the omega eggs.Eighttotal hits from the omega eggs are needed to kill the queen.

Omega eggs are made according to the following sequence, which can easily be remembered with the acronymCHAD:

Role | Action | Give to ("use" option)

Collector | Collectyellow eggs. | Healer

Healer | Dipeggsinpoison craters. | Attacker

Attacker | Attachspikesfrompetrified mushrooms. | Defender

Defender | Dipeggsinlava craters. | Collector

Collector | Puteggsin the egg hopper. | Launchand kill the queen!

Once the omega eggs are loaded and all other Penance monsters are defeated, all team members can use the egg launcher to launch the eggs at the Penance Queen and kill her.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Honour pointscan be used to increase the level of each role, exchanged for combat equipment, or gambled. Players gain honour points at the end of each successful wave based on their performance in their role and the team's overall performance. With each successive wave, players earn more points as the difficulty increases. Upon killing thePenance Queenin the last wave, players will receive 80 honour points in their role and 5 points in the other 3 roles. Players can access their rewards by speaking toCommander Connadand accessing hisrewards shop.

Players may upgrade the level in a particular role from level 1 up to level 5. By upgrading their levels, players gain extra abilities such as extra damage or higher healing. Obtaining the maximum level in all roles is one of the requirements needed to complete theElite Kandarin Diary. A total of 1,400 honour points are needed to obtain a level 5 role. 5,600 points are required to obtain level 5 in all roles. Points cap at 5,000 in each role.

A summary of the level upgrades for each role may be found in the following table:

Level | Honour Points | Collector | Healer | Attacker | Defender[D 1]

1 | N/A | Bag holds 2 eggs | Heals 10 hitpoints | +1 bonus damage | +4 luring range spaces

2 | 200 | Bag holds 4 eggsConversion chance ~20% | Heals 15 hitpoints | +2 bonus damage | +5 luring range spaces

3 | 300 | Bag holds 6 eggsConversion chance ~40% | Heals 20 hitpoints | +3 bonus damage | +5 luring range spaces

4 | 400 | Bag holds 7 eggsConversion chance ~60% | Heals 25 hitpoints | +4 bonus damage | +5 luring range spaces

5 | 500 | Bag holds 8 eggsConversion chance ~85% | Heals 35 hitpoints | +5 bonus damage | +5 luring range spaces

Players can purchase Penance armour using their honour points. Certain items require the player to kill thePenance Queen. Points from all roles are required.

Item | Pricesold at | Pricebought at | Queen

 | Fighter hat | 275 each role | 220 each role | Yes

 | Ranger hat | 275 each role | 220 each role | Yes

 | Healer hat | 275 each role | 220 each role | Yes

 | Runner hat | 275 each role | 220 each role | Yes

 | Fighter torso | 375 each role | 300 each role | Yes

 | Penance skirt | 375 each role | 300 each role | Yes

 | Runner boots | 100 each role | 80 each role | No

 | Penance gloves | 150 each role | 120 each role | No

 | Granite body | 95000 | N/A | Yes

The total amount in points for a Penance armour set (one hat, gloves, boots, torso, and skirt) is 1,275 points in each of the four different roles. For all items, one would need 2,100 points in every single one of the four different roles, 95,000coins, and 7 queen kills.

If players have Penance gear they no longer need, they can use it onCommander Connadto receive a point refund equal to 80% of the purchase price; any queen kills spent will not be refunded. Players hoping to complete thecollection logfor Barbarian Assault only need 590 points in each role, assuming the most expensive item required is purchased and immediately sold.

Players can gamble their points in either a low, medium, or high gamble, in exchange for various resources, armour, and thePenance Queen pet. These gambles are known on mobile as "lucky dips."
