TheWise Old Mancan assign various tasks onmemberworlds and give small rewards in return.

The most common tasks are to fetch between 3 and 15 of one of the following items (this list may not be exhaustive). They can be brought in more than one batch. The Wise Old Man doesn't acceptbank notes, as they have no use to him. In addition, the Wise Old Man will only give tasks that match the player's current level. For example, he will not assign the player to fetch 15anchoviesif the player does not have level 15Fishing.

There are 59 tasks in total that can be assigned, each of which is allotted an equal weight.[1]That said, the Wise Old Man will not request an item if theadventurerlacks the skill to create it themselves.
