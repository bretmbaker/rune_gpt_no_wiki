Quest series[edit|edit source]

ManyOld School RuneScapequests are a part of a series of quests that share a common plot-line.

Progress in a quest series is made in a linear fashion, with each quest requiring the completion of the previous one. There are, however, a few exceptions to this progression, and are found usually when a quest is involved in multiple plot-lines.

The majority of the quest series are based out of a specific area, and their completion is often needed to access either more of that area or specific features within it. For example,West Ardougneas a whole is inaccessible unless at least some progress is made in theElf seriesof quests.

Subquests[edit|edit source]

Asubquestis a part of another quest, which upon completion gives additional rewards as well asquest point(s). Subquests may take less time and require fewer items, although they may have additionalskillor quest requirements.

Recipe for Disasterhas ten subquests (one for the recipe, one for each member of theLumbridgecouncil, and the final one for theCulinaromancerboss fight).

Miniquests[edit|edit source]

Miniquestsare smaller pieces of story and skill content that are not required for the quest point cape, but still tell stories similar to quests. Most miniquests are smaller in scale and shorter than a normal quest, but may have requirements stretching higher than normal quests or none at all. Many are connected to existing pieces of content or used to tie up loose ends from quests.
