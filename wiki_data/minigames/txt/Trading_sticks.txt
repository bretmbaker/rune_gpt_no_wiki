Trading sticksare the main currency of the jungle village ofTai Bwo WannaionKaramja. They can be received by participating in theTai Bwo Wannai Cleanupminigame, selling items toGabooty's Tai Bwo Wannai Cooperative, or killing Karamja-related monsters such asjogres.

Acquiring trading sticks[edit|edit source]

Players receive favour with the villagers of Tai Bwo Wannai by participating in theTai Bwo Wannai Cleanupminigame. If players talk to the villagers and tell them they've done some work, they will give the player some trading sticks in exchange for some of the player's favour. Wearing pieces of thevillager clothingset will cause the villagers to give you more trading sticks at once in exchange for favour. This is the most efficient way to get trading sticks since players can also train several skills while playing the minigame.

Note: Players need to have repaired the fence in the village and then spoken toMurcailybefore the villagers will have the option to give them trading sticks.
