Miningis askillthat allows players to obtainoresandgemsfromrocks. The higher a player's Mining level is the more likely they are to successfully extract ore. With ores, a player can then either smeltbarsand makeequipmentusing theSmithingskill or sell them for profit. Mining areas are identified with a regular pickaxeicon, andmining shopsare identified with a gold pickaxeiconon theminimapandworld map.

How to mine[edit|edit source]

The player can click onrocksin amineto mine them, as long as they are wielding apickaxeor have one in their inventory. After mining for a short amount of time, the player will obtain anoreor agemstone, depending on the rock mined. Ores can be used forSmithing, and gemstones forCrafting. Rocks cannot be mined with a full inventory.

Every mining cycle, there is a chance to succeed and obtain an ore. Using a higher-tier pickaxe can increase mining speed by reducing the time to the next mining cycle. The chance of success each cycle varies by ore and increases with the player's Mining level.

Pickaxes[edit|edit source]

Pickaxes, or "picks," are needed to minerocks. They can be equipped as aweapon, giving players one extra space in theirinventory. Pickaxes cannot be made using theSmithingskill. Pickaxes can be bought frommining shopsor from other players.

A player's Mining level determines the type of pickaxe they can mine with. Higher-level pickaxes grant more frequent opportunities to obtain an ore from arockbut do not impact thesuccess rateof doing so. As such,tick manipulationcan be used to bypass the pickaxe mining speed.[1]

Other equipment[edit|edit source]

Besidespickaxes, the following items have some effect on mining:

Parts ofprospector outfitincrease Mining experience rates.Varrock armourprovides a 10% chance to mine two ores of certain types (depending on tier) simultaneously, giving experience for both ores.Mining capeprovides a 5% chance of receiving an extra ore while mining ore up to adamantite, giving experience for both ores.Mining gloves,Superior mining glovesandExpert mining glovessaves certain rocks from becoming depleted for a number of times after an ore is mined.Thebracelet of claycausessoft clayto be obtained fromclay rocksrather than rawclay, and doubles the yield fromsoft clay rocks.Thecelestial ringprovides an invisible +4 boost to the player's Mining level. This boost does not allow the player to mine ore above their Mining level. When charged withstardust, it gives the player a 10% chance to obtain an extra ore from rocks up toadamantite.Theelven signetoffers a 10% chance to prevent thecrystal pickaxefrom consuming a charge when an ore is mined.Thecelestial signetcombines the effects of the celestial ring and the elven signet.Coal bagstores up to 27coal, possibly improving mining efficiency.Gem bagstores up to 60 uncut gems of eachsapphiretodragonstone, possibly improving efficiency when mininggem rocksor perhaps even inMotherlode Mine.A chargedamulet of gloryincreases the chances of randomly findinggemswhile mining from 1/256 to 1/86. It also significantly boosts mininggem rocks.Ring of wealth (i)doubles the chance to receiveclue geodeswhen in theWilderness.

Mineable items[edit|edit source]

Ores are obtained from the different types of rocks, usually found inmines. On theminimap, mines are labelled with a grey pickaxe. The colour of a rock corresponds to the ore's colour.

When players click on a rock, they will hit it with theirpickaxeand try to get the ore out. Higher-level rocks such asmithrilandadamantitetake longer to mine and may require some patience.

After the ore has been mined, the rock will turn grey for a while. Eventually the ore willrespawnand the rock will regain its colour. Players can only mine a rock when ore is available. Ore respawn times differ with the difficulty of the rock. For example,runite rockstake 12 minutes to respawn whileiron rockstake about five seconds.

Gems[edit|edit source]

A gem table has a 1/256 chance to roll on every mining attempt;[2]if the player is wearing a chargedamulet of glory,amulet of glory (t), oramulet of eternal glory, the probability increases to 1/64.2.[3][4]If the table successfully rolls, the player may receive an uncut gem or nothing, and in either case can not receive an ore.[5]This neither depletes the rock nor grants mining experience.

Special mining areas and activities[edit|edit source]

Mining Guild[edit|edit source]

TheMining Guildis a special mining area within the dwarven mines, requiring level 60 Mining to enter (can beboosted). While accessible byFree-to-playplayers, an area of the mine is accessible solely byMembers. There are numerous rocks in both sections, with especially large numbers ofcoal rocks.

Within the members' area of the mining guild, players will receive an invisible +7 levelboostto their Mining, and have a chance to receiveunidentified mineralswhile mining, which can be traded in for variousmining gloves. It also contains tworunite rocksand is the only place players can mineAmethyst. Players also have access to aBank chestto deposit their ores quickly.

Motherlode Mine[edit|edit source]

TheMotherlode Mine, requiring level 30 Mining and found within the dwarven mines, allows players to instead minePay-dirtand deposit it into a dwarven machine. When withdrawn, the player receives various random ores attainable at their current Mining level. This process also has a chance of rewardingGold nuggets, used to purchase helpful mining-related items such as theCoal bag,Gem bag, andProspector outfit, as well asSoft clay packsandBags full of gems.

Blast mine[edit|edit source]

TheBlast mine, requiring level 43 Mining and found withinLovakengj, allows players to collectBlasted oresthrough the use ofDynamite; the usage of which also rewards a small amount ofFiremaking experience.Blasted oresare then deposited to obtain various random ores; the blast mine is unique as players can receive ores that have level requirements up to ten above their current level.

Coal Trucks[edit|edit source]

Coal from the nearby coal rocks can be loaded onto the trucks, and unloaded inSeers' Village, which makes banking more convenient.

The rocks in this mine have a chance of yieldingcrystal shardsalongside the ore.

Volcanic mine[edit|edit source]

Players may mine ore fragments from a boulder in a volcanic chamber. This may be performed individually or in groups. In order to successfully mine here, players must maintain the stability of the mine, avoidlava beastsand navigate across pools of lava.

Shooting stars[edit|edit source]

Shooting Stars are aDistraction and Diversionin which a meteoroid falls from the sky approximately every hour and a half (90 minutes) across every in-gameserver. These appear asCrashed Starsthat can be mined forstardust, which can be exchanged ata shoprun byDusuriat theMining Guildentrance inFalador.

Zalcano[edit|edit source]

Zalcano is askilling boss. In order to defeat her, players must minetephra, refine it using theSmithingskill, imbue it using theRunecraftingskill, throw it at her and mine her once her armour is damaged enough.

Digsite[edit|edit source]

Various digs at the Digsite yield a variety of cheap or useless items and low amounts of experience. Thepanning activityyields a variety of inexpensive items (includingnuggets, three sets of which can be exchanged forgold ore), and minuscule amounts of mining andfishingexperience.

Cam Torum Mine[edit|edit source]

Cam Torum Mine's walls containcalcified rocks. When mined, these dropblessed bone shardsandcalcified deposits. Withblessed wineplayers can sacrificeshardsat aLibation bowl, yieldingprayerxp.

Ruins of Camdozaal[edit|edit source]

The deposits can be broken down on the nearbyBarronite Crusherto receive additional Barronite shards, ancient artefacts, or most notably, theImcando hammer (broken).  The Imcando hammer, when repaired with Barronite shards, can be wielded and used instead of a normalhammer.

Other uses[edit|edit source]

InCastle Wars, players can mine certain parts of the wall underground in order to fill the passageway with rocks. If other players are located under the rocks, they will be instantly killed.In theChambers of Xeric, the player's Mining level and the average Mining level of the team affect the damage onGuardians.Several passages are blocked by objects that have to be mined before they can be crossed, such as rocks in theAbyssand the entrance to theIce Queen's Lair.Mining is used to animate theearth elementalsthat dropelemental ore. Although no actual mining is involved, a pickaxe that the player has the Mining level to use is required.In Tombs of Amascut, mining is used in the puzzle of Het, with 85 mining being needed to guarantee a one-down of the pillar.

Tips[edit|edit source]

Power-mining[edit|edit source]

Also known asdrop mining, this is where a player fills theirinventorywith ores, drops them all, and repeats. While this method of mining allows players to raise their Mining level quickly, dropping a whole inventory of ores can take some time (although this can be minimised by making use ofshift-click dropping). Also, by using this method, a player would be missing out onSmithingexperience. Some locations useful for drop mining:

Al Kharid mine- The scorpions can beaggressiveat lowcombat levels.Dwarven MineBandit Camp Quarry- Players will be susceptible to damage fromdesert heatMining Guild- The ores in themembers-only section respawn twice as fast, allowing for non-stop iron mining.

There are currently 16 locations in Runescape that have three iron rocks in a triangle formation.

Al Kharid mine- The only location available to free-to-play players.Cam Torum mineEast Salvager Overlook mineIsle of Souls mine- Accessible viaSoul Warsminigame teleport or the Soul Wars portals at theFerox EnclaveorEdgeville.Legends' Guild mineLovakengj mineMining Guild- Members' area only. This is the preferred area to power-mine due to the iron rocks having a decreased respawn time. This mine has two spots with three iron rocks close together.Mount Karuulm minePiscatoris mineSisterhood Sanctuary mineStonecutter OutpostThe Stranglewood mineTrahaearn mineSouth Mor Ul Rek mineVerdant ValleyWilderness Resource Area

Mining gloves[edit|edit source]

Memberscan purchase two different types ofmining glovesfrom theMining Guild Mineral Exchange, a store run byBelonain theMining Guild. Each pair of gloves saves certainrocksfrom becoming depleted for a number of times after an ore is mined, which is very beneficial for players power-mining or mining higher tier ores. After purchasing both pairs of gloves, the player can combine the gloves to createExpert mining glovesby talking to Belona.

Item | Name | Effect

 | Mining gloves | Savesiron rocks,silver rocks,coal rocks, andgold rocksfrom becoming depleted one time.

 | Superior mining gloves | Savesmithril rocksandadamantite rocksfrom becoming depleted one time.Saves the rocks affected by mining gloves two times.

 | Expert mining gloves | Savessandstone rocks,runite rocks, andamethyst crystalsfrom becoming depleted one time.Saves the rocks affected by superior mining gloves two times.Saves the rocks affected by mining gloves three times.

Reduce total weight[edit|edit source]

Players are recommended to wear few items or nothing at all other than theirpickaxe.Memberscan wear theweight-reducing clothing. Wearing fewer items allows a player to run longer, as lessenergyis spent while running at lowerweightvalues.

Switch worlds[edit|edit source]

For higher level rocks such asadamantiteorrunite, it is often faster toswitch worldsrather than waiting for the rocks torespawn. This is not recommended for lower level rocks as they respawn much faster.

Mining pet[edit|edit source]

Therock golemis a members-only skillingpetthat can be obtained while trainingMining. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Mining level, and the time it takes to gather a resource.
