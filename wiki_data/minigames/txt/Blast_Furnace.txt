TheBlast Furnaceis a members-onlyminigamesituated inKeldagrimthat involvessmeltingbarsin bulk. Thefurnacehere only requires half as much coal compared to a usual one, which is useful when smelting high-tieroresthat require more coal.

Requirements[edit|edit source]

StartedThe Giant Dwarfto gain access toKeldagrim.2,500 coinsper 10 minutes of use.60Smithing(not boostable)allows you to skip this fee.Equipping thering of charos (a)will reduce the entrance fee to1,250 coins, if you go throughBlast Furnace Foreman's dialogue(1•3•2•3)…1323.On Blast Furnacethemed worlds, Coins must be deposited in thecoffernear the bank chest to pay the foremen operating the blast furnace, costing72,000 coinsper hour/1,200 coins per minute. The fee is time-based (12 coinspertick). Coins must be deposited in thecoffernear the bank chest to pay the fee. On all other worlds, there is no such fee (as the foremen are not present), but players must work together to operate the Blast Furnace.While bars will cool down on their own with time, wearingice glovesallows the player to retrieve bars directly and immediately.Alternatively, abucket of watercan be used at thebar dispenserto cool the heated bars immediately. An emptybucketspawn andwater sourcecan be found nearby. However, this approach is strongly discouraged, as it takes up an inventory space and increases interactions needed.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

The Blast Furnace is located inKeldagrim. To enter Keldagrim, the player must have started theThe Giant Dwarfquestby speaking to the Dwarven Boatman within the mines east of Rellekka. The map on the right shows a path the player can take walking fromSeers' Village/Camelotto the mines east of Rellekka. Once the player has visited Keldagrim at least once, they can return viamine cartfrom theDwarven Minesunder theIce Mountainor theGrand Exchange, or use theGrouping teleportto teleport right outside the Blast Furnace building.

TheFairy ringsystem can be used in two ways: Either travel to ringDKRto go immediately west of theGrand Exchange, use its underwall tunnel north of the ring (requires 21Agility) and then the mine cart, or travel to ringDKS, which puts the player a short walk to the south-west to the Keldagrim entrance.

Bank chest[edit|edit source]

Near the water pump and the coffer is a bank chest, which players can use to more efficiently use the furnace. Note that time spent with the bank chest interface openwilldeplete the coins in the coffer.

Official worlds[edit|edit source]

There are 15 Blast FurnaceworldsonOld School RuneScape, all of which make soloing the Blast Furnace easy as there are five different dwarves—Dumpy,Stumpy,Pumpy,Numpty, andThumpy—operating the mechanics of the Blast Furnace, so the player only has to focus on running the ores to the conveyor belt. There is an additional72,000 coinsfee per hour (12gp/tick) to use the Blast Furnace on these worlds, which is deposited in the coffer near the bank chest.

As ore and coal in the blast furnace are not lost when hopping worlds, it is possible to deposit ore onto the conveyor belt on a non-Blast Furnace world and pedal manually to deposit it into the melting pot, and then hop to a blast furnace world to retrieve bars without utilising the blast furnace coffer. Although this strategy reduces cost, the cost of using the official blast furnace worlds is minimal compared to the cost of the ores involved, making this highly impractical for nearly all players.

Experience rates[edit|edit source]

FullSmithingexperienceis gained from smelting thebars. There is also ananvilnearby to smith on, requiring level 60 Smithing to access.

At the Blast Furnace, the following Smithing experience rates can be gained producing bars. The tables assume that the player is wearingice glovesand, when applicable, has acoal bagorgoldsmith gauntletsin their inventory, leaving 27 inventory slots occupied by ore. Hybrid bar patterns utilise 26 inventory slots for ore, as they need both the coal bag and the goldsmith gauntlets.

For better rates, use the Barbarianvial smashperk unlocked throughAlfred Grimhand's Barcrawlwhen sipping energy restores and stamina potions.

Collecting raw materials[edit|edit source]

Raw materials can be obtained in two ways:

Havingorein thebank, using thebank chest.Buying ore fromOrdanwho runs theOre Sellershop (up tomithril). Ordan usually sells ore cheaper than GE price, putting them in high demand and causing players toworld-hopfor them. Therefore, Ordan's stock will often be diminished, especially withcoal, making it rarely profitable or advantageous to rely on it for on-site procurement.

Operating the Blast Furnace[edit|edit source]

Blast Furnace worlds[edit|edit source]

The official Blast Furnace worlds provide a great level of convenience and are the de-facto way to use the Blast Furnace. It is unlikely to find a player run furnace and, at most, the stations are used to train other skills.
The process for operating the Blast Furnace on an official world is as follows:

Placecoaland/ororeon the conveyor belt.Cool down smelted bars with abucket of water. This step can be skipped ifice glovesare equipped when collecting the bars.Collect thebarsfrom the bar dispenser.Bank.Repeat.

Manual operation[edit|edit source]

Manually operating the Blast Furnace requires 30 Agility, Crafting, Firemaking, and Strength. The process for operating the Blast Furnace manually is as follows:

Place coal and/or ore on theconveyor belt.Turn the conveyor belt by operating thepedals.Repair any brokencogs,pipes, ordrive beltusing ahammer.Collectcokefrom storage using aspadeto obtain aspadeful of coke.Refuel the adjacentstovewith the scooped-up coke.Operate thepump, while keeping the pipes repaired.Keep an eye on thetemperature gaugeto prevent the furnace from overheating.Cool down smelted bars with a bucket of water from thesink. This step can be skipped if ice gloves are equipped.Collect the bars from thebar dispenser.Bank.Repeat.

World Hopping[edit|edit source]

Using the no-payment world hopping strategy requires 30 Agility. The process for the World Hoppping strategy is as follows:

Hop to a world that is not an official Blast Furnace world.Load coal and/or ore on the conveyor belt. Load coal up to either the cap or the amount planned to be used if using coal, then load up to 28 ore.If necessary, repair the drive belt using a hammer, requiring 30 Crafting. TheImcando hammeris preferred to save an inventory slot. Alternatively, begin the process on a world with a non-broken drive belt.Do not change worldsto hop to one with a functioning drive shaft while you have ores on the conveyor belt, as they will be lost.Pedal for 4 ticks to deposit your ores into theMelting Pot.Hop to an official Blast Furnace world.Cool down smelted bars with a bucket of water from the sink. This step can be skipped if ice gloves are equipped.Collect the bars from the bar dispenser.Bank.Repeat the process with your desired pattern, bulk-loading coal, if needed, every few cycles depending on consumption rate

Notes[edit|edit source]

Caution:When smeltingsteel bars, make sure that coal is already loaded in the furnace, or at least depositedbeforetheiron ore. Otherwise, the furnace will yield iron instead of steel.Thecoal bagcan be filled straight from the bank by using the Fill option on it, which is accessible with a shift-click.The maximum amount of coal which may be placed in the Blast Furnace is 254 ores, or a little over 9 inventories.The maximum amount of primary ores (the metal itself) which may be placed in the Blast Furnace is 28, and another 28 bars may be stored at one time. Attempting to place more than 28 primary ores without collecting the 28 bars in the dispenser results in an error that says: "You should collect your bars before making any more."Logging out or disconnecting while only coal is upon the conveyor belt results in permanent loss of that coal. However, if the coal is paired with another ore, it will remain on the belt after disconnecting.If using ice gloves and goldsmith gauntlets, remember not to equip the ice gloves UNTIL the smelting process is complete and the experience drops. Doing so too early negates the gauntlets' bonus. For safety, equip the gauntlets again as soon as the bars are collected.On Blast Furnace activity worlds, the minimum amount of money required for a single run that should be deposited in the coffers is109 coinsif running, and217 coinsif walking. This requires standing north of the coffers and moving directly towards the conveyor belt on the same tick as depositing the coins.A token amount ofcontribution experienceis awarded to all participants when bars are dispensed during manual operation of the Blast Furnace.

Ordan the Ore Seller[edit|edit source]

TheOre seller., run byOrdan, is one of many of thestores in Keldagrimand can be found immediately west of the conveyor belt. The shop is restocked bydwarvesthat regularly enter the room and deliver a number (around 30) of one type of ore to the shop, rather than restocking 1 of every ore periodically. When the shop stocks 100 of a particular ore type the extra are "sent to storage".
