The Kitchen[edit|edit source]

Players will have to make three types of food based on the interface on the top-left corner of the player's game client:servery meat pie,servery pineapple pizza, andservery stew. The interface shows which food will gain more of the soldiers' appreciation, which gives a greater amount of Cooking experience. Empty bar means lower rewards and full bar means higher rewards. When one type of food is cooked and served, the appreciation for it will lower while increasing the appreciation for the other two food items. Players will have to obtain the ingredients and cook the food from the various areas within the Mess kitchen area.

Below are parts of the kitchen that can be interacted with in order to create the food to serve the soldiers:

Food cupboard. Containsservery flour,servery pineapple,servery potato,servery cheeseandservery tomato.Utensil cupboard. Containsservery dishes,bowls, andknives.Sink.

Strategies[edit|edit source]

Servery Meat Pies[edit|edit source]

Get 14 servery flours from the food cupboard and 14 bowls from the utensil cupboard. Fill the bowls with water at the sink.Repeatedly use the water on the flour, or vice versa, while holding the 1 key to make 14 servery pastry doughs. Use one of the bowls on the Utensil Cupboard to instantly return them all.Get 14 servery dishes from the utensil cupboard and use them on the servery pastry doughs to make 14 servery pie shells.Get 14 servery raw meats from the meat table and cook them all into servery meat.Use the servery meats on the servery pie shells to make 14 servery uncooked pies.Cook the servery uncooked pies.(Optional) If you plan to continue making meat pies, it's easy to withdraw-50 of either flours or bowls now to avoid Withdraw-X and typing out 14 again.Use the Servery Meat Pies on the buffet table.Switch to a different world so you don't have to deal with reduced appreciation and repeat.

Each full inventory will award approximately 2,300 Cooking experience, depending on appreciation. With perfect clicks, it is possible to get above 60,000 experience per hour using this method. At lower levels, expect to get around 48,000-55,000 experience per hour, depending on Cooking level and concentration levels. This method of training Cooking is outclassed in experience rates by servery stews, which only requires an additional five levels.

Servery Stews[edit|edit source]

Get 14 bowls from the utensil cupboard. Fill the bowls with water.Get 14 servery raw meats from the meat table and cook them.Combine the bowls of water with the servery meats to make 14 servery incomplete stews.Get 14 servery potatoes from the food cabinet and combine them with the servery incomplete stews to create 14 servery uncooked stews.Cook the 14 servery uncooked stews.(Optional) If you plan to continue making stews, it's easy to withdraw-50 bowls now to avoid Withdraw-X and typing out 14 again.Use the Servery Stews on the buffet table.Switch to a different world so you don't have to deal with reduced appreciation and repeat.

Each full inventory will award approximately 2,400 Cooking experience, depending on appreciation. With perfect clicks, it is possible to get above 72,000 experience per hour using this method. It is possible to achieve around 94,000 experience per hour by dropping the meat and unfinished stews before cooking them, and picking them up one at a time to use on the range. Cook the meat before filling the bowls for this method to work. At lower levels, expect to get around 60,000-69,000 experience per hour, depending on Cooking level and concentration levels. It becomes impossible to burn the servery stews at level 58 Cooking. Some players may find it advantageous to wait until those levels as a result.

Servery Pineapple Pizzas[edit|edit source]

Start by getting two knives from the servery utensil cupboard. Technically only one is needed, but by having only 26 slots in your inventory instead of 27, items can be taken from the cupboards without having to use the 'Take-X' option after the pizza base is made.Get 13 servery flours from the food cupboard and 13 bowls from the utensil cupboard. Fill the bowls with water. If you're able, you can castHumidifyto save some time here.Repeatedly use the flour on the water, or vice versa, while holding down the "2" button to make 13 servery pizza bases. Use one of the bowls on the Utensil Cupboard to instantly return them all.Get 13 servery tomatoes from the food cupboard and use them on the servery pizza bases to get 13 servery incomplete pizzas.Get 13 servery cheeses from the food cupboard and use them on the servery incomplete pizzas to get 13 servery uncooked pizzas.Get 13 pineapples from the food cupboard and use a knife on each of them to get 13 servery pineapple chunks.Cook the 13 servery uncooked pizzas.Use the pineapple chunks on the servery plain pizzas to get 13 servery pineapple pizzas(Optional) If you plan to continue making pizzas, it's easy to withdraw-50 of either flours or bowls now to avoid Withdraw-X and typing out 13 again.Use the servery pineapple pizzas on the buffet table.Switch to a different world so you don't have to deal with reduced appreciation and repeat.

Each full inventory will award approximately 5,000 Cooking experience, depending on the appreciation. With perfect clicks, it is possible to get above 200,000 experience per hour using this method. At lower levels, expect to get around 165,000-180,000 experience per hour, depending on the Cooking level and concentration levels. It becomes impossible to burn the servery plain pizza starting at level 68 Cooking. However, few pizzas are burned between levels 65 and 68, thus it is recommended to begin cooking pizzas right away.
