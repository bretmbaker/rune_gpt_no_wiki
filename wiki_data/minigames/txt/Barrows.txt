TheBarrowsis a series of six burial mounds east of Mort'ton in which theBarrows brotherswere entombed after their deaths during theThird Age. 'Barrows' also commonly refers to the minigame-like dungeon-delving experience of lootingthe chestat the centre of the tunnels beneath the crypts, released on9 May2005.

Players can attempt to rob valuable items from the Barrows brothers' crypts. However, due to an ancient spell, the brothers'wightscontinued to dwell in the barrows, protecting these treasures.

Looting the Barrows is popular due to the potential of receiving valuable rewards, including the uniqueBarrows equipment, with increasingly valuable rewards for killing more monsters in the crypts, including theBarrows brothersthemselves.

In theminiquestHis Faithful Servantsplayers are tasked to slay all sixBarrows brothersand then loot the chest for thestrange icon. Completing the miniquest rewards some Prayer experience and the ability to use yourminimapwithin theBarrows tunnels.

History[edit|edit source]

TheBarrows brotherswere ancient warriors ofSaradominwho established a reputation of near invincibility while fighting in theGod Wars.

They launched a massive attack, known as theMorytania Campaign, to liberateMorytaniafrom the clutches ofLord Lowerniel Vergidiyad Drakanand hisvampyres. As the brothers departed, a mysterious stranger granted them superhuman power to battle Drakan's forces, by supplying them with the weapons and armour now known as theBarrows equipment. It succeeded, for the brothers, who were in the front line, seemed invincible. They had not anticipated, however, that the stranger had ulterior motives for helping them.

As the brothers and their accompanying army progressed further into enemy territory inMorytania, the stranger followed them until the brothers became weakened. The brothers were grievously wounded in battle near the Great Vyrewall, and thus the army set up camp just west ofMeiyerditch. Soon, the brothers died of their infected wounds simultaneously in the army's camp. The army quickly decided to retreat from Morytania, realising they could never succeed without their former leaders' prowess, but as a reflection of the brothers' bravery, they vowed to honour their martyred heroes as a final act before retreating.

The army spent six days and nights holding off the attacking vampyres to construct burial mounds, the Barrows, to honour the fallen brothers.

As the army began its return, the stranger slowly started walking towards the brothers, now dead and interred in their barrows. Arms outstretched atop the central mound, the stranger chanted in some foul, ancient language, casting his old magic. A vulgar purple light formed in front of him, fell to the earth, and bled into each of the barrows.

Not many of the original army made it back on the journey home, but tales were told of how each night an unnatural glow could be seen on the horizon where they had buried the brothers. Even today there are stories told about those mounds of earth, and of the sights and sounds that have been witnessed nearby.

Acrumbling tome, obtained by searching the hut near the mounds or by talking to theStrange Old Manfound digging the crypts, provides a detailed account of how the brothers came to be buried.
