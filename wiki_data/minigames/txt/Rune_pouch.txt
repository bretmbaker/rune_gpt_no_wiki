Therune pouchis an item that can store 16,000 of three types of runes (except runes found in theNightmare Zone). Players can cast spells using the runes stored in the pouch, so a rune pouch saves inventory space.  Using aneedle, the rune pouch can be upgraded to adivine rune pouchwith athread of Elidinisand level 75Crafting. Playerscannotown more than one rune pouch.

Arune pouch notecan be purchased from players, theGrand Exchange, or bought fromJustine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standingfor 75Last Man Standingpoints; this note can be exchanged for a rune pouch at anybank. It can also be purchased from aSlayer masterfor 750Slayer reward points.

Players can speak to themagic combat tutorinLumbridgeto toggle an option which allows runes to be placed directly into the rune pouch upon pickup and runecrafting, provided that there is a stack of that rune already in the pouch with enough space in it to hold all of them. Alternatively, this option can be toggled from theSettingsinterface.

Players can also make and load presets into the pouch by configuring it while in a bank interface. In this mode, players have four load-outs available to customise by both the types and quantities of runes for each preset. Runes withdrawn from the bank while the interface is open will be put into the pouch, if space is available.

If players die while carrying a rune pouch in the Wilderness or in aPvP world, theywill losethe rune pouch, unless it has been locked via use of atrouver parchment. It should be noted that the Trouver parchment does not protect runes stored within a Rune pouch upon death.
