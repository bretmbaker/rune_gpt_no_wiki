Tackle organised crimeis aminigamein which players help theShayziensoldiers raid gang meetings in order to keep order inGreat Kourend.

Players can find out where gang meetings are about to take place by talking toCaptain Gineain the tent just south-east of the bank chest, marked with themap icon.Every 30 minutes, the noticeboard will give out the location of a gang meeting. After reading the notice, players are prompted to takea noteto remind players of the location (activity can fully be done without the note).

Participating in a gang bust is advised when possible, as they are a good source foroak,teakandmahogany planks.

The location of the gang meeting follows a rotation shared by all servers. This means there is no point in world hopping to look for meetings.

Gang bosses and gangsters[edit|edit source]

In each meeting are multiplegangstersand agang boss. The number of gangsters that attend vary, ranging from 4-10 at a time. The weapons the gang members use vary from gang to gang; gangsters may use longswords, warhammers, halberds or their fists to attack the player. The gang bosses either use a cutlass or throwing knives. When a gangster or gang boss is attacked, all the gang members will turn aggressive towards the player. In single-way areas, gangsters will attempt to attack the player; if the player is in combat with another gang member, they will attack once the gang member they are fighting dies.

Five minutesafter the meeting begins, any remaining gang members will attempt to leave the area. Non-aggroed gangsters become un-attackable, and shortly disappear. Aggroed gangsters will remain in the area so long as one gangster is in active combat; immediately after all active skirmishes cease they will become un-targetable and disappear. This happens as soon as a gangster dies so it is impossible for lone players to drag a meeting into overtime. Wounded gangsters may die instead of disappearing, dropping their items. As there is a chance that wounded gangsters may die after 5 minutes, attacking the boss near the 5 minute mark is an easy way forcombat puresto get an intelligence drop without having to risk taking damage by fighting him normally.
