ThePaterdomus Templeis the temple markingMisthalin's eastern border. It acts as the gateway intoMorytaniaand is located in easternSilvareaon theRiver Salve. The priestDrezelis the owner of the temple, although it also plays host to some unwelcomeMonks of Zamorak, as discovered in thePriest in Perilquest.

History[edit|edit source]

Long ago, theSeven Priestly Warriorsheld back the forces ofLord Lowerniel Vergidiyad Drakanand sanctified theRiver Salve, thus preventing the hordes of Morytania from being able to cross over and invadeMisthalin. The Paterdomus Temple was then built on the site of this famous battle.

During the Priest in Peril quest, it is discovered that the temple has been taken over by Zamorakian monks, who are working on a method to take down the barrier on the Salve.
