TheChambers of Xericis araidlocated within a sprawling cave system beneathMount Quidamortemin theKebos Lowlands. It was the first raid introduced toOld School RuneScape.

Long ago,Xericand some of his followers travelled to the mountain after his exile from the kingdom ofGreat Kourend. The Chambers themselves and the now-ruined temple that sits above them were built by Xeric's personal artisan,Tekton. The experiments conducted within the Chambers resulted in, among many other things, the creation of theMuttadile, an attempted coup by Xeric'sHigh Priest(which resulted in Xeric ordering the destruction of the temple), and accidentally letting ina powerful Abyssal creature.

Even after Xeric took the power he sought within the Chambers, the caves still house the results of his many experiments, as well asthe Guardian in the DeepXeric himself fought against — and won.

Ironmenare eligible for rewards from the raid when completing it alongside other players.Group ironman playerswill lose theirprestigeupon entering the raid with a player outside of their group.

Location[edit|edit source]

The Chambers of Xeric are located onMount Quidamortem, which can be quickly accessed via theLovakengj Minecart Network. This costs 20coinsper ride unless the player has completedThe Forsaken Tower, in which case it is free.

Otherwise, players will need to head to theShayziens' Walland make their way west to Mount Quidamortem; be wary of aggressivelizardmenandlizardmen brutes. For those arriving there without the mine cart system, speak to theMountain Guide(who is located on the mountain next toGnosi,Historian Duffy, and theNatural Historian) before leaving; doing so will establish a two-way transportation system between the mountain and the Shayziens' Wall which can be accessed by using theBook of the deadand use theHistory and hearsayoption, then run south-west.

Once players receive anancient tabletas a reward from the Chambers of Xeric, they are able to use it onXeric's talismanto instantly teleport to the mountain.

Mechanics[edit|edit source]

The Chambers of Xeric uses a unique party finding system to help determine how strong the team is. The raid can be started with just one player or up to 100 at a time. Players in smaller groups can also scale the raid without having to rely on others to fill in the actual slots. The stats of the enemies in the raid will likewise scale accordingly to the team size, while the skill requirements are based on the team's overall skilling levels. Players can also toggle "large raids" if they choose to.

To start a raid, the leader must create a team. This "team" is the leader'schat-channel, which other players may join by manually typing in the channel's name. Additionally, the leader must register on the recruitment board. Once everyone is ready, the leader should enter the chambers, where a starting room is located. The raid officially starts once the leader starts the raid; when that happens, all the mechanics will be calculated and no one may join the instance if they were not in by the time the raid started. If the leader leaves by any means, the next leader will be whoever has the highest rank in the Clan Chat, with a minimum rank of recruit; if no suitable rank is found, everyone is thrown out of theinstance.

The entrance room contains a bank chest to allow players to adjust their inventories accordingly to whatever rooms are generated in the raid. Players will not be able to drop items before the raid starts, and the bank chest will be closed shut once the raid begins.

There are three floors in each raid: two floors of pre-combat/skilling rooms, and the third floor houses the final boss and is always static in every layout. Energy pools are found in scavenger rooms, resource rooms and the final room in the first two floors, which fully replenish run energy when interacted with.

In normal raids, a floor will consist of both a starting and exit room, one resource room, one or two scavenger rooms, and two or three combat and/or skilling rooms. In the event that two scavenger rooms are in a single floor, one of these will always use the large layout with a skilling obstacle inside it. These floors will either consist of seven or eight rooms.

If large raids are toggled, the floors will be entirely filled with eight rooms, and each floor will consist of both a starting and exit room, one resource room, one scavenger room, and four combat and/or skilling rooms. Duplicate skilling rooms are enabled in large raids, meaning that it is possible to get two tightrope rooms in the same raid.

Challenge Mode[edit|edit source]

Challenge Mode is a "hard" version of the existing Chambers of Xeric, which can be toggled on. All combat and puzzle rooms are featured in challenge mode, and all enemies' stats and health (barring the Great Olm, who only has increased stats) are increased. Unlike normal mode, the layout is always static, and with all puzzle and combat rooms being featured, players must clear through four floors of enemies rather than three.

Completion of the mode in a specific time frame can yieldmetamorphic dustto reskin anolmlet, andtwisted ancestral colour kitto recolour ancestral robes. Cosmetic capes are awarded at specific clear milestones.

Resources[edit|edit source]

The Chambers of Xeric have various resources which can be used in the raid to make things easier.

Scavenger beastscan be found around the dungeon. One scavenger room is always guaranteed somewhere in the raid, and it will always be before the first puzzle room. It is common to encounter one scavenger room on each floor, though in uncommon circumstances players may encounter two scavenger rooms on the floor. They are primarily killed for tool and Herblore secondary drops, which are used in the resource rooms, such asbutterfly netsandcave worms.

The scavengers encountered are random, in addition to the room type they appear in - some rooms may be a small bend or curve, others a spacious area (which will always contain aboulder, mining rock or sapling shortcut which can be cleared away for points). The amount of scavengers in the room, along with their strength (to a very mild degree) is determined by the amount of players in the raid.

If the player dies in the Chambers, they will dropallraid-only items upon death; for example, if the player died with 10 Xeric's aid (+), those potions are dropped immediately upon dying. Other items that can be found, such as a hammer, will not be dropped upon death.

Food[edit|edit source]

All thesecookingresources require the same level forhuntingorfishingthem, with the tier being determined by the team's overall Hunter/Fishing level. They are not often utilised in normal raids as Xeric's aid heals more per inventory space.

To catch bats, abutterfly netis required.

To catch fish, afishing rodis required, withcave wormsas bait. In fishing rooms, there are three fishing spots. One of these three spots contains acave snake, which will damage the player (or take their fish). If a snake appears in the fishing spot, stop fishing and click elsewhere to avoid taking damage. Only spots containing plain fish and cave snakes will move occasionally.

All the items required to capture bats and fish can be dropped by scavengers.

Food | Levels | XP | Heals

 | Pysk fish (0) | 11 | 2010 | 5

 | Suphi fish (1) | 1515 | 2313 | 8

 | Roqed fish (5) | 7575 | 3525 | 20

 | Kyren fish (6) | 9090 | 3828 | 23

In resource rooms without fishing spots, there will be two to three bats flying around in the chamber, which can be caught and cooked for food. Players with 99Huntercan catch any bats barehanded.

Farming[edit|edit source]

Seeds can be obtained from several bosses, such as theSkeletal mystics,Lizardmen shamans, andGuardian statues. They can also be found by rakingweedsin the top and lower floors (the last area in those floors and the first area in the lower floor).

There are two farming plots in each resource room for players to grow herbs. Due to the magic of the chambers, herbs grow faster and are fully grown in 30 seconds.

Seed | Level | Planting XP | Harvest XP

 | Golpar seed | 27 | 4 | 10

 | Buchu seed | 39 | 6 | 15

 | Noxifer seed | 55 | 12 | 30

Herblore[edit|edit source]

Potions can be dropped in small amounts by the bosses. Some bosses drop herblore secondaries, although they are primarily obtained from scavengers.

There are three types of potions a player can make:

Golpar (combat potions)Buchu (recovery potions)Noxifer (overload-type potions)

To create potions in the chambers, a gourd must be collected from the nearby gourd tree, then filled with water from the nearby water spout or withHumidify. Gourds can be picked en masse with the "Pick-lots" option. Gourds automatically break upon drinking the last dose of the potion.

Note:Potion tiers are capped on the player's Herblore level upon creation and will downgrade accordingly for overloads; e.g a player with 80 Herblore would be able to make combat+ potions, but as overload+ requires 90 Herblore, they will downgrade into a normal overload upon creation.

Storage units[edit|edit source]

Storage units are built frommallignum root planks, obtained as drops from scavengers. Ahammeris required in building storage units, with thedragon warhammerorelder maulbeing a suitable substitute.

Once a storage unit is built, anyone can use it. Storage units have a shared and personal inventory. The shared inventory allows players to store items used in the raid, such as the tools, seeds, herbs, Herblore secondaries, and potions. The personal inventory is much like the shared inventory, but it can also hold the player's belongings, such as weapons and armour. The player can also put in raid-unique items in there if desired. In addition to this, once a storage unit is built anywhere in the Chambers, they will appear in all potential hotspots where they may be found.

Storage units can be found at the end of each floor, in addition to appearing in resource rooms, the corrupted scavenger, ice demon chambers, and outside of theGreat Olmchamber.

While higher levelled storage units can be built immediately, they still require the materials to build the previous tiers. So in order to build a large storage unit instantly, you need 6 planks (4 for the first two storage units, then 2 for the remaining upgrade).

Players who leave the Chambers with their personal items still stored in the storage units can retrieve them from the private storage unit next to the bank chest on the mountain. The private storage unitmust be emptiedbefore players can re-enter the Chambers of Xeric. Should a player die outside of the Chambers of Xeric before claiming any items left in the chest, the items will not be destroyed. If the player is an Ultimate Iron Man, however, the items will instead be dropped outside of the entrance upon death.

Storage units | level | Planks required | Experience | Capacity | Capacity(personal)

 | Small storage unit | 30 | 2 | 150 | 250 | 30

 | Medium storage unit | 60 | 4 | 150 | 500 | 60

 | Large storage unit | 90 | 6 | 150 | 1,000 | 90

 | Massive storage unit | 99 | 8 | 150 | 1,500 | 120

Bosses[edit|edit source]

Bosses drop various items on defeat, apart from Great Olm. These drops are awarded to the player who dealt the most damage to them in the encounter. If this player should be an Ironman player, then the items can be picked up by all players.

Ice DemonLizardman ShamansMuttadilesSkeletal MysticsTektonVanguardsVasa NistirioVespulaGreat Olm(final boss)

Reward system[edit|edit source]

Player rewards are based on "participation" points. As the team collects more points, they have an increased chance of obtaining unique items. Individually, these points determine the quantity of common rewards. If a player dies in a raid, they will lose 40% of the points that they had before their death. If the player dies with none, or extremely few, personal points (less than 5% of the total points before death), the team's overall points are reduced instead by 5%.

Common loot awarded at the end of the raid scales up to 131,071 points. Additional points earned by a player after this point are still included when rolling for uniques.

If a member of a raid party leaves early, the points multiplier and difficulty for that raid will remain the same. To prevent megascale boosting abuse at Chambers of Xeric, players who leave a raid in progress are eligible to receive unique items, but if they would do so, the reward is discarded instead. This ensures that leaving a CoX raid no longer transfers loot chances onto remaining participants

Gaining Points[edit|edit source]

Gaining points in raids is possible in multiple ways, all of which have a cap which scales to the number of players in the raid. Below is a short description for all ways to gain points within the Chambers of Xeric.

Dealing damage within the Chambers of Xeric will reward the player with points based on damage dealt.

Building or upgrading thestorage unitwill give 100 points per tier.

In somescavengerrooms, a shortcut which requiresMining,Woodcutting, orStrengthto clear can be found. Clearing this shortcut rewards the player with points equal to the level requirement times 5. For example, for a shortcut that requires 86 mining, clearing the shortcut will result in 430 points.

In theMuttadileroom, there is ameat tree. Cutting this tree awards some points.

When a player steps between theGuardians, they will push the player away, dealing damage and awarding some points. The point cap for this is currently believed to scale non-linearly with the number of players in the raid[1]but the exact formula is not currently known.

A player is able to catch bats usingHunterand catch fish usingFishingwithin the Chambers of Xeric. When any player (including the person who cooked the food) eats them and heals damage, the player that cooked the food is awarded 4 + (8 * bat tier) points. If a different player to the one cooking the food uses that food to heal, the player that cooked the food receives 50% more points than if they were to eat it themselves.Psykk batsfound in the Thieving room count as food cooked by the player who found them. There is a cap on points gained from food equal to 20 times the number of people participating in the raid.

Appropriate use of potions that the player makes will award some points to the player that made them or got them from one of the bosses. The points awarded are capped at 5 sips times the number of people participating in the raid, plus five extra at a reduced amount. More points are given if a player other than the one who created the potion drinks them.
Overloads award the highest amount of points, so players should try to refrain from drinking other potions during the raid, as the point cap for potions is based on doses drunk, not points gained. 75 Herblore for overload, 90 Herblore for overload+.

In theJewelled Crabroom, attacking or being targeted by one of the crabs (including ones not used to bounce the floating crystal) will reward some points upon each successful crystal colour change.

When a player depositskindlingin thebraziersin theIce demonroom, they are rewarded with points.

When a player fills thetroughwithcavern grubsin theThievingroom, they are awarded with 115 points per grub.
The number of grubs required scales linearly based on the total thieving level of players participating in the raid.[2]

The minimum number of grubs required to complete the room is equal to 16 times the number of players in the raid, or 30 in a solo raid.

Note that this is different to the number of grubs that will grant points. The formula to get the total grubs that will grant points is as follows:

Max Points=max(4500,⌊totalThievingLevel/6⌋*150)Max Grubs=⌈maxPoints/115⌉

When a player uses thekeystone crystalon thebarrierin thetightroperoom, some points are awarded.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Depending on the points obtained in the raid, players have a chance to obtain a reward from theAncient Chestvia the unique drop table. If the player does not roll into the unique drop table, they will obtain two rolls of standard loot instead (both a different loot), with their quantity depending on points obtained.

Regardless of whether a unique drop was obtained, players may always additionally obtain thedark journalif they do not have it already, and themetamorphic dust/twisted ancestral colour kitfor players completing achallenge moderaid if successfully rolled on.

The beam of light above the chest will vary for the player depending on the loot obtained: by default, the light is white; if the player obtained an item from the unique drop table, it is purple; if the player obtained a metamorphic dust, it is turquoise; if the player obtained a twisted ancestral colour kit, it is green. If multiple such drops are obtained simultaneously, the light alternates between each appropriate colour.

Players can find books during the raid.

Forgotten prayers[edit|edit source]

Initially, six prayers were proposed to be unlocked via a single tradeable scroll obtained as a reward. The scroll will prompt players to choose which prayer to learn, after which it would crumble to dust.

Level | Prayer | Effect

55 | Preserve | Boosted stats last 20% longer.

65 | Poison Absorb | Poisondamage that would have been dealt to the player drains prayer points instead.

74 | Rigour | Boosts Ranged attack by 20%, Ranged strength by 23% and Defence by 25%.

75 | Divine Grace | When running, prayer points are drained instead ofrun energy.

77 | Augury | Boosts Magic accuracy and defence by 25%.

85 | Venom Absorb | Venomdamage that would have been dealt to the player drains prayer points instead.

In the third rewards blog, the requirements for Rigour and Augury were swapped, and a level 70 Defence requirement was added to both prayers.

In the fourth blog, the Divine Grace, Poison Absorb, and Venom Absorb prayers were scrapped.

High-tier armour[edit|edit source]

The Kodai robes, elder armour, and twisted armours were first proposed in the fourth rewards blog, and was polled inOld School Content Poll 47: Rewards for Raids & Slayer, failing the poll by 2.6% of the required votes to pass.

It was repolled inOld School Content Poll 48: Rewards for Raids & Quality of Lifea month later to emphasise that the set degrades with a 100,000 repair cost for each hour of usage. This failed the poll by 10.2% of the required votes to pass.

In order to assess what changes should be made to the armours to have it pass a poll, a new poll,Old School Raids Armours Surveywas made available. After feedback, the final rewards blog proposed adjusted stats, and the final rewards poll,More Raids Rewards, split each armour set into its own question. All three armour sets failed by around 4%.

First proposed in the first rewards blog, the robes required level 75 Magic & Defence to equip, and were proposed to be "slightly more powerful than Ahrim's robes" and undegradeable.

On the release of the second blog, the requirement to wear them was changed to level 75 Magic & Prayer, and their stats changed, as there were concerns of the price impact on Ahrim's robes.

With the release of the fourth rewards blog alongside elder and twisted armour, the Kodai robes were reworked entirely, again requiring level 75 Magic & Defence to equip, and being given increased bonuses. As a tradeoff, they degrade and become unusable after 10 hours of continuous usage in combat.

After having failed a poll twice, the final rewards blog did not adjust the Kodai robe's stats; rather, it proposed a second set of magic robes, the ancestral robes, which placed emphasis onmagic damage. The ancestral robes passed the final reward poll, while Kodai robes did not.

A top-tier set of melee armour requiring level 75 Defence to equip, the set will degrade and become unusable after 10 hours of continuous usage in combat.

Following player concerns on the impact elder armour will have on the price ofBandos armour, the strength bonus was reduced to match them, alongside a slight increase to the elder armour's magic defence:
