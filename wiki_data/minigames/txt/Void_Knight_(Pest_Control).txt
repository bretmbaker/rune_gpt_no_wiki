TheVoid Knightis found at the centre of the island during the minigamePest Control. The knight has 200hitpointsand will be attacked byDefilers,ShiftersandTorchers. If the knight dies, the minigame round will be lost, therefore the knight must be protected while the player destroys the fourportals. The only way to heal the knight is by destroying the portals, each of which will restore up to 50 hitpoints.

The knight that must be defended is randomly selected at the start of every game of Pest Control.
