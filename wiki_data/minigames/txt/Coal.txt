Coal can also be "purchased" by running yourkingdom. Kingdom effective GP/resource rates can be difficult to determine because you have to "buy" multiple resources at the same time, but assuming 5 workers are put on coal, the maximum value of75,000is deducted from the treasury each day, and the50,000invested in other resources breaks even, the kingdom returns 273 coal per day at a cost of25,000, or 91.6 GP/coal.
