[Minigame: Imbuing]

Imbuingis the process of upgrading or enhancing certain items. Most imbues are rewards fromNightmare Zone, whilst others are imbued by other means.

Nightmare Zone imbues[edit|edit source]

Points earned in Nightmare Zone can be spent in the reward shop toimbuecertain items. Imbuing an item provides extra bonuses and appends an (i) to the item name. Imbued items can be uncharged, which removes their bonuses and refunds 100% of the reward points it would cost to imbue the base item. Completing theHard Combat Achievementstier reduces the cost of imbuing all items by 50%.
Note that after claiming the rewards for the Hard Combat Achievements, the refunded points will be calculated over the current cost of imbuing an item, even if an item was imbued before completing the Hard Combat Achievements.

In order to get the "free" NMZ points, it is critical that you uncharge all imbued itemsbeforegoing toGhommalto claim the rewards (you can however cross the point threshold for Hard Combat Achievements before). Once you claim the rewards, the 50% cost reduction is applied and then you should reimbue all the items.
Uncharging all items returns 7,825,000 points of which 3,912,500 (utilizing the reduced cost perk of the Hard Combat Achievements) must be spent to reimbue all items. This nets you 3,912,500 points, or 50% of the original points spent. Spending these points on Herb boxes would yield 411 boxes for a value of5,014,842.19.

As the number of refunded points is based on your current Combat Achievements rewards, this process can be repeated if your number of Combat Achievement points drops out of the Hard rewards due to new Easy, Medium, or Hard Combat Achievement tasks being released. Even in this case the number of points refunded doesn't decrease until again claiming the Hard Combat Achievement rewards from Ghommal.

Soul Wars imbues[edit|edit source]

Imbues from theNightmare Zoneare also available atSoul Wars. However, players who imbued their items at the Nightmare Zone cannot un-imbue their items for Zeal Tokens.

Imbuing an item provides extra bonuses and appends an(i)suffix to the item's name. Imbued items can be uncharged, which removes the bonuses from the item and refunds the reward points used to imbue it.

Emir's Arena imbues[edit|edit source]

AScroll of imbuingcan be purchased from theEmir's Arenareward shop for 200 points. It is used to imbue items similar to theNightmare ZoneandSoul Wars Reward Shop. Items that have been imbued with the scroll can beunchargedto return the scroll to the player, allowing imbues to be swapped to other items freely. Since combat within Emir's Arena does not grant experience, players can imbue their items without gaining combat experience. Players that have already imbued items with NMZ points or Soul Wars Zeal Tokens can un-imbue them and get 100% of the points/tokens back, then re-imbue their items with a Scroll of imbuing.
