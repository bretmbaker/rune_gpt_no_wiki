[Minigame: Impling]

ImplingsareHuntercreatures that are featured in theminigameImpetuous Impulses. They are mainly found inPuro-Puro, but they can be found commonly acrossGielinor. Higher level requirement implings typically have more valuable loot.

Players must wield abutterfly netormagic butterfly netto be able tocatchimplings, but doing so with an emptyimpling jarin their inventory allows players to keep them (either to open later or sell at theGrand Exchange). Players can also catch implings barehanded, but this requires 10 Hunter levels above the requirement for catching that impling (for example,ninja implingsbarehanded requires level 84 Hunter instead of the normal 74). Implings caught without an impling jar will be looted immediately. An impling jar isrequiredto catch implings inPuro-Puro. However, if you have a jar in your inventory, you can barehand the impling into the jar. Grabbing an impling with your bare hands has the same success rate as attempting to catch one with a magic butterfly net.[1]

Three empty impling jars can be acquired fromElnock Inquisitorin Puro-Puro for any type of jarred impling. This can be a good use for young and baby implings, given their low value loot. They can also be generated with ajar generator(33 jars from a generator, one at a time).

Implings have the ability to fly over any body of water or lava, but not over obstacles that can be labelled with a line on theminimap. They can occasionally teleport to a nearby area which can cause complications when inside some thick walls, for example the wall east ofTaverley. This can make them impossible to catch and can only be fixed if the impling either teleports out or despawns.

Awandering implingroams around the large wheat field inZanaris. He cannot be caught, but he introduces players to theImpetuous Impulsesminigame in an eccentric manner and will show players the location of the two other portals outside of Puro-Puro. Another visually identical impling,Immenizz, can be found near the centre of Puro-Puro. He will explain briefly why implings might be hiding what humans may want.Fairy Aerykais found near the wandering impling, and she will also give her version of what implings are, and what is in Puro-Puro.

Unlike most other hunter creatures, players can use the spellsBind,Snare, andEntangleto keep an impling from moving further away, as well asDark Lureto force them to approach the player. This can be useful when in Puro-Puro, or to keep an impling from flying over a body of water. After tagging an impling successfully with a Binding spell, players have a few seconds of grace during which other players cannot attempt to catch the tagged impling.

Tracker[edit|edit source]

Players can right-click theirbutterfly netormagic butterfly netto open the impling tracker interface, which tracks how many implings they have caught inside Puro-Puro and on the surface world. It contains two tabs, one for implings caught on the surface world, and one for implings caught inPuro-Puro.

Implings that are caught barehanded are also tracked on this log. The tracker will still work without a butterfly net in the player's inventory or bank.

Spawn mechanics[edit|edit source]

Implings have a variety of methods in which they spawn. In most cases, they initially spawn as an invisible NPC, and "roam" invisibly for between one and three minutes, during which they can move a considerable distance from their spawn point; implings can even roam over obstacles, such as bodies of water andmagical wheat, a unique ability among NPCs.

Once implings become visible, a high-pitched "beckon whistle" sound plays with a subtle rattling. They will roam for approximately thirty minutes before disappearing. Implings will typically stay within a radius of a hundred tiles from their spawn point.[2]

Types of spawn[edit|edit source]

There are four types of invisible spawns for implings: low-tier, mid-tier, high-tier, and another high-tier exclusive toPuro-Puro. These tiers determine the type of impling that appears in place of the invisible NPC, in which the chances of one spawning are as follows:

Impling | Chance

 | Baby impling | 20/100

 | Young impling | 20/100

 | Gourmet impling | 20/100

 | Earth impling | 20/100

 | Essence impling | 10/100

 | Magpie impling | 114/301

 | Ninja impling | 27/301

 | Dragon impling | 9/301

 | Lucky impling | 1/301

Gielinor[edit|edit source]

On Gielinor (the overworld), there are 53 spawn points. Among them, there are 42 that will spawn all types of implings; this occurs every thirty minutes from when theserverboots up (usually Wednesday, ~11:30 UTC). This spawn timer is based on serverticksrather than time in real life.

Each thirty-minute cycle, the game will roll to determine which invisible NPCs will spawn, which consequently determines which implings will spawn. For each spawn point, the following table is likely rolled three times, resulting in between zero and three invisible NPC's spawning at that location:

Low-tier spawn: 14/100Mid-tier spawn: 7/100High-tier spawn: 4/100Nothing: 75/100

The known spawn points of this type are as follows:

The other 10 spawn points will always spawn an impling from the low-tier table, plus one within theZanarismarketplace. Upon capture, the invisible NPC will respawn immediately and once again roam for around two minutes before becoming visible and determining the type of impling to spawn.

Puro-Puro[edit|edit source]

OnPuro-Puro(the realm where theImpetuous Impulsesminigame takes place), there are 35 spawn points that produce an invisible NPC which roams for two minutes before manifesting, and respawn immediately upon capture. Of these 35 spawn points, there are 21 low-tier spawns, 12 mid-tier spawns, and 2 high-tier spawns:

In addition, there are 51 fixed spawns of specific low-tier implings found throughout Puro-Puro. These spawn directly as implings rather than first spending a brief time invisible, and have a set respawn time of 50 ticks for the earth and essence implings, and of 7 ticks for all other varieties:

Force-spawning[edit|edit source]

The best method to find the rarest and most valuable implings is to force-spawn them.

In Puro-Puro, higher tier implings (nature implingsand above) can be found much more commonly than on Gielinor. This is because, as seen above, Puro-Puro has two specific points which only spawn high-tier implings.

As an example, to maximise the amount ofdragon implingsspawning, a player will want to catch all rare implings (nature,magpie,ninja) as these will have spawned from the higher tier spawn tiles, giving them a chance for a dragon impling to spawn. This is best done at either the north-west or south-east corners of Puro-Puro, and it is advised to hop between multiple worlds because of the 2 minute "respawn"-timer for these higher tier implings.
