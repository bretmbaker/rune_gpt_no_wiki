TheSorceress's Gardenis aThieving/Farmingminigamelocated inAl Kharidwhich may be accessed after the completion ofPrince Ali Rescue. In it, players attempt to sneak past guards in order to stealsq'irkfruit to makesq'irkjuice, orherbsfrom the garden.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

Members can use anamulet of gloryto teleport inside the palace, on theground floor[UK]1stfloor[US]in the southern room. This brings you close to bothOsmanand the mini-game, as well as a bank.Membersthat have completedThe Grand Treequest can use thegnome gliderto travel to and from Al Kharid.FromLumbridge, use the toll gate which costs either 10coins, or if you have completed thePrince Ali Rescuequest, the gate is free.Members can use aring of duelingtoteleportto theEmir's Arena, just north-east of Al Kharid.

Introduction[edit|edit source]

If you talk toOsmanafter completing thePrince Ali Rescuequest (orSelimafter completingBeneath Cursed Sands), you will find out that he wants to getsq'irkjuice, but the sorceress with whom he normally deals now refuses to give it to him. To this end, he will enlist you to stealsq'irkfruit from her garden. You can get to the garden from theapprenticewho works in the house near theShantay Pass. After following below steps once, you can immediately right-click Teleport at the Apprentice the next time.

Step-by-step:

The gardens[edit|edit source]

The garden is divided into five areas. You appear in the central garden with a fountain andDel-Montythe cat. Drinking from thefountainwill teleport you back to the Sorceress's house. Del-Monty will tell you about the garden and the minigame if you speak to him while wearing acatspeak amuletor have completedDragon Slayer IIto the point of being enchanted (after which the player can speak to cats without the amulet).

Surrounding the central garden are four seasonal gardens, each of which has aSq'irk tree:

The Winter garden has a tree with withered fruits.The Spring garden has a tree with nearly-ripe fruits.The Autumn garden has a tree with over-ripe fruits.The Summer garden has a tree with perfectly ripe fruits.

You can only enter a seasonal garden if your currentThievinglevel matches or exceeds the garden's required level. Fruits gained from a garden can be crushed into an emptybeer glassusing apestle and mortarto makesq'irkjuice. Beer glasses needed for this minigame can be obtained for free by searching the shelves in the Sorceress's house.

Level | Season | Sq'irk fruit | Sq'irk juice | # of sq'irks | Thieving boost | Run energyrecovery | Experience fromOsman | Experience per fruit

N/A | Winter |  |  | 5 | 0 | 5% | 350 | 70

25 | Spring |  |  | 4 | 1 | 10% | 1,350 | 337.5

45 | Autumn |  |  | 3 | 2 | 15% | 2,350 | 783.3

65 | Summer |  |  | 2 | 3 | 20% | 3,000 | 1,500

You can only pick one fruit per trip, or if you pickherbsinstead, you will always get two clean herbs at once before you are teleported out of the garden. The types of herbs will vary, but picking them will always yield 50Farmingexperience, or 25 experience per herb, regardless of which garden is chosen. You may enter the seasonal gardens again for more resources. Crushing sq'irks always gives 5Cookingexperience, regardless of the season.

To leave the garden, simply drink from the fountain located in the central garden. Alternatively, use anamulet of gloryorring of duelingto teleport toAl Kharid, which gets you close toOsmanto hand him the sq'irkjuice.

Walkthrough[edit|edit source]

Getting through a garden is much easier withruntoggled on.Low weightand a decentAgilitylevel helps significantly extend the length of time you can run. Wearweight-reducing gearand usestaminaorsuper energypotions if possible. Main articles linked below include strategies and recommended inventory setup.

Mass worlds[edit|edit source]

Doing Sorceress's Garden in masses is not popular anymore so it is usually not possible to find a world where there are enough players to do this.

In worlds with many players running at the same time, the chance that any one player is individually caught is very low, which allows them to almost always reach the sq'irk tree with minimal clicks and attention. This strategy works on any of the four gardens, however it requires very large amounts of players to work. As such, the lower level gardens will generally only work during peak times, with the summer garden being populated enough more often.

Compared with theOne-click Summer Garden Method, mass worlds offer the benefit of not requiring the complex set-up, but its viability depends on having a very large number of fellow thieves running together. To execute this method, you must find a world in which there are a lot of players, this can be difficult as there are no official worlds for the activity. When inside the garden, click on the tree. Due to the large amount of players, you will normally not get caught.

In some cases, it appears that the same player is targeted multiple times by the elemental and teleported out of the game. The elementals target players based on a poorly understood order of priority comparable toPID. If you find yourself being targeted by the elementals in the mass world method, using a VPN, a different network or resetting your router will usually offer a solution.

Tips and equipment[edit|edit source]

The ideal inventory setup has just enough empty inventory slots to hold the required amount of sq'irk for making the juice, one pestle and mortar, optional potions/boosters and the remaining space as beer glasses.Beer glassescan be made using theCraftingskill or obtained by searching the shelves in the house that theapprenticeand Aadeela the Sorceress are in.It is possible to get into the gardens by usingThievingboosts, such as those from the juices themselves.The elementals can only 'see' and teleport the player when there are two or fewer squares between them and the player.
