TokKulis the currency ofMor Ul Rek. It is made from obsidian and cannot be created by players. As it is a currency, TokKul dropped by monsters can be automatically collected if the player is wearing aring of wealth.

TokKul is made out of the corpses of the TzHaar, as stated in the 17thPostbag from the Hedgeletter. When asked why players cannot trade TokKul,TzHaar-Hur-Lekresponded:

“ | TokKul is precious to us; why want you to trade it to someone else? Do you not know that TokKul is most sacred? We TzHaar age and harden, and when death takes us naturally we are then solid, unchanging obsidian. The ancients among us are then made into TokKul to ensure that they remain cared for by their descendents.JalYt-Ket: you would trade the bodies of your ancestors? We do not wish for TokKul to be traded by hands unwatched by TzHaar. | ”

Obtaining TokKul[edit|edit source]

There are currently eight ways to get TokKul:

TheTzHaar Fight Pitminigame, along with selling to the TzHaar shops, was the first way to get TokKul.TheTzHaar Fight Caveis a gauntlet for players proving themselves worthy of afire cape. Players obtain variable TokKul as a consolation prize depending on how far they progress before succumbing. The amount of TokKul received from the Fight Cave is doubled after completing the elite tasks in theKaramja Diary. However, this diary requires already owning a fire cape.TheInfernois another minigame similar to the TzHaar Fight Cave where players can receive TokKul.TzHaar-Ket-Rak's Challengesaward TokKul depending on how many jads you kill. Note: you always get TokKul regardless of how far you get. It is not a percent chance like other currency rewards throughout the game.With 90Thieving, players can pickpocketTzHaar-Hur. A successful pickpocket can render between 3-10 TokKul, or various gems up to diamond. While it's not a requirement to be wearingice gloveswhile pickpocketing, it is suggested for them to be equipped in order to reduce the damage taken from the TzHaar-Hur.If a player has 80Fishing, they can fish forinfernal eels. When caught, they must be smashed open with aHammerin order to receive a small amount of TokKul,lava scale shards, oronyx bolt tips.Selling runes is a way to get quick TokKul. It is most effective to sell runes atTzHaar-Mej-Roh's Rune Store, as well asTzhaar-ket-omsatTzHaar-Hur-Tel's Equipment Storeoruncut gemsatTzHaar-Hur-Lek's Ore and Gem Store. Sellingchaos runesis a popular method for Ironmen, because even at low levels they can be acquired in large quantities by buying them from rune stores, runecrafting, drops from monsters, or throughBarrowswith thehard morytania diarycompleted.  The TzHaar stores buy back items for approximately 10-20% of thestore selling price. Due to the limited usefulness of some of the Tzhaar weapons (maul, knives, sword) the prices of these items are determined by the price of theonyxgemstone.It is recommended to wearKaramja gloves 1or higher while selling items to TzHaar shops, as this increases the amount of TokKul received.Four TzHaar monsters can be killed around Mor Ul Rek to obtain TokKul:TzHaar-KetTzHaar-XilTzHaar-MejTzHaar-Hur
