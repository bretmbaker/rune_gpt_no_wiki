TheRaging Echoes Leaguewas the fifth and most recentLeagueinOld School Runescape. The League was announced during theSummer Summit 2024and began on 27 November 2024, lasting 8 weeks, ending on 22 January 2025.

The League carried forward the region-locking mechanic ofTrailblazer LeagueandTrailblazer Reloaded Leaguewith the additional option of Varlamore, and new content such as Echo Bosses.

Overview

The Raging Echoes League was a temporary game mode with a unique ruleset that fundamentally changed the gameplay experience. Players began with most regions of the game locked and were able to unlock new ones by completing tasks and accumulatingleague points. At certain point thresholds, players were able to select powerful relics that affect skilling, combat, or provide extra utility. Raging Echoes followed the format of the previousTrailblazerandTrailblazer Reloadedleagues, but added new features such as combat masteries and more difficult boss versions called echo bosses. Players could view their progress and accomplishments by viewing theirsummary interfacein their settings.

Combat Masteries

Combat masteries were a new system to Raging Echoes League that offered boosts to combat. Masteries were a separate progression system to relics, offering players new choices and permanent decisions to further increase power.

The Combat Masteries were split into three styles:Melee,Ranged, andMagic, each with 6 Masteries. Each Combat Mastery in a style required the previous tier of that style to be unlocked. The first time the player reached a tier of Combat Mastery in any style also enabled an additional passive bonus that applied to all styles of combat.

Relics

Relicsare powerful buffs which are unlocked withLeague Points. Relics offer bonuses that boost actions related to gathering, processing, teleportation, and combat. Upon completing the league tutorial, players are presented with the choice of their first relic between three. Additional relics can be unlocked as players reach certain point thresholds and unlock new tiers.

Once players choose a Relic of a tier, they will be permanently unlocked, but cannot change their relic selection for that tier.
