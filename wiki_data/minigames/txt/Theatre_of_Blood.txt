Map



TheTheatre of Bloodis araidlocated beneath the castle ofVer Sinhaza. It is a large arena used by the rulingvampyresto host blood sports. The only hard requirement to participate in the raid is the completion of thePriest in Perilquest to be able to accessMorytania. The raid is featured prominently in the questA Night at the Theatre.

Here, the citizens ofMeiyerditchare encouraged to go to the theatre and fight against the various experiments and abominations contained within, with the promise of freedom from theblood tithesand the right to leaveMorytaniashould they succeed. The reward is revealed to be a ruse as the vampyres are unwilling to let go of their primary food source.

While the theatre is only open to citizens ofMeiyerditch, this rule is rarely enforced. The vampyres are more entertained by outsiders than the citizens themselves, seeing as these are better prepared compared to the civilians who are inexperienced and poorly equipped.

Ironmenare eligible for rewards from the raid when completing it alongside other players.Group ironman playerswill lose theirprestigeupon entering the raid with a player outside of their group.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

Drakan's medallionprovides unlimited teleports directly to Ver Sinhaza. The medallion is locked behind the completion ofA Taste of Hopequest.Players may pay 10,000 coins toAndrasnorth of theEctofuntusinPort Phasmatysto travel toSlepe, then run south from there. Players can also use anEctophialto travel to theEctofuntusand run south from there.After startingDarkness of Hallowvale, players can take the boat fromBurgh de Rottto theMeiyerditchbeach and walk to the Theatre without having to navigate through the city.

Official worlds[edit|edit source]

The followingofficial worldsare assigned to the Theatre of Blood:

World | Location | Members | Activity

Mechanics[edit|edit source]

Bosses[edit|edit source]

 | Wave complete

The jingle that plays once a boss has been defeated.



The Theatre of Blood is a linear raid. Thus, there is no randomization involved, and the bosses will always be encountered in this order.

The Maiden of Sugadinti(level-940)Pestilent Bloat(level-870)Nylocas Vasilias(level-800)Sotetseg(level-995)Xarpus(level-960)Verzik Vitur(level-1040, final boss)

Despite some of the bosses being spiders, vampyres and dark beasts, theywill notcount towards aSlayer taskwhen killed inside the Theatre; thus, theslayer helmetandblack maskbonuses have no effect.

The bosses will also have their hitpoints scaled depending on the team size. With a team of three or fewer players the bosses will have 75% of their original hitpoints, with four players the bosses will have 87.5% of their original hitpoints and a team of five players will leave the bosses' hitpoints unchanged.

A group of players fighting Serafina, the Maiden of Sugadinti.A group of players fighting The Butcher's crazed creation, the Pestilent Bloat.A group of players fighting the Nylocas Vasilias, a result of Verzik Vitur's diverse breeding program.A group of players battle against Sotetseg, adark beastcorrupted throughHaemalchemyand experiments in theShadow Realm.A group of players fighting Xarpus, the last of the Yarasa race and its king.A group of players fighting Verzik Vitur, a powerfulvampyrenoble.

Death within the Theatre[edit|edit source]

If players die within the theatre, they are placed outside the fighting area, and can only proceed if other team members succeed in completing the current challenge. If the entire team is killed, players will lose all unprotected items; these can later be reclaimed from a storage chest (similar toTorfinn's item storage) for a cost of 100,000 coins. Untradeable items that are normally kept on death will be placed in the item reclamation chest upon complete team death in the theatre.

If players die a second time without reclaiming the items in the chest, they will be permanently lost, unless the death occurs within a minigame deemed safe, such asPest Control.

Dying in the Theatre of Blood is a dangerous death -Hardcore Ironmenwho die within the theatre will lose their Hardcore status, regardless of whether the team successfully completes the challenges or not. Any disconnection or logout during a fight is treated as a death, and will likewise result in loss of Hardcore status. Should a player logout when not in an encounter, such as in the hallways of the theatre, the player's death will be treated as a safe death. Upon logging back in to an unsafe death, the game will attempt to reunite the player with their party and, if successful, will place the player in purgatory. If unsuccessful, the player will be treated with a full death and will have to pay the item reclamation fee to retrieve any items lost.

All normal forms of teleportation within the Theatre are blocked; however, theMysterious Strangeroutside sellsescape crystalsfor 75,000 coins each, and is the only item players can use to teleport away from the Theatre safely.

Spectating[edit|edit source]

Players can spectate other teams in the Theatre of Blood by attempting to enter the theatre, or by speaking toAbigaila, aMorytanianrefugee who can be found upstairs in theLumbridge General Storeor near thespirit treenorth-east of theGrand Exchange.

Players can either choose to spectate a specific player's team by typing in a team member's or a spectator's name, or choose to spectate the most recently formed party. Spectators must be on the same world as the party member or spectator they wish to spectate. Spectators must also be on theFriends Listof the party member or spectator, should the party member or spectator have Private Chat set to "Friends Only."

In order to spectate, players cannot bring any items with them, excluding theoculus orb, and they must not bepoisonedordiseased.

As ofan updateon21 June2018, players can right-click the ledges to view the fight in a better perspective. Players can rotate the camera clock-wise or counter-clockwise via the chatbox.

Other modes[edit|edit source]

Entry Mode[edit|edit source]

An easy variant of the Theatre of Blood intended for beginners to warm themselves up and gain experience before attempting the Theatre in Normal Mode. All of the enemies are significantly weaker compared to normal mode, with several mechanics adjusted to be less dangerous.

Similarly to the Chambers of Xeric andTombs of Amascut(without death-changing invocations), players have unlimited attempts at the bosses.Bandagesare provided for the team after clearing the second and fourth bosses, along with any wipes.

Raids completed in entry mode award 80% less loot compared to normal mode, and uniques cannot be rolled, including theLil' zikpet.

Hard Mode[edit|edit source]

A hard variant of the Theatre of Blood is also available for players up to the challenge. Similarly to the Chambers of Xeric "Challenge Mode", all enemies in the Theatre of Blood are significantly stronger, with new and modified mechanics added to all bosses. Completion of Hard Mode can yieldSanguine dustto reskinLil' Zik, and theHolyandSanguine ornament kitsto recolour thesanguinesti staff,ghrazi rapierandscythe of vitur, with the latter kit only working for the scythe.

Teams are also awarded with 15% more common drops when received (with an additional 15% if the raid is completed within the challenge time), along with a 13% chance of obtaining unique items (compared to the standard 11%).[1]The weighting of items are adjusted in hard mode, with theavernic defender hiltbeing less likely to be rolled compared to other items.

In order to access Hard Mode, players must have completed a full run of the Theatre in normal mode.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

Upon defeating Verzik Vitur, a trapdoor will open under her throne, leading to her treasure vault.

Inside will be up to five large chests based on the amount of players in the team, with each player being able to loot one chest. An arrow will point to which chest is for that player to search.

If a unique reward is obtained, a purple aura will emit from the chest, much like how the ray of light turns purple for the player who obtains a unique reward in theChambers of Xeric. If no unique reward is found, the chest will contain three rolls from the common drop table. Of the unique rewards that players can obtain from the chest include:

Avernic defender hilt, used to upgrade thedragon defenderPieces of theJusticiar armour:Justiciar faceguardJusticiar chestguardJusticiar legguardsGhrazi rapierSanguinesti staffScythe of vitur
