Players may read the Tears of Guthix entry in theirQuest Journalto find out how many days and how many quest points or experience points are needed before being allowed to play the minigame again. Players can speak to Juna to toggle whether or not to receive a chatbox message telling them they are eligible as soon as they become eligible.

Playing the game[edit|edit source]

 | Collecting blue tears





 | Collecting green tears





Warning:Due to Tears of Guthix rewarding experience in the player's lowest skill, it is advised thatcombatandskill puresdo not play this minigame.

Upon tellingJunaa story, she will give the player a bowl which requires two free hands to wield, and allow them into the minigame area. While inside, the player must collect as many blue tears flowing from theweeping wallsas they can within the time limit, while avoiding the green streams that decrease the number of blue tears collected. The player will automatically leave the area once their time is up.

There are a total of 9 weeping walls within the area, with 3 blue and 3 green streams being active at all times. Each stream of tears will remain in place for 16game ticks(9.6 seconds) before moving again. The streams will always move in sequence one after another, with eachworldhaving its own sequence. Knowing the sequence of colours can make it easier for players to predict where they should move next, which can save time.

The player's time limit depends on the number of quest points they have: the morequest pointsthey have, the longer their time limit will be and thus the more potential tears they can collect. The player is granted one game tick (0.6 seconds) of time inside of the cave for every quest point obtained: with 321 quest points, a theoretical maximum of 317 tears (19020 experience) is possible, however due to the way the minigame functions, a realistic maximum would be closer to 264 (15840 experience).

Strategy[edit|edit source]

There are a few things a player can do to maximise their points potential:

Find a world where the order the streams refresh is Green, Green, Green, Blue, Blue, Blue (GGGBBB). This makes it impossible for a player to accidentally collect green tears once their blue stream has ended as all the green streams would have relocated to a different empty space before the blue streams expire. The rest of these tips will assume the player is using a GGGBBB world.Complete Juna's dialogue (to gain entry) when the first green stream is approximately half way through its duration. This will allow them to enter just as the first blue stream refreshes.Initially using the first blue stream to refresh will give the player the highest chance of being able to stay in the same spot as there will be a 5/9 (56%) chance of one of the other blue streams relocating to the player's current spot.If the player's current spot refreshes, they should note whether it is the 2nd or 3rd stream in the cycle:If it is the 2nd, they have a 1/3 chance for their spot to refresh for a 3rd time allowing them to stay in the same spot for a total of 48 game ticks (28.8 seconds).If it is the 3rd, they should move back to the first blue stream as soon as their current stream ends as there is no chance that a stream will refresh in their current spot.When there is less than one cycle (16 ticks) remaining before their time is up, and their stream ends, the player should prioritise moving to the closest blue stream rather than the first one since they won't have time to get a back to back stream anyway and moving less will save ticks.

It is also possible to try again if you leave through death, before experience is received at the end of the allotted time.

Reward[edit|edit source]

 | Drinking tears





When the time limit is up, the player will exit the minigame and drink the tears they have collected, granting experience in their lowest skill based on the number of tears collected. The amount of experience per tear increases as the player's level increases. This is 10 experience per tear if their lowest level is 1, or 26.6 experience per tear if their lowest level is 20, capping at 60 experience per tear at level 30. Players will get 10% additional experience if they have completed thehard Lumbridge & Draynor Diary.

If the player has multiple skills at the same level, the reward will go to the skill with the least experience. If any skills share the same amount of experience, the first eligible skill in the following list will be given the experience: Cooking, Crafting, Firemaking, Fishing, Magic, Mining, Prayer, Ranged, Runecrafting, Smithing, Woodcutting, Agility, Herblore, Fletching, Thieving, Slayer, Attack, Defence, Strength, Hitpoints, Farming, Construction, and Hunter.[1]

Experience earned from Tears of Guthix will not go towards theConstruction,Herblore, orRunecraftskills until the player gains access to the skills by buying a house from anestate agent, completing theDruidic Ritualquest, or completing theRune Mysteriesquest, respectively.
