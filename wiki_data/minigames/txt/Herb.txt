[Minigame: Herb]

Herbsare items used to makepotionswith theHerbloreskill. There are many herbs, each of which have a "clean" and "grimy" state. Herbs must be clean to be used in potions. Players can clean grimy herbs, provided that they have the minimum required Herblore level (see below).

When making potions, players must combine a clean herb with avial of water,coconut milk,vial of bloodor potentially other finishedpotionsbefore adding asecondary ingredientif necessary. The majority of herbs can be used to make more than one type of potion, the exceptions beingguam leaf,marrentill,rogue's purse, andsnapdragon.

Cleaning grimy herbs[edit|edit source]

Players will obtain all herbs as grimy throughFarming, though they can be obtained clean from other players, at theGrand Exchangeor through various monster drops. Players can clean grimy herbs by left-clicking on them,  gaining a small amount ofHerbloreexperiencepoints. Alternatively players can castDegrimeresulting in half the xp. Each type of herb has a minimumHerblorelevel requirement that players must have to do so. Players who do not have the required Herblore level to clean a herb can take it toZahur, the herbalist inNardah, who will clean it for 200 coins.

Farming herbs[edit|edit source]

Herbs, grown inherb patches, are a variable yield crop, meaning the resulting number of herbs harvested from a grown plant changes depending on a number of factors, including the player'sFarminglevel, compost usage, item bonuses (magic secateursand theFarming cape),diary bonuses, as well as a linear function that is unique for each herb type (up until level 99 Farming, where the value is the same for all herbs). For more information on variable crop yield, seehere.

Typically at level 99 Farming, with magic secateurs and a Farming cape, one can expect 4.712 herbs with no compost, 6.282 herbs with regularcompost, 7.853 herbs withsupercompostand 9.423 herbs withultracompostfrom a fully grown plant. A practical use calculator, which can be adjusted for one's specific circumstances and will give a more accurate result, can be foundhere.

Obtaining herbs[edit|edit source]

Players can obtain grimy herbs via several methods, perhaps most notably by growing seeds via theFarmingskill and as drops from monsters. They may also receive herbs from theSorceress's Gardenminigame, from their kingdom onMiscellaniaandEtceteria, from thesinister chest, or as a reward from thePest ControlandTemple Trekkingminigames.

As drops[edit|edit source]

Grimy herbs are available as drops from various monsters, including very low-level opponents such asmeninLumbridge. Some monsters drop more herbs than others. Toadflax, snapdragon or torstol are not on the standard herb drop table, these can be obtained from more specific sources; See their respective pages (and the pages of their grimy variant).

Menandwomendrop a surprising variety of herbs including high level herbs. They are only level 2 and are found all overGielinor.Chaos druidsare only level 13, and drop a lot of herbs. Players can find them in theTaverley Dungeon,Edgeville Dungeon, in a tower north ofEast Ardougne, and in theYanille Agility dungeon.Cave crawlersareSlayermonsters that drop both herbs and ingredients, they areverypoisonous, so anAntipoisonis advised.Aberrant spectresareSlayermonsters that drop large numbers of herbs. They can be found inMorytania Slayer Towerand also in theStronghold Slayer Cave. Level 60Slayerand aNose pegor aSlayer helmetare required.Chaos druid warriorsin theYanille Agility dungeondrop a wide variety of secondary ingredients as well as herbs. However, being stronger than ordinary chaos druids, they take longer to kill, which makes them slower for herb gathering.BasilisksareSlayermonsters which drop herbs very often. They have a combat level of 61 and are located in theFremennik Slayer Dungeon. Amirror shieldand aSlayerlevel of 40 are required to kill them. As with chaos druid warriors, while their drop rate is good, their higher combat makes them take longer to kill than other herb droppers.Flesh Crawlersin the level 2Stronghold of Securitydrop herbs frequently, are aggressive to all levels, and can be slain relatively quickly, which makes them ideal for gathering herbs. They hit relatively low for their level, but their attacks are fast, and can be very accurate. In addition, they are frequently crowded on most worlds.Bansheesin theSlayer Towerdrop fewer herbs than chaos druids, but also drop large quantities of notedpure essence. Level 15 Slayer andearmuffsor aSlayer helmetare required.

From the sinister chest[edit|edit source]

Players can also killSalarin the twistedfor theSinister Key, which opens thesinister chest. Players will receive twoharralanders, threeranarr weeds, oneirit leaf, onekwuarm, and onetorstol. BothSalarin the twistedand theSinister chestare found in theYanille Agility dungeon, and players need anAgilitylevel of 67 to reach him. Salarin the twisted, theChaos Fanatic, and theMagpie implingare currently the onlynon-player charactersthat drop thesinister key.

Salarin the twisted can only be injured by one of the four elemental strike spells:Wind Strike,Water Strike,Earth Strike, orFire Strike.Chaos druidsandChaos druid warriorsare also found in this area.

Via Farming[edit|edit source]

Players can also grow their own herbs from seeds via theFarmingskill. They need to obtain the correct seeds for the type of herb they wish to grow, and plant them in a herb patch. At highFarminglevels this can be a very effective method of obtaining experience in both theHerbloreandFarmingskills.

The herb patches unlocked by completingMaking Friends With My ArmandMy Arm's Big Adventurecan be useful, as herbs grown in them cannot becomediseased.

With the easy tier of theKourend & Kebos Diarycomplete, the allotment, herb, and flower patches inHosidiuswill no longer become diseased.

With Champion status in theFortis Colosseum, requiring 16,000Glory, the herb patch west ofCivitas illa Fortiswill no longer become diseased.

From the Miscellania kingdom[edit|edit source]

Players who have completed theThrone of Miscellaniaquest can receive grimy herbs fromMiscellania(seeManaging Miscellania). Players pay an average of 800 coins per herb collected using this method, and receive up to 80 grimy herbs per day, all tarromin or above, if they have enough money in the coffers and have herb-gathering set to maximum.

From Sorceress's Garden[edit|edit source]

Player can obtain clean herbs from theSorceress's Gardenminigame, in which players work their way through a maze to reach a herb patch. Having reached the end, players can pick two random herbs before being teleported back to the beginning of the maze. This takes approximately 50 seconds. It was often crowded with bots because of the easy access and high profit of this minigame.

The lowest garden (Winter) can only yield herbs up to harralanders. The highest garden (Summer) can yield all herbs given normally as a drop besides snapdragon and torstol.
