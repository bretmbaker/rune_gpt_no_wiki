[Minigame: PvP]

Player Killing(commonly known asPKing,player vs. player, orPvP), is the act of two or more players partaking incombatagainst each other. Player killing differs from other forms of combat in that players do not fight againstmonsterswhose actions are defined by RuneScape's game engine. There are various places throughoutOld School RuneScapethat players can participate in PvP activities such asCastle Wars,Soul Wars,Bounty Hunter, and theTzHaar Fight Pit. On every world,the Wildernessacts as a PVP enabled zone, where players of a similar combat bracket can engage each other.

Currently, players can also participate in player killing in dedicated "PvP worlds," where players can attack other players in most places aroundGielinor, with the exception of designated safe areas and banks. There is only one dedicated PvP world that does not change with thePvP world rota, this is World 392. Other worlds can be found on theserverlist.

PvP is a popular activity throughoutOld School RuneScape. Some accounts are even designed solely for PvP, which are colloquially referred to as "pures", who limit or entirely avoid training one or more combat skills, especiallyDefence, so their offensive stats will be much higher than theircombat levelsuggests. Because of their history of success in the Wilderness, and the overall greater amount of experience pures must gain in their individual skills of choice, pures are more effective at player killing than standard accounts of the same level.

Player killing within theWildernessand PvP worlds causes a 57 second timer to be set off, during which only the killer can loot the victim's gear. After the expiry of this timer, anyone can loot the victim's loot.

Gameplay[edit|edit source]

PVP is inherently emergent, meaning the strategies, mechanics, and ways players choose to engage with PVP can change drastically over time.

Honour Fights[edit|edit source]

Are an unwritten, but mutually agreed upon set of rules that players can engage in while fighting each other. This involves players fighting, (commonly with melee), without the help ofProtection prayersorFreezesuntil one player dies or they run out of food. This type of fight relies heavily on knocking out your opponent with high damageSpecial attacks,Vengeanceor other recoiling effects, or combos to defeat an opponent faster than they can out-eat or teleport away. This style of PVP was popular north of Edgeville, but is now commonly facilitated throughBounty HunterorPvP worlds.

No-Honour Fights (NH)[edit|edit source]

An 'anything goes' style of combat, where players use any and all advantages to defeat another player. This includes the use offreezes,Tele Block, and multipleCombat styles. These types of fights are often facilitated in popularWilderness hotspots, where the likelihood of finding other players for a fight is high.Last Man Standingis a popular, safe alternative for players who wish to engage in No-Honour style fights.

"Player Killing"[edit|edit source]

In more specific terms, "Player killers" refers to those who target players skilling, PVMing, questing, or otherwise not engaging in PVP for loot or sport. This is primarily done in theWilderness, where there are plenty of lucrative money makers, unique skilling methods, and bossing encounters that many players seek out. 'Player killers' will have to utilizeTele Block,Freezing spells, high damagingSpecial attacks, or a group of Pkers to defeat other players and prevent their escape.

Anti-Pking[edit|edit source]

Some players participating inWildernessactivities choose to fight back against pkers. This can either be an attempt to deter them or to outright defeat a player killer while bringing substantially less risk thanks to not having toSkull. Players can bring a simple ranged weapon to fight back from a distance, bringfreeze spellsto immobilize and escape from pkers, or use high damagingSpecial attacksandVengeanceto catch player killers off guard.

Team Fights[edit|edit source]

When inmulticombat areas, players can group together to attempt to attack players at the same time. Whether Player killing or fighting other teams, there is extra emphasis on coordinating ranged attacks andBarrage spellsto quickly target and eliminate other players. Many mini-games facilitate safe team fights, such asSoul Wars,Castle Wars, andClan Wars. Larger groups or clans can attempt to control large portions ofthe wildernessfor profit or as a show of force.

Mechanics[edit|edit source]

Player versus player combat behaves similar to player versus monster combat, but there are notable unique interactions and differences that can be initially confusing or unintuitive.

The Wilderness[edit|edit source]

TheWildernessis a large area of land in which any player who enters it is able to attack other players near their combat level. It is a dangerous place as players can die and lose all except their 3 most valuable items, (4 if the player hadProtect Itemon before dying). If the player happened to beskulledfrom attacking another player and said player dies, they will lose all of their items, and only one item iskept upon deathif Protect Item was activated.

Bounty Hunterwas originally released byJagexDecember 2007 as part of the highly controversial update that saw the removal of PvP from the Wilderness, its first incarnation was confined to a single crater and was intended as a substitute for Wilderness player-killing. Although theAugust 2007 archive of RuneScapethatOld School's servers were based on predated the Bounty Hunter update, both players and the development team expressed interest in bringing it back in a revised form. It was subsequently released in 2014 as a single-world activity that exists separately from and alongside traditional Wilderness PvP.

Clan Warsallows members of two opposingClan Chatsto engage in player-versus-player combat against one another.

Castle Warsis aminigamereleased byJagexin December 2004. It is similar to Capture the Flag, but with aRuneScapetwist. The official worlds for Castle Wars are 334 and 354 for P2P, and 383 for F2P. On July 202017, it was madeFree-to-play, and can be accessed via a portal in theFerox Enclave.

Players will be able to register their interest in finding a fight; while a match is being prepared, players can continue with whatever they were doing prior.

History[edit|edit source]

Originally, after the release ofRuneScape Classic, players could select whether or not to play as player killer characters. Players could switch from player-killer mode to non-player-killer mode (in which the character could not attack or be attacked by other players) three times, after which they remained at their chosen setting "forever".

PvP combat could take place at most locations in theRuneScapeworld. The rules of combat were the same as in modernRuneScape ClassicWilderness.Lumbridgewas designated as a neutral area where players could not attack each other. This was done to prevent "spawn camping", the practice of immediately killing a player as soon as they respawned after a death. However, it was possible for a character to be attacked in the upper levels ofLumbridge Castle. In addition to this restriction,NPCGuardsandWhite Knightspatrolled the cities ofVarrockandFalador, breaking up PvP battles by attacking the aggressor. These guard units were limited in number, however, and if all the units in a city were already in combat, PvP combat could go on freely.

At this time, the Bank of Runescape was limited to Varrock and Falador and could only storecoins. As a result, players would have to carry their valuables with them, making PvP combat much riskier.

The player-killer/non-player-killer modes were, however, removed from the game on13 August2001when the Wilderness was added. Later, additional areas where PvP combat was allowed were added.
