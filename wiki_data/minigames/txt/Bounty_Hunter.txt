Bounty Hunter, commonly abbreviated asBH, is aplayer killingminigamelocated in theWildernessatDaimon's Crater. Upon entering the crater, the player will be given another player within 5 (adjustable to 10 or 15 by speaking with theEmblem Trader) combat levels of them as a target. Besides the usual items dropped on death, players who successfully kill their target will be rewarded with Bounty Hunter points, which can be used at the Emblem Trader'sBounty Hunter Store.

Mechanics[edit|edit source]

Coffer[edit|edit source]

To participate in Bounty Hunter, players are required to put minimum deposit ofcoinsinto theBounty Hunter coffer. The minimum deposit depends on the player's combat level:

Combat Level | Minimum Deposit

32-60 | 30,000

61-88 | 50,000

89-110 | 100,000

111-126 | 150,000

Upon a player's death, an amount of coins are deducted from the coffer. Non-skulled players lose coins equal to their minimum deposit, whileskulledplayers only lose10,000.

Skulls[edit|edit source]

Bounty Hunter uses unique versions of the skull symbol that indicates how much a player is currently risking. A skull with yellow eyes indicates a player is also skulled.

Bronze — less than200,000Silver — between200,000and800,000Green — between800,000and2,000,000Blue — between2,000,000and8,000,000Red — more than8,000,000

Fighting[edit|edit source]

When you enter the crater, you will spawn somewhere in the arena and be given a target from amongst the other players in the minigame. While in the crater,teleportationis blocked, thoughTeleport to Targetmay be used if the player has not been in combat within the last 12 seconds. Additionally,protection prayerscannot be used,phoenix necklaceswill not activate, and binding spells such asiceandgrasp spellswill not stop players' movement.

Players may create bounty supply crates to bring in more supplies. These come in two variants:manta ray cratesandanglerfish crates. Crates are filled with eightblighted manta rays/blighted anglerfish, twoblighted karambwan, oneblighted super restore(4), and 1,000 coins. Up to two crates may be brought inside Bounty Hunter at a time, although players may make and store these crates en masse.

Equipmentending in the (bh)suffixare used exclusively during Bounty Hunter, providing very strong bonuses andspecial attacks. These weapons and armour (most being variants ofAncient Warriors' equipment) can be obtained from theBounty Hunter Storeby either purchasing directly, or by purchasing an imbue scroll to upgrade a regular item. These items (excluding the imbued items) must be charged with5,000,000(armour, Vesta's spear, Zuriel's staff, Morrigan's throwing axe),10,000,000(Statius's warhammer, Morrigan's javelin), or50,000,000(Vesta's longsword) before they can be used. Upon dying in PvP, the coins used to activate the item are given to the killer, and players are left with the inactive item.

Players who do not have the level 78 Defence requirement to wear Ancient Warriors' equipment can talk to theCorrupted Warriorto convert the item to its corrupted variant and vice versa. Corrupted Ancient Warriors' equipment only requires 20 Defence, but has far lower bonuses than its uncorrupted variant.

Bounty Hunter points[edit|edit source]

Each target kill will earn you two Bounty Hunter points, which can be traded for rewards at theBounty Hunter Store. In addition, bonus points are rewarded for milestone kills:

Total Kill Count | Bonus Points

Per 10th | 3

Per 50th | 5

Per 100th | 10

Per 500th | 25

Besides the points earned from kills, players can earn extra points by leveling up and trading inesoteric emblems. A tier 1 emblem will drop on your first target kill, or it can be bought from the Bounty Hunter Store for two points. Each target kill will rank up your own emblem. Dying with an emblem will reduce its tier by 1. If the emblem has a tier of 1 upon death, it will be removed.

The following table shows how many points each emblem is worth:

Emblem Tier | BH Point Value

1 | 2

2 | 4

3 | 7

4 | 11

5 | 16

6 | 22

7 | 29

8 | 37

9 | 46

10 | 56

Target Skipping & Penalties[edit|edit source]

A player may skip up to two skulled targets within a thirty-minute window without incurring a penalty. Once a player skips their third skulled target, they will be blocked from matchmaking for thirty minutes. (You can skip unskulled targets without penalty) After the thirty minutes, the points rewarded after the first target killed will be halved and an esoteric emblem will not be dropped (if they don't already have one). If the player has an esoteric emblem in their inventory instead, it will not be upgraded.
