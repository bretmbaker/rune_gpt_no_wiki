Gameplay[edit|edit source]

Players with very fewHitpointsmay need to bring somefooddue to the rough nature of this game. The objective of the game is to get a gnome ball from the referee, and then throw it through the net at the other end of the pitch. Weapons are automatically unequipped and placed in the inventory when entering the game.

This game has three simple mechanics:

Pass- The gnomeball can be passed to another participating player or either of the two greengnome wingers. The gnome wingers will pass it back after a few seconds.Tackle- Gnomes of opposing teams can be tackled, knocking them out for a few seconds. However, gnomes may also tackle the player who is holding the ball, dealing 1–2 damage. When someone holding the gnomeball is tackled, they will lose the ball to the one who tackled them. The chance of tackling and being tackled depends on the player'sAgilitylevel.Shoot- Players must attempt to shoot the gnomeball at thegnome goal. The chance to successfully score depends on the player'sRangedlevel and the proximity to the goal. When a goal is scored, the player that scored will receive a point. Whether the ball hit or missed, a new ball has to be asked from the gnome ball referee.

Whenever a player earns five points, they win the game and their score is reset.

Strategy[edit|edit source]

The simplest tactic is to pass the gnome ball to a gnome winger directly after receiving the ball. Then, run forward towards the goal. When the winger passes it back, shoot it at the goal. This strategy should also prevent any gnomes from attacking the player.

Rewards[edit|edit source]

For every successful goal, a low amount (4–7) of Agility and Ranged experience is granted. Winning the game will reward an additional 25 experience in both skills.If the player earns five points, they will receive agnomeballupon exiting the pitch. Gnomeballs are worth25,832coins on theGrand Exchange. Only one gnomeball may be awarded per game. Gnomeballs brought onto the pitch will be kept by the gnome ball referee until the player leaves the game. Additionally, players that brought a gnomeball to the game will not receive a new one from winning.
