[Weapon: Echo Boots]


Echo bootsare an enhanced pair ofguardian bootswhich require level 75Defenceto wear. They are made by combining the boots with anecho crystal, a rare drop from participating in theFortis Colosseum. Compared to its predecessor, it gives an additional +2prayer bonusand a passive effect in which the boots deal 1 recoil damage to targets attacking the player, in a 3x3 square around the player. This effectively restricts recoiled targets to those in melee range.
Each echo crystal will add 6,000 charges to the recoil effect (costing530.33per charge), up to a maximum of 60,000. The recoil effect can be toggled via the boot's "Toggle-activity" option, allowing players to disable it as to not waste it during casual training, and instead use it in activities where the effect may prove more useful. The "Revert" option reverts the echo boots back into guardian boots, though thiswill notreturn any echo crystals, regardless of whether or not any recoil charges were used. Players can configure the charges while the boots are in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials.
