[Weapon: Graceful Boots#Worn]


Graceful bootsare a part of thegraceful outfit, costing 40marks of gracefromGracein theRogues' Den. When worn, they reduceweightby 4 kg and increase therun energyrestoration rate by 3%; this is increased to 30% when the full outfit is worn.
Although theboots of lightnessare easily obtained and reduce weight by 4.5 kg (compared to 4 kg of the Graceful boots), the Graceful boots are needed for the full outfit's effect, which increases the run energy restore rate by 30%. With this in mind, it is most practical to buy the bootslastif buying pieces of the Graceful clothing set one-by-one.
