[Weapon: Boots Of The Eye]


Theboots of the eyeis a part of theRaiments of the Eyeset, purchased from theGuardians of the Riftreward shop for 250abyssal pearls. It grants 10% more runes whenRunecrafting, and is increased to 60% when the full set is worn.
Unlike other pieces of the outfit, the boots cannot be recoloured. Attempting to do so anyway results in a chatbox message:You try to apply the dye to your boots but for some reason they seem to repel the liquid. You manage to return the dye to the bottle. Perhaps it would be better used on something else?
