[Weapon: Xeric%27S Talisman#Charged]


Xeric's talismanis an amulet that can be charged usinglizardman fangs(costing16coins per charge) that allows the player to teleport to various locations throughoutGreat Kourend. The amulet is an untradeable rare drop from killinglizardmen,brutesandshamans, or can alternatively be obtained by stealing fromstone chestsin theLizardman TemplebeneathMolch. The drop rate from monsters can be improved from 1/250 to 1/125 after completion of theeasy Kourend & Kebos Diary,but the drop rate from the stone chests remains at 1/300 regardless of diary completion. It can most easily be obtained from the lizardmen at a small skirmish next to a tent just slightly north ofLacerta Fallsdue to the abundance of NPC allies, multicombat fighting, and quick respawns.
Upon obtaining the talisman, it is inert and uncharged. Each fang provides one charge for the talisman which can hold a maximum of 1,000 charges. The charges can be refunded, returning the fangs used to charge it and reverting the talisman to its inert state. Players can configure the charges while the talisman is in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials.
