[Weapon: Berserker Necklace]


Theberserker necklaceis anonyx necklaceenchanted by theLvl-6 Enchantspell. When worn, it increases the amount of damage the wearer does when wielding an obsidian melee weapon (Toktz-xil-ak,Tzhaar-ket-om,Tzhaar-ket-em, orToktz-xil-ek) by 20%. However, in exchange it lowers the wearer's melee accuracy and the player's defences against all combat styles. This bonus stacks with the bonus provided from wearing theObsidian armour set(helmet,platebody, andplatelegs). It also stacks withslayer helmetandVoid Knight equipment.
Players can attach aBerserker necklace ornament kit, obtained fromhardTreasure Trails, to create aBerserker necklace (or). This is only cosmetic, and does not affect the necklace's stat bonuses. It can be dismantled, returning the necklace and ornament kit.
