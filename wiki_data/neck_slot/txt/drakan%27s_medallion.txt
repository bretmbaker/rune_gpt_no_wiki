[Weapon: Drakan%27S Medallion]


Drakan's medallionis a reward from the questA Taste of Hope. It allows unlimitedteleportationtoVer Sinhaza,Darkmeyer(after completion ofSins of the Father), and theSisterhood SanctuaryunderSlepe(after using aSlepey tableton it, which is a rare drop fromPhosani's Nightmare). Players cannot teleport past level 20Wilderness.
The main purpose of the medallion is for easy teleportation to theTheatre of Blood. In addition, the teleport location is decently close to a bank, making the medallion an easier to obtain but less effective alternative to theCrafting cape.
