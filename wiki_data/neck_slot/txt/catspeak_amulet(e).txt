[Weapon: Catspeak Amulet(E)]


Theenchanted catspeak amuletis an amulet worn in the neck slot obtained duringA Tail of Two Catsby handing over a regularcatspeak amuletand 5death runestoHildinBurthorpe. Like the unenchanted version, you can speak to cats while wearing it. The main difference is that it can also be used to locateBob the Jagex cat'sgeneral direction. To do so, right click the amulet, use the "Open" option which will open a compass-like interface in the shape of a cat, and turn the compass clockwise or anti-clockwise by clicking on the whiskers until the eyes are lit and the cat's mouth starts moving.
After the events ofDragon Slayer II, opening the amulet simply results in the message, "You look at the amulet and take a moment to remember your fallen friend."
