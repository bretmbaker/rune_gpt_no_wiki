Thealchemist's amuletis an item purchased from theMixology Rewardsshop with 6,900Mox resin, 5,650Aga resin, and 7,400Lye resin, which are earned from participating in theMastering Mixologyminigame. While the amulet is equipped, there is a 15% chance the player will create a potion with an extra dose when brewing potions (but with no extra experience), which consumes one charge. This effect works when adding secondaries to potions with fewer than 3 doses, such asanti-venomandstamina potions.
When first purchased, the amulet is pre-charged with 50 uses. Additional charges can be added by usingamulets of chemistryon it - with each giving 10 charges - up to a maximum of 5,000. On average, each Amulet of chemistry added will last for ~67 potions made, giving a fully charged Alchemist's amulet ~33,333 potions made, of which, 5000 will have an extra dose.
