[Weapon: Cat Training Medal]


Acat training medalis anitemworn in the neck slot thatmemberscan obtain by having theircatorkittencatch 100rats, and then talking toGertrudeinVarrock.Hell-ratsare included in this count, as well ashell-rat behemoths.[1]This item has no effect when worn, and is only for show. If players lose or drop their training medal, they may talk to Gertrude to get another one.
Kittens have a low chance of catching rats, so it is recommended to wait until your kitten has grown into a cat before you try to catch rats. The cat must catch the rats before it turns into an overgrown cat, which cannot hunt vermin. Players who only have overgrown cats must buy another kitten from Gertrude (or wait for it to becomelazy). Note thatwilycats arenoteligible for a medal, and training an overgrown cat into a wily cat alsoresets the rat kill counter to zeroeven after it becomes lazy. Receiving a new kitten from Gertrude will also reset the counter, as will letting a cat mature into an overgrown one.[2]
