[Weapon: Dodgy Necklace]


Adodgy necklaceis anopal necklaceenchanted via theLvl-1 Enchantspell.
While equipped, the necklace provides a 25% chance to prevent the player from beingstunnedand damaged whilepickpocketingNPCs. The necklace begins with 10 charges; one charge is consumed each time the necklace successfully prevents damage. When the last charge is consumed, the necklace crumbles to dust. This stacks multiplicatively with the spellShadow Veil, where Shadow Veil will attempt to avoid the stun first for a total of 36.25% chance to not take damage from a failed pickpocket. As the player cannot fail a pickpocket attempt on a knocked out NPC, damage taken duringblackjackingcan only be received by failing a knockout; as such, a dodgy necklace will have no effect on blackjacking.
