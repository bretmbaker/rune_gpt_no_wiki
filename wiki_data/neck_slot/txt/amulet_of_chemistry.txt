[Weapon: Amulet Of Chemistry]


Anamulet of chemistryis ajade amuletenchanted via theLvl-2 Enchantspell.
Each amulet begins with five charges. While the amulet is equipped, there is a 5% chance that you will create a 4-dose potion rather than a 3-dose potion when brewing potions (but with no extra experience), which consumes one charge. Once all of the amulet's charges are used up, the amulet crumbles to dust. When the amulet crumbles to dust, the player will either continue making potions or stop depending on the choice selected in the Options menu of the amulet. Each amulet lasts for an average of 100 potions made.
