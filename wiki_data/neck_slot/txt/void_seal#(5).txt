[Weapon: Void Seal#(5)]


TheVoid sealis a piece ofVoid Knight equipmentreward in thePest Controlactivity. It can be bought from a Void Knight for 10 commendation points. Unlike the rest of the Void Knight equipment, players do not require at least 42Attack,Strength,Defence,Hitpoints, along with 22Prayerto buy and wield one. This item is worn in theneck slot. The seal will inflict 8-12 Hitpoints of damage upon nearby Pests when the player rubs it. The seal has eight charges. Once its 8 charges are used, it dissolves. It can only be utilised in Pest Control games, and is useless in normal combat except for its slight defensive bonuses.
Due to the void seal's limited uses and the fact that it gives no experience, it is very rarely purchased. Aside from this, activating the seal does not provide any boost in the player's activity bar.
