If worn whilst woodcutting,bird nestdrops are slightly less likely to contain seeds, and slightly more likely to containbird's eggsorrings[1](changing the rate from 3/100 to 3/95[2]). If worn whilst lootingbird houses, bird nest drops are slightly less likely to be empty nests, and slightly more likely to contain eggs or rings.[3]Generally, this means the strung rabbit foot is always beneficial to wear whilst looting birdhouses and woodcutting, since the egg nest gives you another nest at the Woodcutting Guild.
