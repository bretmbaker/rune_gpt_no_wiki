[Weapon: Binding Necklace]


Thebinding necklaceis an enchanted jewellery item that gives the wearer a 100% success rate in makingcombination runesthrough theRunecraftskill. It has 16 uses (one use is one click on an altar) and will be destroyed once all are used. It has a right-click "check" option that shows how many charges are left.
Similar to aring of recoil, binding necklace charges are stored per player, not per necklace. Thus if the player sells or casts High Level Alchemy on a necklace with 1 charge remaining, the next necklace the player equips will still have only 1 charge. The player can right-click to "destroy" a binding necklace, destroying it and restoring the next binding necklace the player equips to 16 charges. This can be useful when a necklace drops to 1 charge left and a player is crafting runes in pairs, where a player can destroy a second necklace in their inventory and the equipped one will regain charges.
