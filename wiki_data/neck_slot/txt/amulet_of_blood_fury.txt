[Passive Effect]
When dealing melee damage, the amulet grants a passive 20% chance to heal 30% of the damage dealt on any hit. On average, players will heal for roughly 6% of the melee damage they deal. This can trigger independently fromGuthan the Infested's equipmentability, and could potentially happen at the same time.[1]
Once created, the amulet has 10,000 charges. Additional blood shards can be used to charge the amulet up to a maximum of 30,000 charges - each additional blood shard adds 10,000 charges. Players can configure the charges while the amulet is in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials. A charge is depleted for everysuccessfulmelee hit regardless of whether the amulet's effect triggers. One charge currently costs1,346.34coins. For weapons that hit multiple times per attack (such asscythe of vitur), it may consume multiple charges per swing. When it runs out of charges, the blood shard breaks, leaving the player with only the amulet of fury.
Shard lifespan will greatly depend on the player's attack speed and accuracy. Assuming 100% accuracy:
With a 4 tick weapon (such as theabyssal whiporGhrazi rapier), one shard will last for 6.7 hours of sustained combat before depleting (2,009,455per hour).With a 5 tick weapon (such as theOsmumten's fangorsoulreaper axe), one shard will last 8.3 hours (1,608,524per hour).With a 5 tick weapon hitting three times (such as theScythe of vitur), one shard will last 2.8 hours (4,691,063per hour).
The total health that a fully charged amulet will heal is approximately the player's maximum hit multiplied by 300: for example, with a setup with a maximum hit of 50, the amulet will heal 15,000 hit points on average before breaking. This is equivalent to 750sharkswhich would cost711,000.
