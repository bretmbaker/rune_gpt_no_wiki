The Varrock Diary is a set of achievement diaries whose tasks revolve around areas in and near Varrock , such as the Barbarian Village and Edgeville .
Several skill, quest and item requirements are needed to complete all tasks. Unless stated otherwise, temporary skill boosts can be used to meet the skill requirements.
Rewards can be claimed from Toby in Varrock , just behind the Varrock General Store . Note that the previous tiers of a diary must be completed to claim rewards of the next tier.
Note that if the player's available discounted battlestaves were purchased for the day and that same day the next tier of Diary is completed: you will not be able to purchase the additional discounted battlestaves from Zaff you would unlock from completing that diary until the time the dailies reset, even after logging out or switching worlds.
For example: If 60 of the 60 available battlestaves have been purchased for the Hard Tier and that same day you complete the Elite Varrock Diary, you will not be able to purchase the remaining 60 of the 120 that you would receive for completing the Elite Diary until the time dailies reset. The full 120 will be available for purchase upon the time dailies reset at 00:00 UTC.
