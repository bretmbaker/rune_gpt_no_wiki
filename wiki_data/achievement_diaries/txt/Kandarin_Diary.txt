Trivia [ edit | edit source ]
In RuneScape , this diary is known as the Seers' Village achievement set , which gives the reward of the Seer's headband . The first Kandarin headgear pays homage to this, as it is a leather headband that transforms into a helm after higher tiers are completed.
There were a few hints from the Old School RuneScape team about the enhanced excalibur before the diary update, but it wasn't added due to the fact that it would devalue the Saradomin godsword and Guthan's set.
The task to equip a granite platebody would reset when the item was banked. This was later fixed.
