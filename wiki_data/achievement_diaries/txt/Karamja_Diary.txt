Trivia [ edit | edit source ]
Karamja Diary's design is slightly different than other Achievement Diaries: The antique lamp experience for the completion of each tier is different than the other diaries. Completing each task, or all tasks of a tier, results in a completion music. This music is different for each tier, with the exception of the elite tier having no music at all. The diary had different taskmasters for each tier: Pirate Jackie the Fruit for the easy tier, Kaleb Paramaya for the medium tier, the Jungle forester for the hard tier, and TzHaar-Mej for the elite tier. This was changed in an update on 30 March 2017.
