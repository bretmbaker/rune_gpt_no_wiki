Old School RuneScapeisJagex's official term for a previous version of theRuneScapegame that was introduced from theAugust 2007 Archive of RuneScape, a backup of theRuneScapesource code as it had been on10 August2007. It is also commonly referred to asOSRSor2007scape.
This version of the game was announced in anews poston13 February2013, which was followed by the opening of a poll to determine community interest on15 February2013. The poll, which ended1 March2013, decided, among other things, whether an additionalmembershipfee would be charged for access to the game.[1][2]
The poll ended at 00:00 UTC on Friday1 March2013with the final tally of votes at 449,351.[2]Although 500,000 votes were needed to allow no additional membership fee, Jagex stated that the first six months ofOld School RuneScapewill not have any additional charge. It has since remained open without any additional charge. Currently,Old School RuneScapeis running bothfree-to-playandpay-to-playservers, and players can create new F2P accounts for free without having to pay for membership.
Despite it having originally been stated that servers would take one to two months to be opened following a successful poll, on22 February2013 as part of an Early Access scheme, Jagex opened over 50Old School RuneScapeservers and gave a month of freeOld School RuneScapemembership credit to it to all of those who had voted in the poll. The game quickly saw player counts equalling those ofRuneScape.
Old School RuneScapeworks similarly toRuneScape Classicin that players can use theirmain accountsto access both games. However, any accomplishments, such asstats,itemsandquests, are separate and non-transferable. All players, regardless of achievements in other versions of the game, beginOld School RuneScapeonTutorial Islandwith a new character.
Old School RuneScapeis rated16by thePan European Game Informationcommittee,[3]andMA15+by theAustralian Classification Board[4]. WhileOld School RuneScapeis not rated by theEntertainment Software Rating Board, the equivalent rating would beTeen.
2007 servers ofRuneScapewere originally announced in early2013.Jagexallowed players to vote forOld School RuneScapeon a referendum, promising a set of features for every vote mark level reached. The servers were based on abackupof RuneScape that was created on 10 August 2007.
Old School RuneScapewas in four different levels, each with increasing vote requirements. The amount of votes can be seen onthe official vote page. Regardless of the outcome, any voter will get a free month of Old School RuneScape game time. Although the vote count only reached 449,351 and not 500,000,Jagexdecided not to charge the additional fee of five USD for the first six months (excluding the free month); however, on7 June2013, they announced that OSRS is here to stay and there will be no additional fee.[5]
Note: The green shading in the table above only shows the vote mark reached on1 March2013and the features that would have been given according to that vote mark. There have been many changes since the poll ended;click hereto view them.
The first level requires 50,000 votes, and is the absolute minimum amount of votes required to guarantee the Old School RuneScape release.
The second level requires 250,000 votes.
The third level requires 500,000 votes.
The fourth level requires 750,000 votes.
The following table shows the features that were introduced into OSRS. Jagex allowed other features from the 500,000 vote mark to be introduced in the game.
Most new content in the game is decided byJagex-run polls based on player feedback obtained from social media such as Twitter/X and Reddit. Players must have at a total level of at least 280 inOld School RuneScapeto be eligible to vote in these polls. In order for a poll to be successful, it must be supported by 70% of the votes. Players could vote on Old School RuneScape's poll page on the official website (prior to this features' removal) and currently vote in-game via poll booths that are located in every bank, or via theaccount managementcommunity tab.
After initially remaining largely identical to the original 2007 version for the first few months after launch (save for minor bug fixes and quality of life changes), theGod Wars Dungeonand theNightmare Zonewere introduced as the first major updates forOld School(the former was present in thearchive, the latter was the game's first entirely original content update). In the years since, new quests (Monkey Madness II,Dragon Slayer II, theGreat Kourend quest series), areas (Kebos Lowlands,Ver Sinhaza,Weiss), and skilling updates (Rooftop Agility,Aerial fishing, theMotherlode Mine) have gradually transformedOld Schoolinto a unique game separate and distinct from the "vanilla" version. The game world is thus in a unique position of containing updates from 2001-2007 and from 2013 to the present, with low-resolution locations likeLumbridgeandArdougneexisting alongside more modern-looking locations likeMount KaruulmandFossil Island.
Some quest series that have remained incomplete inOld School RuneScapehave also been continued, having a diverged path from itsRuneScapestoryline, such asA Taste of HopeandSong of the Elves. AsOld School RuneScapeis an alternate take of theRuneScapeuniverse, key events within the quest's storyline remain the same, but the circumstances in which those events occur may differ fromRuneScape's timeline.[6]For example, in A Taste of Hope, the player faces and killsRanis Drakan, while inRuneScape's questThe Branches of Darkmeyer, it isVanescula Drakanwho kills him.
Holiday itemswere first introduced into the game during the2013 Rare Dropsevent, where holiday items dropped randomly around the world, similar to the original holiday item drops. Each world only had one item spawned at a time in location chosen randomly from a predetermined list. Items stayed visible for 30 minutes or until they were picked up, at which point they would randomly respawn again. The first drop was held in the first week of June. Players could also obtain holiday items by killing aJagex Moderator.
Later on, all holiday items from previous events were rewarded in bulk for completion of the corresponding holiday events (players completing anEaster eventwould receive all holiday items from previous Easter holiday events). This also included newly added holiday items unique to Old Schoolâ€”e.g. therainbow partyhat.
