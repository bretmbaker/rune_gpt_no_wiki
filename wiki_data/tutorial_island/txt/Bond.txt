[Page: Old school bond]

Anold school bond, commonly referred to as a bond, is an item that allows a player to pay formembership, both forOld School RuneScapeandRuneScape 3, on their account. Bonds can be purchased fromJagexfor real-world money or inRuneScapefor in-game money, keepingRuneScapeas a free-to-play game. However, bonds are expensive, requiring time to gain enoughcoinsfor aplayerto be able to afford a bond from theGrand Exchange. Bonds can be redeemed in-game for membership or traded with other players forcoinsor items, providing a means for players to buy membership with in-game items or (indirectly) in-game items with real-world money.
When bought with real-world money fromJagex, tradeable bonds are added to the bond pouch. These bonds may be traded with other players, sold on theGrand Exchange, or used on another player to donate it to them for free, including onironmenplayers. Any of these transfers makes the bond untradeable and unable to be donated.
Players can convert untradeable bonds into tradeable bonds again by choosing the "Convert" option and paying 10% of a tradeable bond's current Grand Exchange value (1,480,778 coins). The total cost of buying and converting a bond is16,288,558 coins.
Players can store up to 100 bonds (tradeable, untradeable, or a mix of both) in their bond pouch. This is a feature of each player'sOld School RuneScapeaccount rather than an in-game item, and can be accessed via theAccount Managementinterface. Attempting to buy more from the in-game interface whilst it is full will result in a game message statingYour bonds pouch is full. Please empty it before buying more.However, players can continue to buy additional bonds via the game's website, albeit they will not be given until there is sufficient space within the bond pouch when the player next logs in; a game message accompanies this, statingYour Bond Pouch is too full to hold your recent purchase. The game will try again next time you log in, if there is space then.
Bonds can never be dropped, destroyed,alchemised, or sold inshops. They are alwayskept on death, even when inside theWilderness. The only way a player can get rid of a bond, other than by using it, is by trading it.
Players may only buy or sell one bond per Grand Exchange slot. They are the only item thatironmenare permitted to purchase on the Grand Exchange via a special ironman-only interface.
At any time, whether tradeable or untradeable, a player can redeem one or more of their bonds for membership:
Members can change their display name using the option in their Account Management interface or on theRuneScapewebsite under Account Settings. A player can do this once every 28 days for free, or can spend 1 bond from their bond pouch to do so without having to wait. Note that if a player changes their display name on the website after already having changed it once, they may choose their previous name, but when changing their display name in-game, they may not.
The following table shows the average cost incoinsper day of membership, based on the Grand Exchange price of bonds. This could be interpreted as the amount of money a player would need to make per day on average if planning on paying for membership by buying bonds in-game.
