[Page: Skippy]

Skippyis a man found behindHetty's house inRimmington. He appears to be drunk and the player must make him sober to find out what happened to him. He wanders along the coast throwing bottles at the sea, resulting ina pile of broken glassand yells threats to seemingly no one, although after becoming sober he explains that he was attacked bymogresthat dwell in the sea.
To sober Skippy up, abucket of watermust be used on him. Once this is done, he will say he wants somenettle tea. To make this, use somenettleswith abowl of water, then heat it on a range. Give it to him and he will then say he needs ahangover cure(made by mixingchocolate dustwith abucket of milkto getchocolatey milk, then mixing it withsnape grass). Once this has been done, he will tell the player about the mogres that attacked him, and the player will learn how to slaymogres(level 32Slayerrequired).
At times, Skippy can be found onTutorial Islandnear theGielinor Guide, and will allow players to skip the tutorial. DuringOld School RuneScape's launch he was placed onto Tutorial Island to help deal with the large amount of incoming players, and could teleport players straight toLumbridge. During the launch ofHardcoreIronman ModeSkippy could be used to skip toJuanat the end of Tutorial Island, where people could choose their Ironman status before teleporting to Lumbridge. Skippy also appears on Tutorial Island duringDeadman Modeevents, and can teleport players to their choice of Lumbridge,Varrock,Falador, EastArdougne, and theGnome Stronghold. Upon using Skippy, players will obtain all of the tutorial island starter items.
Skippy is not used on Tutorial Island regularly because having all players do the entire tutorial is a useful tactic to mitigatebottingand allowing the tutorial to be permanently skipped would likely increase the amount of bots in Old School RuneScape.[1]
