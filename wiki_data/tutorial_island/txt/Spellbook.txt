[Page: Spellbook]

Aspellbookis a list ofmagicspells available for casting to a player. There are currently four spellbooks: thestandard spellbook, theAncient Magicksspellbook, theLunar spellbookand theArceuus spellbook. Ancient Magicks and the Lunar spellbook require a quest to be completed in order to unlock them. A player may only cast spells from their current spellbook, and if they wish to use spells from another spellbook, they must change to that spellbook.
It is possible to switch between spellbooks by visiting altars associated with those spellbooks, with the standard spellbook being accessible at theAncient Pyramidaltar,Astral Altar, andTyssnear theDark Altar. It is often most efficient to utilizeplayer-owned house altars.
Players may use filters to alter the contents of their spellbook. Filters can be enabled through the right-click menu of the spellbook icon on the player's UI. Once enabled, filters can be modified using the "Filters" button at the bottom of the spellbook.
Available filters include:
Once a player checks or unchecks the desired filter, tapping the "Filters" button again will display the filtered interface. If enough spells are filtered out, the spell icons will become enlarged to make them easier to tap. This feature can be toggled via the "Filters" button, but only for non-PvP-enabled areas.
Players who wish to change their currently active spellbook have several options:
Thestandard spellbookis a set of modern spells available to all players, being unlocked by default upon character creation. Having the most spells of any spellbook, standard spells make use of all runes exceptastral.
Staves are also required to cast some of the spells, includingIban's staff,slayer's stafforstaff of the dead,Saradomin stafforstaff of light,Zamorak staff, andGuthix stafforvoid knight mace.
TheArceuus spellbookis a set of spells utilised byCitizens of Arceuus, and is the only other spellbook available to all players by default. Like thestandard spellbook, it has a variety of offensive and utility spells at its disposal, unlike the Lunar spellbook, which is primarily focused on utility spells, and theAncient Magicks, which is heavily combat-oriented.
Making extensive use ofblood,natureandsoul runes, the spellbook makes use ofreanimation spellsused inprayer training, and possesses an array ofteleportationspells to the mainland, which primarily teleports players to locations associated with death, such as graveyards and dungeons with undead. Alongside the reanimation and teleport spells, a larger set of combat and utility spells are accessible to players who have completed the questA Kingdom Divided.
Ancient Magicksare a set ofZarosianspells available to players upon completion of the questDesert Treasure I. Unlike theLunar spellbook, which primarily focuses onutility spells, and thestandard spellbook, which is a mixture ofcombatand utility spells, the Ancient Magicks is significantly combat-oriented, including some of the most powerful combat spells in the game.
Having far fewer spells than the other spellbooks, many spells of the Ancient Magicks are very rune-intensive and require expensive runes such asdeathandblood runes. Owing to their power (a minimum of 50 Magic is needed to even access the spellbook), Ancient Magick spells are popular inplayer-versus-playeractivities.
TheLunar spellbookis a set of spells utilised by people of theMoon Clan, available to players upon completion of the questLunar Diplomacy. Making extensive use ofastral runes, the spellbook is primarily oriented towards utility spells and combat-support spells, reducing or eliminating the need for certain items and equipment to carry out certain tasks, in contrast to the combat-heavy Ancient Magicks and the varied spell types of the standard and Arceuus spellbooks.
A larger set of spells are accessible to players who have completed the questDream Mentor, while two spells,Tan LeatherandRecharge Dragonstone, are unlocked by completing theHard Fremennik Diary.
