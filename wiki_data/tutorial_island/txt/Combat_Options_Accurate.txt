Melee weapons[edit|edit source]

Meleeweaponsvary in their attack styles. Some have three options, one for each combat style. Others have four options, the extra one typically being either acontrolledoption or an alternativeaggressiveattack.

Attack types[edit|edit source]

Selecting type will change the player's accuracy. Bonuses can be seen in theEquipment Stats interface. The player's accuracy rolls are determined by their selected attack type. This applies to special attacks too. The player's accuracy roll rolls against their opponent's matching type defence. There are exceptions; most special attacks are rolled always against a predefined type. The general rule is that you can determine the attack's  type from its special attack animation. Slashing specials roll against slash defence, and crushing animations against crush defence (dragon dagger / crystal halberd special attacks' selected type accuracy roll will roll against an opponent's slash defence).[1]

There currently isn't a player wieldable melee weapon that calculates accuracy from magic or ranged bonus, but there is ranged weapon, thedwarf multicannon, which calculates accuracy using the player's Ranged or melee bonus depending on the weapon and attack style, detailed inthe accuracy sectionof its page.

Magic weapons[edit|edit source]

While wielding aMagicweapon(commonly astaff), a player can use the normalmelee attack stylesinMeleecombat, or use theAutocastoption to automatically attack with aspell. Selecting this option will bring up a list of spells that can be autocast, which varies with each magical weapon. If the player selects a spell, the selected spell is repeatedly cast during combat as long as the player has the required Magic level and has the requiredrunes. While a player has the autocast option chosen, they must also choose either the normal or defensive style to represent how they are casting their Magic.

Unlike other combat styles and powered staves, autocasting does not give invisible bonuses.

If a player chooses thestandardstyle for autocasting, they perform a normal magical attack and for each point of damage the spell deals, they gain 2 experience inMagicand 1.33 experience inHitpoints, in addition to the Magic experience from casting the spell.

If a player chooses thedefensivestyle for autocasting, they perform a normal magical attack and for each point of damage the spell deals, they gain 1.33 experience inMagic, 1 experience inDefence, and 1.33 experience inHitpoints.
