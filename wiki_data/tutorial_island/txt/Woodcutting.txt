[Page: Woodcutting]

Woodcuttingis a gatheringskillthat primarily involves chopping trees to obtain logs used in theFletching,Firemaking, andConstructionskills. Players with a higher Woodcutting level can chop down new types of trees and cut down trees quicker, especially as higher levels ofaxesbecome available.
Woodcutting is a useful skill for a low-levelled player to make money early in the game. On the map, locations of rare trees can be located with a treeicon.
Players looking for a more social Woodcutting experience can partake inForestry. To begin, grab aForestry kitfrom theForestry ShopinDraynor,Seers' VillageorPrifddinas.
Memberscan also grow their own trees to chop using theFarmingskill. Additionally, at level 60 Woodcutting and above (which can be boosted), members can gain access to theWoodcutting Guild, containing a wide variety of useful features.
Various equipment may be used to interact with trees. Most trees require an axe to chop.
Similar to their regular counterpart, when used withForester's rations, felling axes provide an extra 10% Woodcutting experience with a 20% chance to not receive a log when chopping trees.
Besides axes, other equipment is useful for the Woodcutting skill.
Both Woodcutting level and tier of axe determines players' speed of chopping logs. Players with high enoughAttacklevels can equip the axes that match the respective metals, but having an axe equipped is not necessary in order to chop a tree; having one in the player's inventory also works.
Most trees follow the same mechanics when cut, rolling to chop a log every 4 gameticks. All trees have different chances to chop a log depending on the tree being cut, the player's Woodcutting level, and the axe being used. With a high Woodcutting level and a good axe, a 100% success rate can be achieved when cutting certain lower-level trees.[2]
Trees despawn on a timer that activates after the first cut and regenerates if players stop cutting the tree before it is fully chopped. The regeneration rate is equal to the chopping time. So chopping for 10 seconds, then stopping for 10 seconds will let the tree recover to full. After a tree depletes, a timer counts down to its respawn.
Members have a chance to receive thebeaverWoodcutting pet whilst chopping trees aroundGielinor.
Whilst chopping most standard trees, players have a 1/256 chance to receivebird nests, which fall to the floor and can be picked up. These may be empty, or contain various rings, tree seeds, and rarely abird's egg. The nests themselves are valuable in theircrushed formfor use in makingSaradomin Brewswith theHerbloreskill.
The player may also obtainclue nestsin a similar fashion, which contain aclue scrollbetween beginner and elite tiers. Whilst regular bird nests aren't obtainable through chopping redwood trees, clue nests are. Unlike normal nests, these rates are affected by the type of tree and Woodcutting level.
Several locations have unique mechanics that related to Woodcutting.
TheWoodcutting guildis located in the south-western corner ofHosidius, providing various Woodcutting features formembers. The guild requires at least level 60 Woodcutting to enter. Within the guild, players receive aninvisible +7 boostto their Woodcutting skill, allowing them to chop trees significantly faster, but not trees that require a Woodcutting level above their visible level.
The guild contains a wide variety of trees found acrossGielinor, including higher levelyewandmagic trees; all found in close proximity to both asawmillandbank. It is the only location ofredwood treesin the game, except for those grown by the player within theFarming guild. Other notable features include:
Forestryis a social Woodcutting activity in which players carry aForestry kitfor a chance to spawn special events upon felling trees. These special events can spawn more frequently when players are either cutting the same tree, cutting higher-tiered trees, or by doing both. Eligible players can earnanima-infused bark, various types ofleaves, and other rare event items. The anima-infused bark can then be exchanged atForestry shopsfor a variety of Woodcutting-related items.
(Other thanWoodcutting)
Canoesare a way of travelling along theRiver Lum. All that is required to use them is anaxeand a minimum of level 12 Woodcutting for the lowest level canoe. There are five canoe stations and six stops.
Canoes are a very handy way of getting toEdgevillewithout anamulet of glory.
Whilst theWildernessis the last stop, there are no suitable trees to make a canoe, so it is a one-way trip. It drops players off just north of theblack chinchompahunting grounds.
Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup is a Woodcutting minigame that revolves around hacking jungle bushes aroundTai Bwo Wannaiwith a machete forthatch sparsand using them to repair the village fence. Both actions grant favour with the locals, which can be exchanged fortrading sticks. Furthermore,gout tubers,proboscides,snake hide,uncut opals,uncut jades,uncut red topazesandtribal masksmay be obtained from creatures and rocks that occasionally spawn upon successfully clearing a jungle bush.
Theregular trees,teak tree,mahogany trees,yew treesandmagic treesfound within the walls of Prifddinas have a 1/40 chance of producing acrystal shardin addition to the main product. Despite their models also having embedded crystals, the trees inGwenithdo not yield crystal shards.
Ents are monsters found in theWildernessand at theWoodcutting guild. They become ent trunks when killed, which can be chopped for randomnotedlogs until it despawns. Ents in the wilderness produce logs at twice the rate of logs from ents at the Woodcutting Guild. Completing the medium tier of theWilderness Diaryfurther increases the rate.
Oak trees, willow trees, maple trees, yew trees, and magic trees can be planted in any of sixtree patchesfound throughout Gielinor. Teak trees and mahogany trees can be planted in any of threehardwood patchesonFossil Island.Crystal treescan be planted in thecrystal tree patchinPrifddinas.Celastrus treescan be planted in the dedicatedcelastrus patchand redwood trees in the dedicatedredwood tree patch, both found in the advanced tier of theFarming Guild. Crystal trees and celastrus do not grant Woodcutting experience when chopped.
Farmable trees offer the benefit of being visible only to the player who has planted it, thus removing competition. Attempting to chop a tree in a Farming patch causes the player to stall for onetick, which allows for1.5-tick woodcutting.
Several obstacles can be traversed by chopping them with an axe or machete. These include:
Thebeaveris a skillingpetthat can be obtained whilst training Woodcutting. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Woodcutting level and the time it takes to gather a resource. Choppingenttrunks andbruma rootswill notgive players a chance to receive this pet.

Upon completing any of the following quests, players may choose to allocate experience to Woodcutting. These rewards usually come in the form of items, such as lamps or books, and are independent of any experience rewards directly received for completing the quest.
The chance of receivingcrystal shardsobtained from cutting non-regular trees inPrifddinashas increased from 1/80 to 1/40.
Level up messages relating to the canoes no longer reference them being members content as they are available in F2P.
Canoes are now listed correctly as F2P content in the Woodcutting skillguide.
