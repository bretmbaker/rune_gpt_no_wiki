[Page: Adventure Paths]

Adventure Pathsare a task system intended to help new players get on their feet by completing tasks for various low level rewards. Players will only be eligible for Adventure Paths if they've told theGielinor Guideat the very beginning ofTutorial Islandthat they are either a new player or are a player that has played in the past, but not recently. In addition, players who choose to playIronman Modeare not eligible.
The task system currently has two paths available at the same time: the Combat Path, with a total of 15 tasks, and the Gatherer Path, with three tasks (one per skill).
Alternatively, some players may be given a tasks system with three paths available instead of the Combat Path: the Warrior Path, the Wizard Path, and the Ranger Path. Each alternate path has three tasks.
After completing any task, players may claim a reward fromAdventurer Jon, with most tasks giving an additional reward if claimed onmembersworlds. If one claims some rewards then later becomes a member, they may then claim any members-only rewards they previously missed out on.
