Foodis a type ofitemprimarily used to restore the player'sHitpoints, though some foods may have other effects. Food can be obtained through theCookingskill, as a drop from certainmonsters, from somerandom eventssuch as theSandwich ladyrandom event, from other players, or fromnon-player characters. There are also foods which can be grown with theFarmingskill or found in some farm areas such aspotatoes,cabbages, andonions. Lastly, there areholidayfood items such aspumpkinsandeaster eggs. It is not advised to eat one of these holiday items due to their low availability and high price.
There are many different kinds of food, such asfishandmeat,bread,cakes,pies, andpizza. Some foods, such as pies and pizzas, have two or more "bites" or "slices" meaning they can be eaten multiple times.
Most food will delay your next attack or food consumption by 3ticks(1.8 seconds) when consumed. Foods which incur non-standard attack or eating delays are calledfast foods.
These are some of the most popular foods. You can find a list of all foodshere, and a list of all cooked foods under theCookingskill.

Fast foods refer to a subtype of food that incur non-standard attack or eating delays when they are consumed. This means you may be able to eat them faster, or attack more quickly after eating one than you could with other foods.
Combo eating is a strategy that allows the healing effect from multiple foods to apply in a single server tick. The most common example involves eating aKarambwandirectly after eating another non-combo food. This consumes both foods and applies healing instantly.
Hunter meats, when eaten, will heal an initial amount before doing so again after 7 ticks (4.2 seconds), making it heal more Hitpoints overall than other foods in its level bracket. If a second meat is eaten before the effect happens, only the most recent secondary heal will occur. The secondary effect will not be cancelled when eating other foods such ascooked karambwans, however.
By default, players with the appropriateCookinglevel can cook low tier hunter meat, but better quality meats require having completed a set amount ofHunters' Rumoursbefore being able to cook them.
These foods can be more useful than the more commonly used foods, but will usually only see use in more niche scenarios due to their high cost, low trade volume, difficulty to obtain, or limited use cases. Some uses would include speed, endurance, or low-level challenges for various bosses, supplementing other food as a means to perform specific strategies, orIronmenwho do not wish to train Cooking very high.
When selecting the right food for your next venture, two things should be thought about.
