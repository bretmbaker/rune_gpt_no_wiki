[Page: Smithing]

Smithingis a productionskillthrough which players create a wide variety of metal items fromoreand metalbars. It is the companion skill ofMining, which generates raw materials used in Smithing. Ores acquired from Mining are smelted into metal bars atfurnaces, and thenhammeredintoitemsatanvils. Many smithable items are useful incombat,quests, and the training of a number of other skills such asCraftingandFletching.
Smelting is the process of extracting a metalbarfrom a metalore. To obtain a metal bar, a player must use an ore of the desired metal with afurnace. Some metals require multiple ores, and some requirecoalto be added to the furnace to raise the furnace's temperature.
Metal bars can be smelted by either using ores directly on a furnace or by clicking on the furnace, right-clicking on the desired bar to smelt, and selecting the number of bars to smelt.
Memberscan also smelt bars at theBlast Furnace, which can be a quicker and more cost-effective alternative to usual smelting at a furnace.
With level 43Magic, players can smeltbarsusing theSuperheat Itemspell. Doing so grants the same amount of Smithingexperienceas smelting using a furnace, and has a few advantages:
All metals have a 100% success rate with the exception ofiron ore, which has a 50% chance of success, regardless of level; however, wearing aring of forging, using theSuperheat Itemspell, or using theBlast Furnaceprovides a 100% success rate for smithingiron bars. A failed smelting attempt results in the loss of the iron ore.
Smithing is the process by which players craft ametalitem out of one or more metalbars. Smithing is always done at ananvil, using ahammeror animcando hammer. When a player clicks on an anvil or uses a metal bar with one, an overlay is shown in which the player selects which item to forge. The player can either click the item to smith one such item, or right-click on the item and select a higher quantity of items to smith. Smithing takes place at a time interval of 5ticks(roughly 3 seconds) per item created, regardless of the items being created or how many bars are being used per item.  Each piece of theSmiths' Uniformgives a 20% chance to speed up actions performed at an anvil by 1 tick (from 5 to 4), up to a 100% chance with the full set.
Different Smithing levels are required to make different items. Below is a table with information about Smithing and what players can create. It is important to note thatblack armour and weaponscannotbe smithed.
Smithing experience is calculated by taking the experience granted from 1 bar and multiplying it by the number of bars used. For example, abronze platebodyis 62.5 experience using 5 bars. 1 bar is 12.5 exp, so go 5 * 12.5 = 62.5. This works for all bars and all smithing items, with a few exceptions such ascannonballs.
TheBlast Furnaceis a special furnace that takes half the usual amount ofcoalto smelt bars, and processes all loaded ore at once instead of one by one. Other players must be operating and repairing various parts of the furnace in order to power it, but on designated blast furnaceworlds, there are non-players characters who perform this action in exchange for payment.
TheGiants' Foundryis an activity in which players take commissions to smith giant swords from bars or recycled metal items. These swords must be hammered, ground and polished at precise temperatures, which can be controlled by dipping it in water or lava. The player is rewarded with smithing experience,coinsandFoundry Reputation.
Theblacksmith's helmdoes not play any role in smithing.Weight-reducing clothingis useful for some smithing activities. Mining rocks with aninfernal pickaxegives a 1/3 chance to combust the ore, granting smithing experience.
Smithing offers several opportunities to make money. Players have the option to castHigh Level Alchemyon the items they made with smithing, sell them to specialtygeneral stores, or sell them on theGrand Exchange. Furthermore, members have the ability to smelt metalbarsat theBlast Furnacefor lowered ore costs and therefore greater profits.
Smithing in conjunction with casting High Level Alchemy is responsible for bringing significant amount of coins into the game. At aMagiclevel of 55, a player can "high alch" items using 5fire runesand 1nature runeto turn items into coins. Several items made by Smithing can be profitable whenHigh Alchemyis cast on them. Some high alchemy values are found in the table below.
Specialty stores are general stores that purchase items from the player for more coins than most general stores. TheJiminua's Jungle Storenorth ofTai Bwo Wannaivillage onKaramjawith theKaramja gloves3/4purchases items at above the high alchemy value.
Other stores include: the general store run byMartin Thwaitin theRogues' Den(Martin Thwait's Lost and Found), theWest Ardougne General Store, and theBandit Duty Freein theBandit Campin theWilderness(although this one isNOTrecommended due to its dangerous location). Keep in mind that the buy price at general stores decreases rapidly the more items it has in stock, so it's recommended to hop around frequently if you decide to sell your items.
Other ways for making money include at level 40 Smithing with level 6Craftingand anecklace mould,gold necklacecan be made at the same furnace in whichgold oreis smelted intogold bars.Grum's Gold ExchangeinPort Sarimbuys a gold necklace for 315 coins if his stock is zero; the price decreases 9 coins for each gold necklace in stock, dropping to 45 coins at a stock of 30 or more
The items listed below are the ones most players use inHigh Level Alchemy. A more comprehensive list for steel through rune items with updated profit margins can be found here:Calculator:Magic/High alchemy.
Upon completing any of the following quests, players may choose to allocate experience to Smithing. These rewards usually come in the form of items, such as lamps or books, and are independent of any experience rewards directly received for completing the quest.
The Smithing interface now remembers the last item crafted, outlined with a highlight, and can be selected with space bar if all the required materials are current held. Without the correct items, Smithing via spacebar will be disabled and the highlight will be removed.
A Left-click 'Smith' option has been added to anvils.
The Smithing menu now offers a Make-X option.
