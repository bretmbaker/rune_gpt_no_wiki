[Page: Ladder]

Laddersare used to go up and down to the next or previous level of theRuneScapegame. This is a very common piece of scenery found throughout RuneScape. They come in many varieties: ghostly (such as the one at the entrance toDamis' Lair), broken, and regular (commonly found throughout Gielinor). Users cannot ascend or descend 'broken' ladders.
