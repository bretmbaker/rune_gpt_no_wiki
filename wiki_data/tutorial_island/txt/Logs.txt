[Page: Logs]

Logs, also callednormal logs, are obtained fromcuttingregular,evergreen,jungle,dyinganddead trees. Players can burn these logs using theFiremakingskill. Cutting the logs gives 25Woodcuttingexperience, and burning them with atinderboxgives 40 Firemaking experience. Burning them at aforester's campfiregives 13.3 Firemaking experience. These logs have no requirement to be cut or burnt.
MemberstrainingConstructioncan bring logs to asawmillto makeplanksat a cost of 100coinseach. Alternatively, theLunar spellPlank Makecan allow players to convert them to planks at a lower cost, but at the expense ofrunes.
While wearingKandarin headgear 1or higher, normal trees anywhere give double logs when chopped down but no additional experience is provided.
Members can also combine logs with fire lighters to create various coloured logs. The table below shows what firelighters can be combined with regular logs. The logs can be burnt for 50 Firemaking experience each.
Four normal logs respawn onLumbridge Castle's roof, in a house inDraynor Village, in theWizards' Tower, and in a house inRimmington.
Memberscan alsofletchthese logs intobowsandarrow shafts. It is currently the only log which can be used withgnomish firelighters, which are obtained as rewards fromTreasure Trails. These firelighters produce fire in one of five predetermined colours: red, blue, green, purple, or white, and also give slightly more Firemaking experience than lighting the logs normally.
Normal logs are also used to travel toEntranaorTaverleyusing theBalloon Transport Systemafter completing theEnlightened Journeyquest (they are also required during the quest).

The player gains 20 Firemaking experience when cutting trees, half the experience gained from burning the log normally.
