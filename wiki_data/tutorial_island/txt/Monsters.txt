[Page: Monster]

Monsteris the official term for anattackablecharacter or being that is notplayer-controlled. A monster can range from a not-so-harmfulRatto the extremely strongChaos Elemental. Monsters are often fought by players fortraining, entertainment, andloot.Killing monstersis one of the most popular activities inOld School RuneScape. Nearly all monsters dropremains.
While some monsters will never begin a fight with a player, many high level creatures areaggressive, potentially causing unwanted death. If a player has over double thecombat levelof the monster, the monster will be docile, and will only attack when provoked. However, in areas such as theWilderness, most monsters are indefinitely aggressive. As a rule of thumb, "humanoids" are not aggressive towards players except in some cases when the humanoid's nature or occupation has malign or criminal connotations (i.e.Black Knight,Zombie,Mugger). Most cities are also safe from aggressive monsters, though the perimeter or surroundings may not be as secure.
