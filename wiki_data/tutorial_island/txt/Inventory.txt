[Page: Inventory]

A player'sinventoryis a term for all of theitemsthey are carrying. The gameinterfacesplits the inventory into two sections: the backpack inventory and the equipped inventory.
The backpack inventory is where the player carries items that can't be or aren't equipped. A player's backpack inventory can hold up to 28 items, and any additional items must be stored in the player'sbank. Some items arestackable(such ascoins,runes, andarrows), which means they only take up the space of one item, no matter how many a player has.
The limit of 28 items in a player's inventory is integral to theRuneScapeeconomy. Since only 28 items can be held at once, this requires players to make trips tobanksto deposit items while they are gathering or making items. This adds time to the process of gathering items such aslogs,ores, orflaxand the process of making items, such asbowstrings,bars, andbows. If inventory was unlimited, the prices of such items could face a considerable drop because it wouldn't take as much time to obtain large amounts of them.Runecraftwould be made ridiculously easy, as players would be able to craft infinite amounts ofrunesin a single trip. Gatheringskills, such asFishing,Woodcutting, andMining(particularly miningrune/pure essence) could be trained for infinite amounts of time without much movement, and processing skills, such asSmithing,Cooking, andFletchingwould be extremely easy because infinite numbers of materials could be processed into finished items in one trip. The limitations of inventory help to stabilise theRuneScapeeconomy.
