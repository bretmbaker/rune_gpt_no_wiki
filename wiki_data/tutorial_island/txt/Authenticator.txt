    Authenticator]

TheRuneScapeAuthenticatoris an additional layer of protection players can utilise on theiraccounts. It replaces theJagex Account Guardian(JAG), by using anRFC-complianttime-based one-time password (TOTP) compatible withGoogle Authenticator. This algorithm can be used both on supported mobile devices and in desktop implementations. This system works for bothOld School RuneScapeandRuneScape 3, unlike the JAG did previously.
Besides having an extra 20 bank spaces available when active, players are required to set up the Authenticator in order to be able to receive a pair offancyandfighting bootsin theStronghold of Security, as well as a pair offancier bootsif the player also has aJagex Account. In addition, having it set up is required forSolztunto imbue the player'sskull sceptre. Should players disable the Authenticator, the skull sceptre will revert to its regular state.
To set up theRuneScapeAuthenticator, a player must visit theAuthenticator landing page.Jagexgenerates a random 80-bit secret key unique to each user and presents it as aQR codeand as a 16-characterBase32string. Many mobile devices can read the QR code directly through their camera, which is equivalent to entering the Base32 string manually. The implementation generates a 6-digit code every 30 seconds based on the key andepoch time.
Once set up, players are prompted to enter the 6-digit time-based code whenever they log in to the game using an untrusted computer. Jagex implements a 10-minute window (five minutes on either side of the actual time) to enter the correct code to allow for a possible lack of synchronisation between Jagex's server time and player devices.
Players can choose to trust the computers on which they playRuneScapefor up to 30 days or choose to enter a code every time they wish to play.
Players can also choose to use the Authenticator for theirbank PINinstead of the fixed 4-digit PIN. However, the 4-digit PIN is not obsolete. Logging into thebankor theGrand Exchangefrom theRuneScape Companionapp still requires the 4-digit PIN. Players who choose to stop using the authenticator as the bank PIN revert to the last 4-digit PIN used.
To disable the authenticator, click on the "disable authenticator" link. Jagex sends an email containing a link to disable the authenticator to the email address registered for that account. It is highly encouraged that the email associated with the account require two-step authentication so that theRuneScapeauthenticator can not be easily removed. That is, it is suggested that the email be tied to a mobile device either by texting or a call before a new computer can gain access to said email.
Players who have purchased new devices will have to re-download the app on their devices, disable the Authenticator via theRuneScapemainpage, and re-enable it. AfterJagexhas sent the email containing a link to disable it, players will have to follow the aforementioned steps to set up the Authenticator on their new devices.
Players who cannot scan the setup QR code, or just want an alternative may use Authy.
Authy is an app trusted by Jagex that has the same basic functionality as other applications like Google Authenticator, allowing for an extra layer of account security.
You can read about Authy on thesupportsection of the officialRuneScapesite.
The main advantage of using Authy is that you can easily log back into the app, continue receiving codes, retain the extra security, and not worry about if you get a new phone or mobile number, which doesn't risk problems logging back intoRuneScapeor require the need for Account support, like it could when using Google Authenticator.
