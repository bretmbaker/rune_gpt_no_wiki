Fishingis askillwhich involves catchingfishfrom selectedspotsaroundGielinor. Higher Fishing levels enable different mechanisms of Fishing, the ability to catch a larger selection of fish and increases a player's catch rate. Caught fish may be cooked through theCookingskill to createfoodwhich may be used later to regainhitpointsduringcombat. Alternatively, many players sell their excess stock of catches forgold.
When caught, mostfishwill be raw and cannot be eaten until they arecooked. The name and colour indicates this. For example, whenshrimpsare first caught they are named "raw shrimps", but once cooked the name changes to "shrimps".
While fishing, players may also occasionally receiveclue bottlesthat contains aclue scrollof the following difficulties:beginner,easy,medium,hard, andelite.Master clue scrollscannot be obtained from clue bottles.
Players need the right kind of equipment to catch thefishthey want. Basic Fishing equipment can be purchased infishing shops. Players can buy fishing equipment from the fishing store inPort Sarimand from the fishing store inCatherby. More advanced fishing methods may need to be found or crafted.
Locations offishing shopswhere players can buy supplies are:
The first few fish players can catch require nets. Players can usesmall fishing netsandbig fishing nets. The big nets only allow players to catch different types of fish and sometimes items, such ascaskets. When a player has found afishing spot, they can then use their net if the option "net fishing spot" is available. "Net fishing spot" can be found in:Draynor Village,Lumbridge Swamp,Musa Point, the coastline nearRimmington, theWilderness Bandit Camp,Al Kharid, andCorsair Cove. A "cast fishing spot" is available at the park inCivitas illa Fortis. House keys, gems,key halves, and clue bottles, can be obtained from this spot.
Fishing rodsare required for mid level Fishing in both rivers and seas. Along with a Fishing rod, players also needbait. Bait can be bought in stores (3coinseach at thePort Sarimfishing shop), but is also dropped by somemonstersandrandom events. When a player has found afishing spot, they can then use their fishing rod if the option "bait fishing spot" is available. For everyfishyou catch, you lose one piece of bait.
Theoily fishing rodis amembersonly item required to catchinfernal eelswhen used withice glovesand to catchlava eelsfor theHeroes' Quest. The pearl variants such as thePearl fishing rodare cosmetic and not improvements over the basic fishing rod, although they can be equipped which frees up a single inventory slot.
Fly fishing rodsare also required for mid level Fishing. These rods can only be used in rivers. Along with a fly fishing rod, players also needfeathers. They can be bought from theShilo VillageandPort Sarimfishing shop, but are also dropped bychickens. When a player has found afishing spot, they can then use their fly fishing rod if the option "lure fishing spot" is available.
Stripy feathers(introduced with theHunterskill) can be used for fly fishing, as well. Those feathers work the same as normal feathers, but players will only be able to fishrainbow fish, rather than the usualtroutandsalmon. ThePearl fly fishing rodis cosmetic and not an improvement over the basic fly fishing rod, although it can be equipped which frees up a single inventory slot.
Harpoonsare required for mid and high levelfish. Harpoons can only be used in the seas. When a player has found afishing spot, they can then use their harpoon if the option "harpoon fishing spot" is available.Swordfishandtunaare caught in cage/harpoon fishing spots, whilesharksare caught in net/harpoon spots.
There are five types of harpoons - the regular harpoon, thebarb-tail harpoon, thedragon harpoon, theinfernal harpoon, and thecrystal harpoon. The dragon harpoon and infernal harpoon both have a 20% faster catch rate than the regular harpoon, and the crystal harpoon has a 35% faster catch rate. The barb-tail harpoon, dragon harpoon, infernal harpoon, and crystal harpoon can all be wielded. Many players prefer these harpoons as it saves aninventoryspace.
After being taught byOtto Godblessed, a player can catch fish that are harpoonable with just their hands. The Fishing level requirement is 20 levels higher and it also requires aStrengthlevel equal to the Fishing level needed to catch the fish normally, but a small amount of strength experience is gained and the player doesn't need a harpoon equipped or in their inventory.
Lobstersare caught in the sea by usinglobster pots. When a player has found afishing spot, they can then use their lobster pot if the option "cage fishing spot" is available. This is also true forDark Crabs, with the only difference beingDark Fishing Baitmust also be in a player's inventory.
Aerial fishingis a ranged fishing technique at the centre ofLake Molchrequiring 35Hunterand 43Fishing. Players are given aCormorant's glovefor free by talking toAlry the Angler.

These are equipable versions of common fishing equipment for additional inventory capacity. Although pearls can also purchase parts of theAngler's outfit, it's a much slower method than the recommendedFishing trawlerminigame.
Drift net fishingis a special fishing method that requires 44Hunterand 47Fishingaccessible after completingBone Voyage. Unlike fishing from a spot on the surface, this occurs in theUnderwaterarea ofFossil Islandwherefish shoalsare chased intoDrift netsset by the player beforehand.

Using this method requires a higher Fishing level as well as a Strength level equivalent to the Fishing level needed to catch the fish normally. However, it provides small amounts of Strength experience. At level 55, players can expect rates of 10,000 Fishing experience per hour, steadily increasing to 13,000 experience per hour at level 69. At level 70, catching both tuna and swordfish nets roughly 24,000 Fishing experience per hour.
Starting at level 48, the player can learn how to do heavy rod fishing; this method requires abarbarian rod(found under Otto's bed) and any type of bait (except forstripy/coloured feathers), as well as aknifeto gut the fish. In order to catch the special fish in Otto's lake or atMount Quidamortem, aStrengthandAgilitylevel is needed in addition to the fishing requirement. Theleaping fishobtained can be used with a knife to obtainroeandcaviarfor use in theHerbloreskill, and catching them gives small amounts ofexperiencein Strength and Agility. ThePearl barbarian rodis cosmetic and not an improvement over the basic Barbarian rod, although it can be equipped which frees up a single inventory slot.
Rada's blessing will give you an extra chance at catching a fish, with no additional experienced granted, starting at 2% for theRada's blessing 1to 8% with theRada's blessing 4.
Spirit flakes give a 50% chance of yielding double catch everywhere excludingTemporossand theRuins of Camdozaal, at the cost of one flake per fish caught (no additional XP is given). This stacks with Rada's blessing.

Players may fish at various fishing spots located aroundGielinor, while fishing, the location of afishing spotmay move from one spot to another within the same area, requiring the player to move to continue. The only exceptions to this are select fishing spots located within the wilderness, a single fly fishing spot just south-east of Prifddinas, and Karambwan fishing spots.
These generally are one specific place for one specific type of fishing.
Due to engine features some locations end up with fishing spots that cannot move or move at reduced rates compared to other locations. This can be desirable for AFK / minimal effort fishing.

Upon completing any of the following quests, players may choose to allocate experience to Fishing. These rewards usually come in the form of items, such as lamps or books, and are independent of any experience rewards directly received for completing the quest.
Players can no longer be dragged randomly if they spam click a Fishing spot before it moves.
The in-game skill guide has been reorganised; the "Catches" tab was split apart to specific types of fishing, ex. "Big Net", "Rod", "Aerial", etc.
You can now catch fish with a full inventory if one inventory space would become available from the bait consumed.
You no longer encounter the river troll, big fish, and whirlpool random events while fishing.
