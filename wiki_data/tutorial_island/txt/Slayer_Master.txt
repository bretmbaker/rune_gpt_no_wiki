[Page: Slayer Master]

Slayer Mastersare NPCs who serve as guides to theSlayerskill and assign tasks to players requiring them to kill specific monsters a certain number of times. Each Slayer Master has a different combat level requirement for players to be assigned tasks from them. Slayer Masters with higher combat level requirements will generally assign longer tasks with more difficult monsters. Players receiveSlayer reward pointsupon completingtaskswith bonus points being awarded at regular intervals (except for tasks fromTuraelandSpria). These points can be redeemed for a variety of different rewards, unlocks, and upgrades which enhance a player's Slayer experience.
All Slayer Masters sellSlayer equipmentat anequipment shop. These items are helpful and sometimes essential to specific Slayer tasks. They also providerewardsin exchange for Slayer points.
Turaelgives the easiest Slayer tasks and is ideal for lower level players. They have no minimum combat or Slayer level requirements before players may receive assignments. After the events ofWhile Guthix Sleeps,Ayareplaces Turael as the Slayer Master.
If a player of any level receives an assignment they do not wish to do, Turael may consider giving players an easier assignment if they talk to him effectively "skipping" the hardest assignment. However, this only works if the assignment is something that he doesn't assign. For example, if Chaeldar assigns a playerDesert Lizards, then the Burthorpe Slayer Master cannot change their task, as he too assigns Desert Lizards.  Note that it is impossible for a player to get Turael to reassign a task that he gave out.
He is located in a small house south of thegeneral storeinBurthorpe. The fastest ways to reach him are to use:
Completion of a task assigned by Turaelwill notgrant any Slayer points. As well, if it was a task replacing one from another Master yourtask streakwill bereset. So, if you're on the 48th task and take a replacement one from Turael, your completed tasks will be set to 0.

Krystilia's tasks come with a risk: tasks assigned by hermustbe done within theWilderness. She has no minimum combat or Slayer level requirements, and doesn't factor in the player's combat level, meaning she may give players tasks much harder than their combat level would otherwise indicate.
While completing Krystilia's tasks, players may obtainLarran's keys, the drop rate of which is dependent on the monster's combat level. They can be used to open asmallorbig chestfor additional rewards.
Assignments from her have a separate task completion counter than assignments from other Slayer Masters, so players will have to complete five of her Slayer assignments to begin earning Slayer reward points. If the player chooses to reset an assignment Krystilia gives before the five assignments are completed, the counter will reset to zero and the player will need to complete five more tasks before they will receive reward points.
She can be found by the jailhouse inEdgeville, north-east of the bank. The fastest ways to reach her are to use:

Konar is unique amongst the primary Slayer Masters in the fact that in addition to assigning a monster, she will also assign one of multiple locations (if the monster can be found in other places). She will never direct players into the Wilderness, unless it is part of boss Slayer, as that is Krystilia's assignment location.
While completing Konar's tasks, players may obtain abrimstone key, which have drop rates similar toLarran's keys. They can be used to open thebrimstone chestnear her for additional rewards.
