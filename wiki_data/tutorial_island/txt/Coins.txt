[Page: Coins]

Coins(also referred to asgold pieces,gp,gold, or simplymoney) are the most common form ofcurrencyinGielinor. They are used among players andnon-player charactersalike to exchange for items and services.
Players often refer to one thousand (1,000) coins as1kand one million (1,000,000) coins as1mor1mil. Both can be applied to larger numbers, for example,10mrefers to ten million coins (10,000,000).1bor1bilrefers to one billion coins (1,000,000,000).
Alchemy spells, which create coins, cannot be cast on coins. If a player attempts it, a message will inform the player thatCoins are already made of gold.Curiously, other items made of gold, such asgold oreandgold bars, can be turned into coins with Alchemy spells.
Wearing aRing of Wealthwill automatically pick up coins dropped by NPCs upon killing them as long as the player has inventory space available.
Players can askAnjainRimmingtonfor some free stuff, and after the dialogue she will give 1 to 3 coins.
Alternate terms for coins have seldom seen official usage sinceRuneScape Classicwas replaced byRuneScape 2. Very fewNPCsuse any other term than "coins," a few examples being theBlast Furnace foremaninKeldagrim, who calls them "GP" as he prefers to associate coins with the metal at the expense of proper terminology, and the glassblower onEntrana, who calls them "gold pieces." The term "gp" is sometimes used in abbreviations such as on the right-click menu of theAl Kharidgates, which includes the option "Pay-toll(10gp)" to pay the toll and go through.
Some players purchase coins in exchange for real-world money through a third party. This is known asreal world trading. Although players can potentially gain monetary value withinRuneScapeby such means, this method isnotrecommended, as Rule #12 of theRuneScapeCode of Conduct forbids the trading ofRuneScapeitems for items outside ofRuneScape, and if engaged in can result in a playerban.
With the release ofOld school bonds, however, players may legally acquireRuneScapecoins using real-world money, albeit indirectly, by buying bonds fromJagexand selling them in-game to other players or on theGrand Exchange.
