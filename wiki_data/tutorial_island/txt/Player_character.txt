[Page: Player character]

ThePlayer, also known as theAdventurer, is the avatar of someone playingOld School RuneScape. The Player is ahuman, may be eitherbody typeand may be freely customised. Their adventuring career begins in the year 169 of theFifth AgeonTutorial Island, and thereafter involves a number ofquestsuntil they become a well-known hero.
As stated in the bookMy life, the Adventurer was born in theFifth Ageto simple beginnings, with very little money to their name and nothing but a dream of adventure. According toSir Renitee, the chief herald ofFalador, the Player's family hails from eitherMisthalin,Kandarin, orAsgarnia; their family has no known noble blood, and thus no inherited heraldry, though they are permitted by Sir Renitee to use the crest of their family's place of origin as their own. The Adventurer's family is rarely mentioned, though a few references have been made to a brother,[1]a grandmother,[2]and an aunt.[3]
I've never really been one for looking backwards. I prefer to look ahead.
In the year 169 of theFifth Age, the Adventurer made their way toTutorial Island, where they first learned the basics ofcombat,skills,questingand systems such as thebank.
The Adventurer then left the island and began training their skills and performing a number of quests for people. Starting out with simple tasks such asshearing sheepand helping thecookofLumbridge Castleprepare a cake, they eventually went on to perform more impressive feats, likeslaying the demonDelrithandassisting in rediscoveringthe incantation to theRune Essence Mine. As their adventures continued, their achievements amassed and became ever more gallant, includingslaying the dragonElvarg, becoming aTemple Knightandstopping major threats,brokering peacebetween multipleFremenniktribes and earning thehonorific title'Dr√§pare', aiding theMyrequeinliberatingMorytaniafrom the rule of thevampyres, leading anuprisinginArdougneand restoring the city ofPrifddinas, thwartinggnomishplans to invade human territories, preventing thedragonkinfromdestroying humanity, and much more.
The Player became a member of theChampions',Heroes',Legends'andMyths' Guild. Additionally, afterresolving a disputebetween two warring islands, they succeededKing Vargaswho appointed them as regent of the island ofMiscellania, becoming engaged to, or the best friend of, eitherPrince BrandorPrincess Astridin the process.
They have had a number of mentors in their adventuring career, most notably theWise Old Man.
Throughout their travels, the Adventurer encountered a race known as theMahjarrat: long-lived beings who ritually sacrifice one of their own kind every 500 years in order to rejuvenate the rest. Continuing to meddle in Mahjarrat affairs, they engaged in conflicts with theZamorakianEnakhra,General Khazard, (possibly)Hazeel, andLucien, but assisted a handful of Mahjarrat loyal to the mysterious godZaros, includingAkthanakosandAzzanadra.
The Player has also encountered manygodsand godlike beings, fromAmascutandIcthlarinto theFragment of Seren, powerful spirits such as thethree water spiritsofElidinisandFossegrimen, theguardianJuna, survivingarmy membersof theGod Warsandgod-aligned followers, plus innumerable other ancient creatures and fearsome monsters. It would appear that the Player is canonically a follower ofGuthixbased on some in-game dialogue.[5][6]
Overall, the Player's actions vary in their scope and gravity, ranging from helping amisguided trolllearn to farmorretrieving a boy's ballto saving the world several times over, but the Player is generally altruistic anddeterminedin accomplishing their goals.
