[Page: Items]

InOld School RuneScape,itemsare physical objects that a player may have in theirinventoryorbank. Players distinguish them by their names and graphics. The game additionally seems to distinguish items byID numbersthat are not visible to players in-game.
Items can be described by a number of characteristics:
Not every item inOld School RuneScapeistradeable, and of the items that are, not all can be listed for sale on theGrand Exchange. All items could be traded whenRuneScapewas first released, until a2002 updateintroduced the concept of untradeable items by barring players from trading certain quest items.
As a rule, tradeable items can be:
These properties do not apply to all tradeable items however, as amembership bondfor instance cannot be alchemised, despite being a tradeable item. They are also not exclusive to tradeable items; untradeable items may or may not be alchemiseable. In general, most tradeable items can also be listed for sale on the Grand Exchange. Numerous exceptions do exist, which are listed onGrand Exchange/Non-tradeable items.
Free-to-playaccounts cannot trademembers-only items with other players or sell them to shops, even if they are tradeable. Members' items can however be sold on the Grand Exchange, regardless of membership status or world type.
A large number of items may be dropped on the ground through the right-click "Drop" option. How an item behaves once it is dropped depends on whether it is tradeable or untradeable. Tradeable items will become visible to other players one minute after being dropped to the ground, and disappear altogether after three minutes. This timer will keep ticking down if the player who dropped the item logs out, and will always stay on the same world it is dropped in. Dropped untradeable items however will not appear to other players, though they also despawn after three minutes. In contrast to tradeable items, untradeables are tied to the player who dropped them, and will appear in any world that player switches to. The despawn timer of these items is also paused while the player is logged out.
That said, dropped item behaviour can diverge from these rules in certain circumstances. Perhaps most notably, nearly all items dropped in theWildernessbecome visible to other players immediately: this is to discourage players from dropping their items before dying and quickly travelling back to pick them up. The only exceptions to this are cooked foods and potions, which never appear to other players in the Wilderness, so as to prevent clans and teams from dropping supplies for each other during a fight.Chinchompasalso cannot be released in combat in the Wilderness, to prevent chinchompa hunters from releasing them out of spite and leaving nothing for the player killer. Items dropped onTutorial Islandwill disappear after only 30 seconds. Items placed on tables disappear after 10 minutes. Items dropped ininstancestend to have a much longer despawn timer, which is typically – but not always – set to three hours.[1]Clue scrollsof all tiers have a despawn timer of one hour when dropped, except when dropped in instances with increased despawn timers, where they will instead respect the despawn timer of that instance.
Players can allow potions and food items to form a supply pile on death by enabling the corresponding option in theSettings panel, which will cause these items to persist across worlds and suspend their despawn timer on logout as though they were untradeable.
There is a limit on the total number of items or item stacks that can remain on the ground within the same 8x8 tiles game chunk.[2]If more than 129 tradeable items are dropped within that area, additional ones will begin to replace items already lying on the ground.[3]The order of priority is determined by theGrand Exchange guide valueof the various items, which the lowest priced items being replaced first.[4]For item stacks, the value of the whole stack is taken into account when determining its priority.[5]Untradeable items and items that are part of a supply pile do not count towards this limit.
Some items have a "Destroy" option instead of a "Drop" option as part of their right-click interface, as is commonly the case forquest items,event rewards, and untradeable items in general. Destroying an item will make it vanish instantly, rather than first being cast to the ground. A chatbox message appears in most cases when the "Destroy" option is selected, prompting the player for confirmation, coupled with a short description of whether and how it may be reobtained.
Unlike in its parent gameRuneScape, the team ofOld School RuneScapehave taken special care to prevent discontinued items. Allholiday itemsare able to be reobtained every year at their respective holiday dates. Whenever an item is in fact discontinued, (e.g., thecabbage rune,kristmas kebab, and various other in-progress holiday event items), if the player has any of those items, they are removed from wherever they are stored.
InRuneScape, discontinued items can fetch billions ofgold pieces. Although theOld Schoolteam was at first unsure whether or not to repeat the behaviour of discontinuing holiday items and letting prices inflate, ultimately they decided, like Andrew Gower did in 2003, "players hoarding huge numbers of the gifts we drop and then reselling them for massively unfair prices [...] isn't really in the spirit of the occasion."[6]Given a fresh slate, theOld Schoolteam has been able to avoid that legacy mistake.
Historically, item names inRuneScapecould not exceed a certain amount of pixels.[7]As a result, the longest item names prior to the launch ofOld School RuneScapedid not exceed 20 characters. This limit was lifted sometime after the launch of theNightmare Zone, where the itemanti-dragon shield (nz)surpassed the limit at 23 characters. Due to anUpdateon June 1st 2023, Members' Items are now visible in Free to Play worlds with "(Members)" as a suffix, thusCorrupted morrigan's leather chaps (bh)(inactive)(Members)may take the lead. However the actual item name did not change leaving this open to interpretation.
