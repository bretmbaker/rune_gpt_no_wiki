[Weapon: 3Rd Age Plateskirt]


The3rd age plateskirtis a part of the3rd age melee set. It has the same stats as the3rd age platelegs, and also requires level 65Defenceto wear. It is tied with the aforementioned 3rd age platelegs for the third-highest defence bonuses of all non-degradable melee leg slot items, only surpassed by thejusticiar legguardsandtorva platelegs. The 3rd age plateskirt is a possible reward fromhard,eliteandmastertierTreasure Trails, and cannot be made through theSmithingskill.
It is roughly on par withbandos tassetsfor melee defence; however, 3rd age armour emphasises slash and crush defensive bonuses and lacks astrength bonus. Due to its price and lack of offensive bonuses, it is very rarely used for combat.
