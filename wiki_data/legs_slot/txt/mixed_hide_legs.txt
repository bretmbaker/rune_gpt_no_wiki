[Weapon: Mixed Hide Legs]


Mixed hide legsare part of themixed hide armourset, requiring level 60Rangedto wear. It provides bonuses that are meant to complement thehunter's spear. However, because of the added stab bonus, this item is favourable when using any stab weapon as theBandos tassetsdo not provide higher DPS than the mixed hide legs in certain scenarios; where the 2melee strengthbonus does not grant an additional maximum hit.
Players with level 71Craftingcan create the legs with amixed hide baseand threefox furs, alongside aneedleandthread. Players without the required level may instead pay 20,000coinstoPellemat theHunter Guildto make one on their behalf, whilst providing the aforementioned materials.
