The player must wear the robes in order to enter theWater Ravine Dungeonfarther north along theRiver Elid.
You can get a new set of robes by searching the cupboard again for the torn robes and then remaking them with needle and thread. You cannot get another set of torn robes if you already have a set of torn robes or robe of Elidinis in your possession (including in the bank). However, you can use theDrop trickto get extra sets by dropping your robes before searching the cupboard. This gets you a new set of torn robes, which you can mend when you wish.
