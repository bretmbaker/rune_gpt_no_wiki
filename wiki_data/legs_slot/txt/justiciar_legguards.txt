TheJusticiar legguardsis obtained as a rare drop from theTheatre of Blood. It is part of thejusticiar armourset, and requires level 75Defenceto equip.
When the full set of Justiciar armour is equipped, the player gains aset effect: all combat damage taken is reduced (except inPvP). The exact formula for the amount of damage reduced isbonus3000, where bonus is the player's defence bonus for that particular style.
