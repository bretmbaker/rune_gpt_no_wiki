Snakeskin chaps are very popular amongst low/mid-level rangers, because of their low requirements and lack of an affordable upgrade. However,studded chapsare preferred over snakeskin chaps, as studded chaps has only a 20 Ranged requirement and provides the same attack bonuses and more defensive bonuses.
