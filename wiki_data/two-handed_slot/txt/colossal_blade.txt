Thecolossal bladeis atwo-handed swordpurchased from theGiants' Foundryreward shopfor 5,000Foundry Reputation, requiring level 60Attackto wield.
The colossal blade's stats are similar to those of thebarrelchest anchor, with a slightly higherslashbonus than the anchor'scrushbonus. Although it lacks aspecial attack, it has a passive effect to make up for it on larger size monsters. The blade also has much lower requirements compared to the barrelchest anchor, which also requires 40Strength, in addition to 50Prayerand 40Rangedfor completion ofThe Great Brain Robberyquest. Due to this, the blade can be used as a substitute for the anchor on low Prayer, 60 Attack,player killingbuilds. The 15, 31, and 43 Prayer builds for example, will benefit from this.

[Passive Effect]
The colossal blade has apassive effectthat increases the wielder's maximum hit against larger enemies, calculated asMaxHit+[2Ã—min(MonsterSize,5)], meaning max hit is increased by double the monster's size value, but at most by 10 (at a monster size of 5). TheMonsterSizeis the number ofgame squareson one side of the monster's occupied space. Example:Sarachnisis a size 5x5 monster and theMonsterSizeis 5. This bonus does stack with the bonus granted by Black Mask.
