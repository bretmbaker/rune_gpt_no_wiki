The ornate handle is obtained fromJustine's Stuff for the Last Shopper Standing.
Agranite clampcan be added to the maul to adjust its appearance. The clamp gives no additional bonuses, and is only used to add aesthetics to the maul.

[Special Attack]
A player performing the granite maul's special attack,Quick Smash.
The granite maul'sspecial attack,Quick Smash, consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and deals an instant attack.
With the handle added, the special attack can result in two or three hits in a very short amount of time, making it a popular choice forplayer killing. If the three hits are timed correctly, the granite maul can kill instantly. However, one drawback is that unlike most special attacks,Quick Smashdoes not increase accuracy.
It is commonly used in theNightmare Zonein conjunction with the Power surge power-up. BecauseQuick Smashcan be performed rapidly under the effect of Power surge, the granite maul is able to put out more total damage than other special attacks for as long as the power-up is active.
The granite maul's special attack has a feature where, for 5 ticks after attacking a target with any weapon, activating the granite maul's special attack while next to that target will automatically attack it without clicking to do so. Clicking the special attack bar toggles the activation and reactivation of this feature, so clicking the special attack bar twice, for example, will disable the automatic attack.
Clicking on the special attack bar twice does not disable the granite maul special attack. Rather, it initiates a 3 tick timer during which clicking on an opponent (or clicking the special attack bar a third time while next to an opponent one has attacked within 5 ticks) will cause two special attacks to occur if possible, or one if it is not. Once it has been activated, a granite maul special attack can only be disabled by taking off the weapon, or waiting out this 3 tick timer.
The game displays a warning when the player initiates combat with a granite maul special attack, calling it wasteful. However, the special attack does not give the player any attack cooldown, regardless of if it was used to initiate combat or not. This means that initiating combat with a granite maul special attack can be quickly followed by another attack on the following tick. This a useful tactic for dealing high amounts of unexpected damage in PvP scenarios. In terms of overall damage per second, initiating combat with the special attack is one tick less efficient than using the special attack while on cooldown between normal attack cycles.
