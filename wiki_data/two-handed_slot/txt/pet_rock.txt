[Weapon: Pet Rock]


Apet rockcan be obtained fromAskeladdenduring and afterThe Fremennik Trialsquest. After the quest multiple pet rocks can be obtained by talking to him again.
Rocks can usually find their own food, and don't often need attention, so rocks are a good choice for a pet. The pet rock is held in both hands, although it cannot be used as aweapon;unarmedattacks are instead used while the pet rock is equipped. The pet rock does not confer any stat bonuses or penalties.
