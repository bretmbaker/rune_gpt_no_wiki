[Weapon: Orange Salamander]


Theorange salamanderis the fourth strongestsalamander weapon. Once theHunter creatureis caught using theHunterskill, they become weapons. The orange salamander requires level 50Ranged, 50Attack, and 50Magicto wield and is a two-handed weapon.Marrentill taris used as ammunition for the salamander.
Despite being able to perform Magic and Ranged attacks, this weapon requires the user to be in the opponent'smeleedistance to attack, potentially reducing the practicality of the two attack styles. However, it can be used to attack enemies from behind fences, and can also attack enemies in diagonal squares, meaning thatsafespottingis still possible.
