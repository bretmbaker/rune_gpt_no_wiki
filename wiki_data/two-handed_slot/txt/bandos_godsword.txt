[Special Attack]
A player usesWarstrike, the Bandos godsword's special attack.
The Bandos godsword'sspecial attack,Warstrike, has doubled accuracy, inflicts 21% more damage and drains the opponent's combat levels equivalent to the damage hit in the following order:Defence,Strength,Prayer,Attack,Magic,Ranged.Warstrikeconsumes 50% of the wielder's special attack energy.Warstrikerolls against the opponent's slash defence roll.
For example, ifWarstrikeinflicts 50 damage on a foe with 30 in all combat stats, it would drain 30 Defence and 20 Strength levels (leaving the target with 0 Defence and 10 Strength).
AgainstTekton, it drains his combat skills by 10 (following the stat drain order) if it fails to hit.
The special attack is similar in effect to theDorgeshuun crossbow,bone dagger,dragon warhammer,elder maul,barrelchest anchor, anddarklight.
The special attackanimation's colours can be changed to gold, which costs 75Last Man Standingpoints. Once unlocked, the gold trim can be toggled atJustine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standingwhenever the player desires.
