Theswamp lizardis a two-handedRangedweapon requiring level 30 inAttack,Ranged, andMagicto wield. The required ammunition for the swamp lizard isGuam tar.
Despite being able to perform Magic and Ranged attacks, this weapon requires the user to be in the opponent'smeleedistance to attack, potentially reducing the practicality of the two attack styles. However, it can be used to attack enemies from behind fences, and can also attack enemies in diagonal squares, meaning thatsafespottingis still possible.
