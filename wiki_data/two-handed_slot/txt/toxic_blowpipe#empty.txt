[Special Attack]
The projectile from the special attack.
A player performs the toxic blowpipe's special attack,Toxic Siphon.
The toxic blowpipe has aspecial attack,Toxic Siphon, which increases accuracy by 100% and damage by 50%, while healing the user by half of the damage dealt (rounded down). This consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy.
Similar to theSaradomin godswordspecial attack, if the target dies from the special attack, it will still heal the player based on what they would have hit if the target  had more Hitpoints; for example, if the hit was calculated to deal 20 damage and the target only has 4 Hitpoints, it will heal the player by 10 Hitpoints. For certain monsters, it heals based on the damage dealt before calculating damage reduction, such asVorkathduring its acid phase (where it will take 50% reduced damage),kurasksthat have 100% damage resistance to most weaponry, orAkkhaduring his melee and ranged states which are 100% resistant to Ranged attacks.
