[Special Attack]
A player performs the Saradomin godsword's special attack,Healing Blade.
The Saradomin godsword has aspecial attackcalledHealing Blade, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. When used, the player's max hit is increased by 10%, their accuracy is doubled, and it restoresHitpointsandPrayerequal to 50% and 25% respectively, of the damage dealt (rounded up in even intervals). This effect only occurs on a successful hit, and any hit below 22 damage will always heal the player for 10 Hitpoints and restore 5 Prayer points.Healing Bladerolls against the opponent's slash defence roll.
The special attackwillrestore health and prayer even if used against a target that has lower health or has immunity to conventional weaponry. For example,kuraskscan only be harmed by leaf-bladed weaponry,broad bolts, or theMagic Dartspell. If the Saradomin godsword would have hit a 40 on the kurask (which would result in 0 damage), it would still heal the player for 20 hitpoints and restore 10 prayer points. This also applies to any killing blows by the special attack; if a target had 2 hitpoints remaining and was struck with a special hit thatwouldhave dealt 60 damage, the player would still be healed for 30 hitpoints and restore 15 prayer points.
The special attackanimation's colours can be changed to gold, which costs 75Last Man Standingpoints. Once unlocked, the gold trim can be toggled atJustine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standingwhenever the player desires.
