[Special Attack]
A player performs the Saradomin godsword's special attack,Healing Blade.
The Saradomin godsword has aspecial attackcalledHealing Blade, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. When used, the player's max hit is increased by 10%, their accuracy is doubled, andHitpointsandPrayer Pointsare restored equal to 50% and 25% of the damage dealt respectively, rounded up in even intervals. This effect only occurs on a successful hit, and any hit below 22 damage will always heal the player for 10 Hitpoints and restore 5 Prayer points.Healing Bladerolls against the opponent's slash defence roll.
The Prayer andLife leechfromHealing Blade iscalculated from the potential damage of a swing before some types of damage immunities are applied. This can allow it to restore health and prayer even if a monster appears to take zero damage. For example,kuraskscan only be harmed by leaf-bladed weaponry,broad bolts, or theMagic Dartspell, but ifHealing Bladewould have otherwise hit a 40 before immunity, the restoration effect still takes place and heals the player for 20 hitpoints and restores 10 prayer points.
This mechanic also applies if the target has less total health than the potential damage of a swing. If a target with only 2 hitpoints remaining is struck with aHealing Bladethat would have dealt 60 damage, the player will still be healed for the full amount of 30 hitpoints and have 15 prayer points restored.
