[Weapon: Zamorak Godsword]


TheZamorak godswordis one of the five variants of theGodswordthat was fought over during theGod Wars. It is created by attaching aZamorak hilt, obtained fromK'ril Tsutsaroth, to a completedgodsword blade. Like all godsword variants, it requires 75Attackto wield.
Players can attach aZamorak godsword ornament kit, obtained frommaster clue scrolls, to cosmetically enhance the godsword, creating aZamorak godsword (or). This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It also becomes untradeable, returning both the godsword and the ornament kit when dismantled.

[Special Attack]
A player usesIce Cleave, the Zamorak godsword's special attack.
The Zamorak godsword has aspecial attack,Ice Cleave, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. It doubles the player's accuracy (slash or crush roll) and increases their max hit by 10%. In addition, it freezes the target in place for 19.2 seconds (32ticks); the same duration asIce Barrage. The sword's special attack must produce asuccessful hitin order to have the freezing effect, and it rolls against opponent's slash defence.Protect from Meleeonly gives a damage reduction of 40% and does not affect the freeze.
While its unique special attack may provide less utility than all other Godswords for the majority of situational uses, (e.g. it doesn't restore depleted stats, deplete opponent's stats, or deal any additional maximum damage relative to the other godswords), it is useful in numerous niche situations.
It is very popular in theCastle Warsminigamewhen used to freeze flag-bearers, as such players generally wear equipment with highMagic defencebonus, such asblack dragonhide,Karil's leathertop, and/orArmadyl armourin order to more easily defend against enemy mages castingAncient Magicks(orSnare/Entanglewith the standard spellbook). The use of this common strategy of possessing high magic defence bonus equipment, coupled with the game's particularmagic defence-determining mechanics (that ultimately benefit accounts with higher levels in magic than defence), reliably renders magic-based freezing methods consistently ineffective. The Zamorak godsword's melee-basedspecial attackis often used to undermine this tactic. In theWilderness, it can also be used to freeze an enemy in place in order to attack from a distance, escape, or provide a more diversified (and therefore reliable) freezing strategy for clans; a useful tactic inSingle-way combatis logging out while standing under a recently frozen enemy, as they will not unfreeze in time to retaliate.
The Zamorak godsword has also found use inplayer-vs-monstersituations. It is a popular weapon when fighting theMuttadiles, as it can stop them long enough from going to the meat tree to heal. It can also be used during theBarrowsminigame to freeze the melee-using brothers in place, particularlyDharok the Wretched.
The special attackanimation's colours can be changed to gold, which costs 75Last Man Standingpoints. Once unlocked, the gold trim can be toggled atJustine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standingwhenever the player desires.

Date | Changes
7 July2021(update) | The weapon's position on female players has been adjusted so that they appear to be equipped properly.
14 July2016(update) | The item's inventory sprite was reverted to the original version.
6 July2016(update) | The item's inventory sprite was slightly adjusted with the release of ornamental godswords.
12 November2015(update|poll) | The special attack cost has been reduced to 50%, down from 60%.
19 March2015(update|poll) | The accurate attack style of the Godswords has been adjusted to use slash rather than crush. As the slash attack bonus on Godswords has always been higher than the crush bonus, having the accurate attack style of the weapons use slash rather than crush means that the accurate attack style takes advantage of the best offensive bonus of the weapon.
7 November2013(update|poll) | The Accurate combat mode of godswords has been changed from 'Stab' to 'Crush', since godswords have no stab-attack bonusGodswords will now pop up a confirmation box when you try to dismantle them
