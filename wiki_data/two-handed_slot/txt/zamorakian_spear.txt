Unlike other spears, it cannot bepoisoned, and has its highest bonus instab, while other spears have the same bonus on all melee attack styles. The Zamorakian spear offers the third highest stab bonus of all weapons at +85, shared with theZamorakian hasta,dragon hunter lance, andcrystal halberd. It is only outmatched by theGhrazi rapierwith a stab bonus of +94 and theOsmumten's Fangwith a stab bonus of +105.
The Zamorakian spear is currently the strongest spear in the game. It is popular among players because of its versatility; it has stab,slashandcrushingoptions, making it useful on a wide array of monsters. Most notably, it is thestrongest spearto use against theCorporeal Beast. Mostdragons,drakes, andwyrmsare also weak to the stab attack type, but as a two-handed weapon it is incompatible with ananti-dragon shield; it is only advisable to use it in combination with asuper antifire potion(except against wyrms).

[Special Attack]
A player performs the Zamorakian spear's special attack,Shove.
The Zamorakian spear has aspecial attack,Shove, which it shares with thedragon spearandZamorakian hasta. It pushes an opponent back andstunsthem for three seconds, consuming 25% of the player's special attack energy.
The effects of this special are non-stackable, meaning that players cannot use the spear's special attack on a target who is already stunned. Stunned players are also given a one tick (0.6 seconds) period of immunity after a stun wears off in which they cannot be stunned again. In addition to this, as soon as the stun wears off, the stunned player is also granted a 5 tick (3.0 seconds) period of immunity against being bound in place by binding spells likeEntangleorIce Barrage.
The special attack cannot be used against large monsters, such asgiants, because they are too big to push back. If a player tries this, the special attack does not occur and no special attack energy is consumed. A message appears in the chat box, reading, "That creature is too large to knock back!" A general way to tell if the spear can use the "Shove" special attack is to determine how much space the target monster takes up. If it takes up more than one space, it cannot be shoved. For example, a player can shove anice warrior, which takes up one space, but not anice giant, which takes up four.
