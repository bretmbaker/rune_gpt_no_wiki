[Passive Effect]
A player attacks three opponents simultaneously with the Scythe of Vitur.
When the player attacks with a scythe, their attack range is increased to a 1x3 arc radius in front of the player, which can allow them to hit three 1x1 targets in front of them. When attacking a large creature (a monster that occupies more than twogame squares), the scythe will instead apply as many hits as possible to them. A 2x2 monster (such asVardorvis) will be hit twice per attack, while a 3x3 or larger monster (such asdragonsandDuke Sucellus) will be hit three times per attack.
These attacks' accuracy and strength rolls are rolled independently on each target, though each hit will deal 50% less damage, (rounded down), than the preceding hit. Even numbered base max hits gain an additional max hit on the 2nd hit, while every base max hit evenly divisible by 4, (e.g. 44, 48, 52), gain an additional max hit on the 3rd hit.
For example on a 3x3 monster, if a player has a base max hit of 47 with the scythe, their overall maximum hit is 81. However, increasing their base max hit to 48 gains an additional 2nd and 3rd max hit, increasing the overall maximum hit to 84.
Despite the reduced damage from the second and third hits, the scythe is still immensely powerful against large creatures, especially if they are weak to slash or have low Defence levels.
