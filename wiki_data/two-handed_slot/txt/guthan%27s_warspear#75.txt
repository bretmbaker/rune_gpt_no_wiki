[Weapon: Guthan%27S Warspear#75]


Guthan's warspearis a two-handedmelee weaponthat is part ofGuthan the Infested's setofbarrows equipmentand requires 70Attackto wield. It is the second most accurate spear in game, surpassed only by theZamorakian spear/hasta, which has +85 Stab. However, it is slower than most spears, having an attack rate of 5 ticks, rather than 4 ticks, and it cannot be poisoned.
If Guthan's warspear is wielded together with all other pieces of Guthan's armour set, then successful melee attacks have a 25% chance of restoring health to the user equal to the damage dealt to the target. This set has the potential to be extremely useful in a variety ofcombatsituations, due to its healing reducing the need to bringfood. While the set has strong combat stats, its durability can be conserved through only equipping it when a player needs to heal, and carrying alternative non-degradable armour and weaponry.
