[Weapon: Karil%27S Crossbow#(Broken)]


Karil's crossbowis a two-handedranged weaponthat is part ofKaril the Tainted's set of barrows equipment. It requires 70Rangedto wield. It firesbolt racks, which break upon firing. When equipped with the other three pieces ofKaril the Tainted's set the wearer will receive the set effect, which has a chance to temporarily lower their target'sAgilitylevel. Additionally, if anamulet of the damnedis worn alongside the set, there is also a 25% chance for each attack to deal a second hit for half the damage of the first.
Unlike standard crossbows, it is wielded in both hands. Furthermore, regular crossbows fire fewer, more powerful shots, meaning Karil's crossbow is actually similar in function to ashortbow; this gives it a potentially higher damage per second, at the expense of the shield slot. The crossbow has an attack range of 8. Longrange increases attack range by 2.
