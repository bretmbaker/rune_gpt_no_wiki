[Weapon: Gregg%27S Eastdoor]


Gregg's eastdooris an item that can be obtained from participating in anyEaster event, and was first obtained from the2021 Easter event. It is a two-handed fun weapon, with a similar equipped stance to theDinh's bulwark. However, it does not share its attack styles with the Bulwark, instead having regularbluntattack styles.
As afun weaponwith the lowest attack speed (and therefore lowest damage per second) out of all the fun weapons, Gregg's eastdoor is useful to bring into theWildernessto attack NPCs as anx-loggingmethod to escapeplayer killers. The reduced damage compared to other fun weapons increases the likelihood that the NPC you're attacking will survive the 60 seconds needed to forcefully logout.
