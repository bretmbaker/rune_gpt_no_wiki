[Weapon: Crystal Bow#Active]


Thecrystal bowis abowmade from enchantedelven crystal. It requires the completion ofRoving Elvesto wield, as well as 50Agilityand 70Ranged. The bow benefits from damage and accuracy boosts whencrystal armouris equipped.
A crystal bow is created when an elf sings to acrystal weapon seedand enchants it into a bow. The most prominent elf with this talent isIlfeen, who will perform this service for players for a price. However, she can only do this with a weapon seed; partially charged bows should be reverted to their seed form (using the right-click menu in the inventory) to be converted back into a bow.
