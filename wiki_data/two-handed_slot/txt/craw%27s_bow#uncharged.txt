[Passive Effect]
When Craw's bow is charged withrevenant ether, an additional 50% ranged accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking anyNPCin theWilderness, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not.
This effect will stack additively with aSlayer helmet (i)or multiplicatively with aSalve amulet(i)and their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes it the second strongest ranged weapon in the Wilderness after thewebweaver bow, surpassing the damage output of atoxic blowpipewithdragon darts.
