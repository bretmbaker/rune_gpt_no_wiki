[Weapon: Crystal Felling Axe#Inactive]


Thecrystal felling axeis a type offelling axerequiring a level of 70Attackand 50Agilityto be equipped respectively, and aWoodcuttinglevel of 71 to be used. Players can create the axe by either using afelling axe handleon acrystal axewhile standing near asinging bowl, or by using the singing bowl directly with adragon felling axe, acrystal tool seed, and 120crystal shards. Doing so requires level 76Smithing(boostable)and 76Crafting(boostable)tosingthe crystal, and grants 6,000 experience in both skills. Players can configure the charges while the axe is in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials. If the player does not meet the Smithing and Crafting requirements, they can haveConwennaorReesesing the crystal for them for an extra 60 crystal shards, for a total of 180. After creation, the player can revert the crystal felling axe back into a dragon felling axe. This process returns the crystal tool seed and the dragon felling axe to the player, but all crystal shards used to create or charge the axe are lost.
Applying the felling handle to the axe isirreversible: a one-handed axe upgraded into a felling axe can never revert to being one-handed.The standard process of reverting crystal to dragon does apply. The crystal felling axe will start off with 10,000 charges, unless a previously used crystal axe was used in its creation, in which case it will instead inherit the remaining charges from that axe.
