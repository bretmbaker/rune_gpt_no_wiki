[Special Attack]
A player performing the magic shortbow's special attack,Snapshot.
This weapon also has aspecial attack,Snapshot, which will shoot two arrows in rapid succession, using 55% of a player's special attack energy. While the in-game tooltip states thatSnapshothas reduced accuracy, it actually likely has an accuracy boost of107or about 43%.[1]
Snapshotuses a custom form of damage calculation that does not take into account offensive Prayers (such asEagle Eye) when determining a player'smaximum Ranged hit,[2]but its accuracy is still affected.[3]
The following formula can be used to calculate the max hit ofSnapshot:Maximum Hit=⌊0.5+(Visible Ranged Level+10)*(Ammo Ranged Strength+64)640⌋[a][b][c][d]
^Only the player's visible ranged level matters. Boosts given through prayers and Void Knight armour are ignored.^A stance bonus of 10 is used regardless of attack style used.^The ranged strength bonus of the player's armour and gear is ignored. Only the ranged strength bonus of the player's ammo is used. In the case of Rune thrownaxes, the weapon's ranged strength is used instead.^The bonus damage usually provided by wearing a Slayer helmet (i), Salve amulet (i) or Salve amulet (ei) is ignored.
