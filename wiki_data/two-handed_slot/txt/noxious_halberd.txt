[Special Attack]
A player performs the noxious halberd's special attack,Virulence.
The noxious halberd has aspecial attack,Virulence, which consumes 50% of the wielder's special attack energy.Virulencecan only be used if the player is afflicted withpoisonorvenom, which instantly cures either condition. The player's next accurate attack with the halberd will have its minimum hit increased by the damage the player would have taken from their cured affliction. This effect is lost if the player changes weapon or logs out.
For example, a poisoned player who is poised to take 16 poison damage can useVirulenceto cure themselves, and their next accurate attack will do a damage roll between 16 and their max hit.
Note thatVirulencedoes not give any period of immunity towards poison and venom.
