[Weapon: Twisted Bow]


Thetwisted bowis a rare reward from theChambers of Xericthat requires aRangedlevel of 85 to wield. It can fire any type of arrow, includingdragon arrows. The twisted bow is extremely valuable due to its unmatched power against monsters with a high Magic level or accuracy bonus, such asCommander ZilyanaandTzKal-Zuk.
Similar to thecrystal bow, the bow has anattack rangeof 10 tiles. As all attacks have a maximum of 10 range,long rangedoes not provide any attack distance benefit but may still be used to gainDefenceXP.

[Passive Effect]
A graph that shows the accuracy and damage modifiers at different Magic levels. Note that the "buff %" is not anincrease: at 100%, the accuracy and damage are normal rather than doubled.
Unlike other bows that have a set strength, the twisted bow functions differently: the higher the target'sMagiclevel or Magic accuracy is (whichever is higher), the higher the bow's accuracy and damage. The accuracy multiplier caps at 140%, while the damage multiplier caps at 250%.[1][2]The Magic level or accuracy caps at 250 outside theChambers of Xeric, and 350 within.
