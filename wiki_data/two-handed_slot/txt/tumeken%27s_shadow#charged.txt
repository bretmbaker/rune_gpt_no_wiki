[Passive Effect]
Tumeken's shadow has apassive effectexclusive to its built-in spell, in which the player's magic attack bonus andmagic damageare multiplied by three from the player's worn equipment (four within the Tombs of Amascut), capped at a total of 100% magic damage, although this threshold is not currently attainable. This multiplicative effect includes tripling or quadrupling negative magic attack and damage bonuses.
The passive effect is extremely powerful with max mage gear, as it pushes the player's accuracy incredibly high, even when facing magic-resistant monsters such asGeneral GraardorandCommander Zilyana. The staff's max hit also pushes higher with the maximum possible magic damage boost, even more than asanguinesti staffand afortified ward. It still hits lower than thetwisted bow(when comparing both at max boosts), though it makes up for it for being more accurate in such cases.
The passive multiplicative effect does not amplify theVoid Knight equipment,salve amulet(ei), or theimbued slayer helmet, although Tumeken's shadow still benefits ordinarily from these bonuses. For PvP, in scenarios where Tumeken's shadow can be used against players (such asminigames), the multiplier does not apply for balancing reasons.
