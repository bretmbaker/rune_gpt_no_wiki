[Weapon: Seercull]


Theseercullis a Fremennik bow that requires aRangedlevel of 50 to wield, and fires arrows up toAmethyst. Compared to amagic shortbow, it has a slower rate of fire and a differentspecial attackwhich is more effective against mages. In addition, its normal and rapid fire attacks have one more range than that of ashortbow, and its long range attack is equivalent to that of acomposite bow. It is a comparable weapon to theMagic comp bow.
The name can be attributed to the combination of the wordseer(another word for "mage" or "wizard") and the wordcull(another word for "kill"), in other words, themage-killer. This is a fitting name because of the effect of its special attack and its examine text.

[Special Attack]
A player using the bow's special attack,Soulshot.
The Seercull has aspecial attack,Soulshot, which consumes 100% of the player's special attack energy. It isguaranteed to hitand lowers the opponent'sMagiclevel equal to damage dealt. However, damage inflicted bySoulshotis only boosted strictly through ammunition and visible range level. Rangedprayers(such asEagle EyeandRigour) and all other equipment providing range strength, including those with special effects such as any variants of:Void Knight equipment,salve amulet, orSlayer helmet, will all have no effect. The special attack will only drain the opponent's level once; consecutive use ofSoulshotwill have zero effect on their magic level until the stat has been fully restored, at which point it may be reapplied.[1]
In PvP combat, the special attack gains use for its ability to lower the Magic level of a mage to prevent them from casting spells. However, this can be mitigated by use ofsuper restorepotions.
The following formula can be used to calculate the max hit ofSoulshot:Maximum Hit=⌊0.5+(Visible Ranged Level+10)*(Ammo Ranged Strength+64)640⌋[a]
^A stance bonus of 10 is used regardless of attack style used.
