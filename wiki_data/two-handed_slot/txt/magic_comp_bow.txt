Composite bows can be fired from 10squares awayat both rapid and long range styles; this combination of speed and distance is matched only by thecrystal bow,scorching bowandbow of Faerdhinen.

[Special Attack]
The magic comp bow's special attack,Powershot, isguaranteed to hitthe target. This consumes 35% of the player's special attack energy. This special attack is also shared with themagic longbow, to the extent of copying the magic longbow's attack speed for this hit - this functionally makes the special attack 1 tick slower than the comp bow's regular attack.
Powershotuses a custom form of damage calculation that does not take into account offensive Prayers (such asEagle Eye) when determining a player'smaximum Ranged hit.[1]
The following formula can be used to calculate the max hit ofPowershot:Maximum Hit=⌊0.5+(Visible Ranged Level+10)*(Ammo Ranged Strength+64)640⌋[a][b][c][d]
^Only the player's visible ranged level matters. Boosts given through prayers and Void Knight armour are ignored.^A stance bonus of 10 is used regardless of attack style used.^The ranged strength bonus of the player's armour and gear is ignored. Only the ranged strength bonus of the player's ammo is used. In the case of Rune thrownaxes, the weapon's ranged strength is used instead.^The bonus damage usually provided by wearing a Slayer helmet (i), Salve amulet (i) or Salve amulet (ei) is ignored.
