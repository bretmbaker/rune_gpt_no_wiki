[Weapon: Soulreaper Axe]


TheSoulreaper axeis a two-handed axe that requires 80AttackandStrengthto wield. It is created by combining four untradeable components, obtained as drops fromThe Leviathan,The Whisperer,Vardorvis, andDuke Sucellus, alongside 2,000blood runesand level 75Magic(which cannot be boosted).
The axe has a passive on-attack effect, which damages the wielder 8 Hitpoints, and grants a "Soul stack" for every attack they make. As long as a player is not at the maximum amount of stacks (5) and has more than 8 hitpoints, they will take damage and receive one stack of this effect. EachSoul stackprovides a 6% boost to a player'sStrengthLevel, up to a maximum of +30% at five stacks. These stacks can be used for the Special AttackBehead, or lost at the rate of one per 20 ticks (12 seconds) of the player not attacking. The player is healed for 8 hitpoints for eachSoul stacklost over time or otherwise used through the special attack.

[Special Attack]
A player performing the soulreaper axe's special attack,Behead,with five Soul Stacks.
The Soulreaper axe has aspecial attack,Behead, which consumes all Soul Stacks. This attack does not cost special attack energy and can be used as long as the player has at least one Soul stack.
For each Soul Stack consumed,Beheadincreases the player's accuracy and damage by 6% and heals them by 8 Hitpoints, effectively restoring any health spent to create those Soul stacks. Players are healed regardless of whether the attack was asuccessful hitor not.  If a player is at full health and has activeSoul stacksthey can utilize them as a temporary health bank; usingBeheadto restore up to 40 hitpoints instantly when needed.
Although the in-game description statesBeheaddeals additional damage, the special attack's increased accuracy is the only significant benefit. This is because theStrengthboost from Soul stacks is consumed first and a separate bonus is applied to the swing at a different stage in the damage calculation. This typically results inBeheaddealing similar maximum hits as a player that continues to auto attack with the Soul stack boost active.It's unknown if this is intentional behavior at this time, as this can result inBeheaddealing slightly less damage than an auto attack would otherwise in some situations.
The accuracy roll forBeheaduses the attack bonus of the player's currently selected style, which is rolled against the corresponding defensive bonuses of an opponent – either slash or crush in this case.[1]This is in contrast to most other special attacks, which roll against the defensive bonuses of an opponent of a specific combat style regardless of the attacking combat style chosen (for example, thedragon dagger's special attack will always roll against the opponent's slash defence, even if the attack style is set to stab).
Equipping the Soulreaper axe replaces the special attack interface with a unique graphic that indicates the Soul stack resource, however player's special attack energy continues to regenerate in the background normally. Since the special attack only consumes Soul stacks, it's useful to comboBeheadinto special attacks from other weapons. Some notable examples being thedragon warhammerto reduce an enemy's stats, or weapons like thegranite maulfor high amounts of burst damage.
