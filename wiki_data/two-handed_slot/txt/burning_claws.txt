[Special Attack]
A player performing the burning claws' special attack,Burning barrage.
The burning claws have aspecial attack,Burning barrage, which drains 30% of the player's special attack energy.Burning barragehits an enemy three times in succession, rolling against the opponent's slash or stab defence (depending on the combat style used).
Each of the three hits also has a chance to inflict aburnon the target, dealing a total of 10 damage over the course of 40 ticks (24 seconds). Burn effects can be stacked with each other up to a cap of five active burns. One spec can inflict 0, 10, 19, 20, or 29 burn damage, taking 40-44 ticks depending on the case. The chance to inflict a burn scales based on which of the attack's three accuracy rolls is the first to succeed: 15% if the first roll succeeds, 30% if the second roll succeeds, and 45% if the third rolls succeeds.
Burning barrageworks as follows:
Roll accuracy. If successful, roll total damage between 75% and 175% of the maximum hit. Divide the damage into three hitsplats as 25%-25%-50%. Each hitsplat has a 15% chance to inflict burn.If first roll misses, reroll accuracy. If successful,  roll total damage between 50% and 150% of the maximum hit. Divide the damage into three hitsplats as 50%-50%-0%, then subtract 1 from the first two hitsplats and add that damage to the third hitsplat (e.g., a total roll of 16 becomes 7-7-2). Each hitsplat has a 30% chance to inflict burn.If the second roll misses, reroll accuracy. If successful, roll total damage between 25% and 125% of the maximum hit. Divide the damage into three hitsplats as 0%-0%-100%, then subtract 2 from the third hitsplat and add 1 to each of the other two hitsplats (e.g., a total roll of 9 becomes 1-1-7). Each hitsplat has a 45% chance to inflict burn.If all three accuracy rolls miss, there is a 20% chance of dealing 0 damage, a 40% chance of dealing 1 damage, and a 40% chance of dealing 2 damage. These hits cannot inflict burn.
All of the minimum and maximum hit calculations are rounded down, and the individual hitsplats are rounded down as well. For example, for a normal maximum hit of 39, the minimum and maximum hits for the first accuracy roll case are calculated as floor(0.75 * 39) and floor(1.75 * 39), resulting in a damage range of 29-68. If 29 damage is rolled, the hitsplats are calculated as floor(0.25 * 29), floor(0.25 * 29), and floor(0.5 * 29), resulting in a hit of 7-7-14â€”a total of 28 actual damage, despite originally rolling for 29 damage.
