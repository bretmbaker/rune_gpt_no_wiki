[Weapon: Dark Bow#Blue]


Thedark bowis a two-handedranged weaponthat requires level 60 inRangedto wield. It can only be obtained as a drop fromdark beastsand their superior variant,night beasts. With anattack speedof 9 (5.4 seconds), and 8 on rapid (4.8 seconds), this bow stands out as the slowest weapon in the game. It fires two arrows per attack which roll independent accuracy checks.[1]It has the maximum possibleattack rangeof 10, so thelongrangeattack style will not increase its attack range.
Assuming that both weapons are set to therapidattack style, the dark bow has a firing time of2.4seconds per arrow, whereas a shortbow such as themagic shortbow (i)takes only1.8. Because of this, the dark bow is only fairly popular forplayer killing. It has one of the highest max hits of any weapons in the game by means ofspecial attack, along with the crystal halberd and dragon dagger, although thetwisted bowandDharok's greataxecan hit harder with regular attacks, and thedragon 2h swordandDinh's bulwarkare able to deal more total damage with their special attack.

[Special Attack]
A player performing one of the dark bow's special attacks,Descent of Dragons.
Two different attacks comprise the dark bow's uniquespecial attack, both of which consume 55% of the player's special attack energy.
The 1st special attack,Descent of Darkness, deals up to 30% more damage with a minimum of 5 damage per arrow. The animation shows two arrows fired at the target, surrounded in a black shroud.
If the player hasdragon arrowsequipped, the 2nd special attack,Descent of Dragons, is used instead. This attack deals up to 50% more damage with a minimum of 8 damage per arrow, while capping the max hit at 48 damage per arrow.[2]The animation shows twoblack dragonheads fired at the target.
After landing aDescent of Dragonsattack, an ordinary damage roll is made up to the player's maximum Ranged hit, and all rolls that exceed the damage cap are then reduced back to 48.[3]The minimum damage of 8 is still affected by damage multipliers on some monsters, for example the damage is lowered to a minimum of 2 damage per arrow onIce Demonor a minimum (and maximum) of 0 damage per arrows on aGuardianinChambers of Xeric.
