[Weapon: Red Salamander]


Thered salamanderis the third strongestsalamanderand can be caught using a net trap and theHunterskill at level 59. It requires level 60Ranged, 60Attack, and 60Magicto wield.
Despite being able to perform Magic and Ranged attacks, this weapon requires the user to be in the opponent'smeleedistance to attack, potentially reducing the practicality of the two attack styles. However, it can be used to attack enemies from behind fences, and can also attack enemies in diagonal squares, meaning thatsafespottingis still possible.
