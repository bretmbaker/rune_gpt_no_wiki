[Special Attack]
A player performs the dragon spear's special attack,Shove.
The dragon spear has aspecial attack,Shove, which it shares with theZamorakian spearandhasta. It pushes an opponent back andstunsthem for 5 ticks (3.0 seconds), consuming 25% of the player's special attack energy.
The effects of this special are non-stackable, meaning that players cannot use the spear's special attack on a target who is already stunned. Stunned players are also given a one tick (0.6 seconds) period of immunity after a stun wears off in which they cannot be stunned again. This effectively means the special attack cannot be used on the same target more than once every 6 ticks. In addition to this, as soon as the stun wears off, the stunned player is also granted a 5 tick (3.0 seconds) period of immunity against being bound in place by binding spells likeEntangleorIce Barrage. Despite this, the special attack is popular in player killing as the brief stun causes all incoming damage to be ignored until it dissipates, after which all damage taken is applied at once.
In addition, it cannot be used against large monsters, such asgiants, because they are too big to push back. If a player tries this, the special attack does not occur and no special attack energy is consumed. A message appears in the chat box, reading, "That creature is too large to knock back!" A general way to tell if the spear can use the "Shove" special attack is to determine how much space the target monster takes up. If it takes up more than one space, it cannot be shoved. For example, a player can shove anice warrior, which takes up one space, but not anice giant, which takes up four.
