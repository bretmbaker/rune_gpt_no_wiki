A stone bowlis an unobtainable item present in theRuneScape 2beta. It would have been used in the original version ofElemental Workshop I. Presumably, players would have been required to fill it with lava from a trough in the workshop, which would then have been used to restart the furnace. This would allow the player to smelt someelemental metal.
