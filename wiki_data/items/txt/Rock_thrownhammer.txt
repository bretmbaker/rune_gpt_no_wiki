Arock thrownhammerisslayer equipmentthat is required to killgargoyles. Unlike therock hammer, the rock thrownhammer can be used to finish off gargoyles without having to do so within melee distance. This is useful for finishing off gargoyles when ranging from a safespot, or when finishing offDawn. Since they are consumed upon usage, players should buy enough thrownhammers for their slayer task.
