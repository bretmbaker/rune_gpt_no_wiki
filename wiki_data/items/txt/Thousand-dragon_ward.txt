Thethousand-dragon wardis an offensive shield that was obtainable during theRaging Echoes Leaguefrom the Echo variant of theKing Black Dragon. While equipped, the player is immune to a number of status effects and attacks, includingpoison,venom,dragonfire(except fromdrakes),icy breath,swamp decay,disease,desert heat, andchillstat-drains. This immunity also applies to more specific damage sources, such asNex's ice prison, theKaruulm Slayer Dungeonfloor, andpoison gas clouds.  Note that this will NOT prevent damage from Echo King Black Dragon's venom attack, but will prevent the venom status effect from being applied. The ward does not provide immunity to stat drain effect frombasilisks.
