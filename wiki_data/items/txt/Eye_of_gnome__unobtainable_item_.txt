Aneye of gnomeis an unobtainable version of theEye of gnome. Eyes of gnome could previously be traded and turned into bank notes; however, they were made untradeable in 2007 due to frequent use in scams. Any player who had a noted eye was given this now discontinued item. It is identical to the real eye, except it is stackable.
