"Lifeboat"was the name originally given to an unobtainable item that exists in the game cache. It was created to replace theViking toy ship. Since items could not be fully removed once created, the lifeboat was added in a hidden update in 2005 to fill this slot. The actual item was just a copy of a pink skirt.
