AKhazard armouris aquest itemin theFight Arenaquest. It is a dark colouredplatebodythat is part of theKhazard armour set. It has stats worse than abronze platebody, but unlike most melee armours, it does not have a penalty toMagicorRangedaccuracy, nor does it interfere withAva's devices, making it a viable choice for mages and rangers. It also weighs far less than a typicalplatebody. Another nearby quest item,Carnillean armour, has over double the stab defence and +3 slash defence bonuses, at the cost of -2 crush defence and nearly 20x theweight.
