Sanfew serumis a potion found in theLast Man Standingminigamethat combines the properties ofsuper restore,superantipoison, andRelicym's balmpotions(though, unlike the latter, will provide fifteen minutes of immunity todiseasewhen consumed). The duration of the antipoison lasts six minutes, the same time as a superantipoison does. The restore value obtained per dose is 4 + 30% of the player's base level (round down) in each of the affected skills. Unlike normalSanfew serums, these lack an "Empty" option.
