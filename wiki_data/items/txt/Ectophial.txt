Theectophialis a reward for completing theGhosts Ahoyquest. Players can empty it, causing them to be teleported to theEctofuntusoutsidePort Phasmatys. Once the player teleports, they will automatically refill it. The player cannot interrupt the refilling animation themselves, and is immune to damage for the duration; onPvP worlds, an attacker will still gain experience on a successful hit, but no damage will be dealt. This makes the ectophial basically an unlimited teleport to the Ectofuntus.
