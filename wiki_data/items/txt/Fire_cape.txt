Thefire capeis amelee capeobtained as a reward for completing theTzHaar Fight Cave. It is the second best melee cape in the game, outclassed only by theinfernal cape.
In order to obtain the fire cape, players must survive all waves of TzHaar Fight Caves and defeatTzTok-Jad. Note that the capewill notbe awarded should both the player and TzTok-Jad die simultaneously, even though theboss logwill count the kill. The player must be taken out of the cave by the game recognising TzTok-Jad's death; if they are removed from the cave due to dying, the game considers the player to have failed the challenge.
