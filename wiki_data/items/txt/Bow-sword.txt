Thebow-swordis required in theDevious Mindsquest, for themonkat thePaterdomus Templeon the way toCanifis. Although the bow sword offers a wield option, the player unfortunately can't wield it, as attempting to do so produces an exclamation that "It's a bow and a sword...how am I supposed to use this?!" Asking the monk to teach the player how to use it produces the comment that "it's a foreign weapon" and "perhaps later" one of their warriors can teach them.
