Chocolate kebbitswere an item obtained during the2013 Easter event. Players had to "Grab" these enchanted kebbits from the ground as they hopped around in a rabbit hole. It has an "Eat" option, but cannot be eaten and instead gives the message "I'm not going to eat that! It's wiggling.". It is also stackable, and if the player chooses to drop it, one kebbit would be let loose on the ground and run away (Even through walls, in some cases.). It could be dropped outside the rabbit hole, a message would appear stating "The chocolate kebbit refuses to budge from your pack."
