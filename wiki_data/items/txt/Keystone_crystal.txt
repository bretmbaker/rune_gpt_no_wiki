Thekeystone crystalis obtained from the other side of the tightrope in the tightrope room within theChambers of Xeric. Attempting to cross the tightrope will cause any idledeathly rangersanddeathly magesto attack those who cross the rope. The crystal is required to disable the glowing barrier leading deeper into the chambers. Once it is used on the barrier, it is consumed as it dispels it, killing off any deathly rangers and mages still alive at the time.
