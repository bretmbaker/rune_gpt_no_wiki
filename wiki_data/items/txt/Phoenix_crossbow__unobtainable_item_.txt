ThePhoenix crossbowsare twounobtainable itemsreleased with the rework ofShield of Arrav. They are identical to the regularPhoenix crossbow. Since the quest requiresBlack Arm Gangmembers to steal two phoenix crossbows, it is possible that these would have been quest-specific variants. Therefore, players would have been unable to complete this portion of the quest by simply buying phoenix crossbows from another player. However, they were ultimately never added.
