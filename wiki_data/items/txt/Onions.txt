Onionsis asackthat contains between one and tenonions. They are used namely in theFarmingskill. If a player has an empty sack in theirinventoryand clicks on it while onions are also in the inventory up to ten onions will be placed in the sack. To remove onions from the sack requires right clicking the sack of onions and selecting the menu option that removes one onion at a time. Sacks can be bought from manyfarming stores, such as the one in the chicken farm north ofPort Sarim. A maximum of ten onions can be put into a sack. Once ten onions are in the sack and a player tries to put more, it will be full. This works the same way withcabbagesandpotatoes, except for cabbages inDraynor Manor.
