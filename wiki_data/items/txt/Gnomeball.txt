Gnomeballsare received by winning 5 points in a game ofGnome Ballor from thegnome restaurantminigame. With the item in your inventory, you can click "Use" with it, and click another player. If that player has their right hand empty, they will catch the ball, and it will end up in their weapon slot. It is not advised that you throw it to a player you do not know, as they can very easily walk away with it.
