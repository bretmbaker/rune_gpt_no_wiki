"Skull"was the name originally given to an unobtainable item that exists in the game cache. It was created to replace the noted form of the plainwigfromPrince Ali Rescue. Since items could not be fully removed once created, it was added in a hidden update in 2005 to fill this slot. The actual item was just a copy of a pink skirt.
