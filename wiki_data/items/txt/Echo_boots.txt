Echo bootsare an enhanced pair ofguardian bootswhich require level 75Defenceto wear. They are made by combining the boots with anecho crystal, a rare drop from participating in theFortis Colosseum. Compared to its predecessor, it gives an additional +2prayer bonusand a passive effect in which the boots deal 1 recoil damage to targets attacking the player, in a 3x3 square around the player. This effectively restricts recoiled targets to those in melee range.
