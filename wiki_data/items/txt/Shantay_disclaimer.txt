TheShantay disclaimerwas an item that was given to players passing through theShantay Pass, saying that no responsibility is taken if the player dies in the desert. By retaining one, players were able to skip a long-winded dialogue explaining the dangers of entering the desert. This system was replaced with theDoomsayerin July 2007, and the shantay disclaimers were removed. As a result, they have never been obtainable inOld School RuneScape.
