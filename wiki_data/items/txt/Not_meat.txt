Not meatis anunobtainable itemthat dropped fromsabre-toothed kebbitsfor about an hour after the addition ofVarlamore. The item could originally be bought and sold on theGrand Exchange, but was never listed on theGrand Exchange Database. About an hour after the update, the item was removed from the inventories of any players who still had them. However, they were not removed from any uncollected Grand Exchange offers, nor were they removed from the private storage units in theChambers of Xeric. As such, they are still in the game.
