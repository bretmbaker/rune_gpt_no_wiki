Chinchompas are thrown likedartsorthrowing knives; however, they explode on impact. InPvM, they can hit up to 11 targets in a 3x3 area. InPvP, the cap is 9 targets. They cannot be picked up again from the ground after being thrown, andAva's devicedoes not return them. Throwing a chinchompa at a group determines the maximum hit for the whole group, so if the chinchompa hits a 0 on one member of the group, it will hit a 0 on all of them; if it hits a 10 on one member of the group, it will hit up to 10 on all of them. The accuracy roll made on the initial target uses the 'heavy' ranged defence for determining the opponent's defence roll.
