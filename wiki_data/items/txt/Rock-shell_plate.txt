Therock-shell plateis a piece of melee armour with stats almost identical to therune platebody. To wear a rock-shell plate, players must have at least 40 Defence and haveThe Fremennik Trialsquest completed. The plate can be considered as a second alternative to therune platebody, as completing theDragon Slayer Iquest isn't a requirement to wear the rock-shell plate. The rock-shell plate also has a slightly better range attack bonus than the rune platebody and does not interfere with the effects ofAva's deviceso it may be viable for a range tank setup.
