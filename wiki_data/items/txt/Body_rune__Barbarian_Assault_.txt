Body runesare unobtainable runes released alongside theBarbarian Assaultminigame that would have been obtained from theAttacker item machinewhen playing theAttackerrole. To prevent any glitches where players may be able to take runes outside of the minigame and sell them for profit, untradeable versions of each rune were added. However, the machine only gives runes that are directly used in combat spells. As a result, Body runes cannot be obtained by players.
