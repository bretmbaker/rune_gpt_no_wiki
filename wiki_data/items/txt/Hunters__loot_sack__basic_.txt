Basic hunters' loot sacksare a reward for successfully completing noviceHunters' Rumoursassigned byHuntmaster Gilman.  Note that certain drops scale with certain skill levels such as Woodcutting; players with a higher Woodcutting level have a better chance of obtaining a higher tier log. However, it is possible (though very unlikely) for a player with a low skill level to obtain such items (e.g. a player with Woodcutting level 30 to receive aYew log.)
