Apot of vinegarcan be made by pouring ajug of vinegarinto an emptypot. During theRag and Bone Man Iquest various bones that are dropped from creatures around RuneScape can be added to the pot (one bone per pot, 8 pots total) and boiled over the fire outside the Odd Old Man's house. This will clean the bones and they can then be given to the old man to complete the quest (you don't have to bring them all together in the quest though).
