Thestrange old lockpickis a potential reward from theHallowed Sepulchre. It allows any door withinBarrowsto be opened when used on the doors. It comes with 50 charges, using one after it is used to open a set of double-doors. The lockpick is tradeable until it has been used. After all 50 charges have been used it disappears. When running low on charges, theHigh Level Alchemyspell can be used to recuperate some of the costs back, since its alch value stays high even when used.
