AHollow reedis an unobtainable version of theHollow reed. Reeds could previously be traded and turned into bank notes; however, they were made untradeable in 2007 due to frequent use in scams. Any player who had a noted Hollow reed was given this now discontinued item. Originally, it was identical to the real reed, except stackable.
