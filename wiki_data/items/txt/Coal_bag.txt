Thecoal bagis a reward purchasable fromProspector Percy's Nugget Shopfor 100golden nuggets. The coal bag holds up to 27 pieces ofcoal(36 if asmithing capeis equipped). When smelting orsuperheating, coal in the bag will be used after the coal in theinventory. It is refillable just likeessence pouches, though unlike an essence pouch, it does notdegrade. This is useful for both mining and smithing as it effectively doubles the amount of coal a player can carry and thus the number of bars a player can make per inventory of ore. Coal placed inside the bag will not add additional weight to your character until removed from the coal bag.
