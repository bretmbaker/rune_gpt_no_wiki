The discontinuedbird nestfromWysonwas an old variant of theWyson seed nestobtainable before anupdateon18 February2016. After this update, the existing nests were discontinued, and newly obtained nests would instead be adifferent variant. All nests previously obtained would remain in banks and inventories, and the new nests obtained would provide better rewards. This change was made to prevent players from obtaining large quantities of the better seeds immediately after the update occurred.
