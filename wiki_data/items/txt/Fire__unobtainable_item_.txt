Fireis anunobtainable itemthat was presumably intended for use during theDesert Treasure Iquest. It would most likely have been found in theSmoke Dungeon, as part of a subquest for finding the Fire diamond, alongside the fire key. As the fire diamond was changed to thesmoke diamondinstead, the fire key was changed to theWarm key, and the Fire object was removed.
