ThePrison keyis part of therandom eventinvolvingPrison Pete. It is obtained by popping one of theballoon animals. Although it has a "return" option, the player automatically walks back to Prison Pete after he tells them to. If the correct balloon animal has been popped, this key will unlock one of the barriers. If not, another barrier will be added for you to unlock. Five barriers is the maximum amount. If the key is dropped it will vanish and the player must pop another balloon animal to get a new one.
