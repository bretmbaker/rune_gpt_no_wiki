Leprechaun charmswere a stackable item used inWoodcutting. When in the inventory or stored in aForestry kit, there was a chance of spawning aWoodcutting Leprechaun, depositing logs to the player's bank. If the player's charm was consumed after attracting the Leprechaun, he also acted as aBank Deposit Box. The chance of this occurring was scaled on the number of players present. When a charm was consumed, a game message in the chatbox stated:Your charm has attracted a Leprechaun.
