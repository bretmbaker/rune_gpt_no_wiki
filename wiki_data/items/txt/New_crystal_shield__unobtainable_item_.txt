TheNew crystal shieldis an unobtainable version of thehistorical crystal shield. Originally, the new crystal shield was tradeable and could be turned into banknotes. With the release ofSong of the Elves, all crystal equipment was made untradeable. Any banknote versions of the New crystal shield would have been turned into this unique discontinued variant. However, all crystal items were reverted back toCrystal weapon seedsin the same update anyway; therefore this item has never been obtainable.
