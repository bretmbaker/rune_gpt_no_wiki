Awily catis a special variant of a petcat, which players gain access to by completing theRatcatchersquest. After completion, players can speak toFelkrashto have her train theirovergrown catinto a wily cat. (Warning: After training your overgrown cat to be a wily cat, you will start from zero for the number of rats caught for thecat training medal. Wily cats are also ineligible for the medal.) Wily cats are the best hunters of any cat, with a success rate of 70%. When fightinghell-rat behemothsthey have higher health, get hit less often, and can hit slightly higher than regular cats. In addition, they can also catchkalphite larvaeandbutterflies(as well asHunterbutterflies, though this yields noexperience). Wily cats do not require food of any kind (except when fighting hell-rat behemoths).
