ThePhoenix hq keywas an item used in the first months ofRuneScapeduring theShield of Arravquest to access thePhoenix Gang's headquarters. Previously, after delivering theIntel reporttoStraven, two keys would be received.The quest was silently reworked in a hidden update several months after release; the key was removed in favour of Straven not letting players enter the hideout if they had not joined the gang. At the time of its release, it was tradeable, since non-tradeable items did not exist during 2001.
