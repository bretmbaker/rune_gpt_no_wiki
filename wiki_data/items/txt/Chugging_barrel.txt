Thechugging barrelis a tradeable item that allows players to consume up to five potions in a single click. It is purchased from theMixology Rewardsshop in a disassembled state with 17,250Mox resin, 14,000Aga resin, and 18,600Lye resin, which are earned from participating in theMastering Mixologyminigame. The barrel is only tradeable in its disassembled state (where it cannot store potions); players must use the 'Assemble' option in order for the barrel to become useable. While the assembled barrel is untradeable, it is possible to dismantle the barrel at any time, although doing so will cause all potions currently stored inside to be lost.
