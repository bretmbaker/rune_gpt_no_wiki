"Box of delights"was the name originally given to an unobtainable item that existed in the game cache. It was created to replace the unique version ofshrimpsoriginally obtained onTutorial Island, which had been deleted. Since items could not be fully removed once created, the box of delights was added in a hidden update in 2005 to fill this slot. The actual item was just a copy of a pink skirt.
