TheJal-nib-rek(roughly translated asForeign Nibbler Baby/Young) is aJal-Nibdropped byTzKal-Zukupon completion of theInferno. The standard drop rate is 1/100, but this is increased to 1/75 if TzKal-Zuk is defeated while on aSlayertask. Players may also exchange theirinfernal capesby speaking toTzHaar-Ket-Kehfor a 1/100 chance of obtaining the pet. Providing a player defeats TzKal-Zuk while on a slayer task for a 1/75 chance of the pet,andhands in their cape, the overall chance of receiving the pet from either the boss or the cape is approximately 1/43.
