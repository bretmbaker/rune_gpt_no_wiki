Players were given the amulet byKing Lathasso that he could inform them upon the discovery of a way into the forests ofIsafdar; similar to how Lathas' Messenger appears forRegicide. The amulet's gem was green until the release ofUnderground Pass, when it changed red. To begin the quest, players needed to visit King Lathas.
