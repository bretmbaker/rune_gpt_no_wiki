TheServant's skullwas an item that was used during the2014 Halloween event. The Grim Reaper had a task for players to find his servant that went missing shortly after. He notices this when spider webs were starting to build up around the house. The Grim Reaper asks you to go to the backyard (which was a maze) and try to locate him. After traversing through the maze, you eventually find the servants skull. The skull had to be brought back in order to give word about the servant's "unexpected" death.
