Arder-musca poisonsare a fungal-based poison made from mixing sixarder powder, sixmusca powder, and sixsalax saltin theFermentation Vatwithin the asylum whereDuke Sucellusresides. Two are needed to wake the Duke up to begin the fight against him. Having more than two (i.e. stocking up) is not needed as excess potions will be removed from the player's inventory if the player teleports out or uses them to wake the Duke. Mushrooms can be used in place of powder (e.g. 5 arder powder and 1 arder mushroom will work), although this is not recommended due to pestle and mortars being easily accessible via the shelf near the asylum's entrance.
