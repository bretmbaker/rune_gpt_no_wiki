Short green guys(commonly abbreviated toSGG) are drinks that can be made at level 20Cooking, granting 120 Cookingexperience. They heal 5hitpoints, boostStrengthby 5% + 1 levels, and reduceAttackby 2% - 3 levels. Short green guys are a good way to cheaply train without leaving theGnome Stronghold, since they require only one type of fruit, have cheap ingredients, and only require one chopped/sliced item.
