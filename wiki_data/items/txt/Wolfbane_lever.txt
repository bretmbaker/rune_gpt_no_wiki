TheWolfbane leverwas an unobtainable item that previously could be found in the game cache. It was created to replace an item used by Jagex moderators for testing features of theWerewolf Agility Coursecalled the "Werewolf Agility Arena helper". Since items could not be fully removed once created, the Wolfbane lever was added in a hidden update in 2005 to fill this slot.
