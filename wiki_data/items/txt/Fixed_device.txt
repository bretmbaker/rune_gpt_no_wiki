Thefixed deviceis a Gnome contraption which is used in theMourning's End Part Iquest to shoot dye onFarmer Brumty's sheep. It requires aRangedlevel of 60 to wield. It is carried on the shoulder with both hands. It uses dyed toads as ammo, which players make by fillingogre bellowswith ared,yellow,green, orblue dyeand then using the bellows on aswamp toad. Only one toad may be placed in the device at a time, and the device can only be wielded when filled with ammo. Its only attack modes are "Aim and fire", which the player uses to fire the toads at the sheep, and "Kick" which, as its name implies, is a basic kicking attack.
