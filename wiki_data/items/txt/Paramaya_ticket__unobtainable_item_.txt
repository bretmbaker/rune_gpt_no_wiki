AParamaya ticketis an unobtainable version of theParamaya ticket. Tickets could previously be traded and turned into bank notes; however, they were made untradeable in 2007 due to frequent use in scams. Any player who had a noted Paramaya ticket was given this now discontinued item. It is identical to the real ticket, except it is stackable.
