Thetanzanite helmis obtained by using atanzanite mutagenon aserpentine helm. The tanzanite helm retains the stats and abilities of the serpentine helm, the only difference being the appearance of the helmet. Like the regular helm, it cannot be equipped if it is uncharged, except when it fully degrades while being worn. In addition, players can configure the charges while the helm is in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials.
