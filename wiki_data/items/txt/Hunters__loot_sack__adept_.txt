Adept hunters' loot sacksare a reward for successfully completing adeptHunters' Rumoursassigned byGuild Hunter CervusorOrnus. Note that certain drops scale with certain skill levels such as Woodcutting and Herblore; players with a higher Woodcutting level has a better chance of obtaining a higher tier log, while players with a higher Herblore level will receive larger quantities of higher tier herbs. However, it is possible (though very unlikely) for a player with a low skill level to obtain such items (i.e. a player with Woodcutting level 30 to receive aYew log.)
