Thespeedy teleport scrollis a consumable item purchased for 600Quest Speedrunningreward points from theSpeedrunning Reward Shop, and can be freely reclaimed once purchased. It can be used to unlock a speedrunning-themedHome Teleportanimation override. To enable it, players can right click "Animation" on the Home Teleport spell icon in their spellbook and select "Speedy". The speedy home teleport is slightly faster than other home teleport animation overrides, which results in a casting time of only 18 ticks (10.8 seconds) as opposed to the standard 22 ticks (13.2 seconds).
