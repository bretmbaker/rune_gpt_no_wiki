Weapon poisonis an unobtainable item that was intended to be released with theRanging Guild, but for unknown reasons was cut before launch. Most likely, it would have been sold by theWeapon poison salesman, who was also not released. SinceWeapon poisonwas relatively difficult to obtain at the time, it is possible the developers feared making it available in a store would cause the item to become too common.
