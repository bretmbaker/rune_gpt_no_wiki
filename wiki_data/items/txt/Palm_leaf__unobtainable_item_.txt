APalm leafis an unobtainable version of thePalm leaf. Palm leaves could previously be traded and turned into bank notes; however, they were made untradeable in 2007 due to frequent use in scams. Any player who had a noted palm leaf was given this now discontinued item. It is identical to the real leaf, except it is stackable.
