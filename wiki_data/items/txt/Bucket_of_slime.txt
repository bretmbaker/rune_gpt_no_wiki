Buckets of slimeare filled with a slimy green glowing liquid,  gathered from the basement of the Ectofuntus nearPort Phasmatys.Necrovarususes this liquid to control the ghosts of Port Phasmatys, but he is thwarted by the player duringGhosts Ahoy. It apparently has hidden magical properties regarding ghosts and the undead, which is the reason Necrovarus can control the ghosts of Phasmatys and also why he, along with his disciples, are still able to interact with living beings, even after many years of death.
