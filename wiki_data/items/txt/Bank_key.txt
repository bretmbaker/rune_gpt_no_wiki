Thebank keyis aDeadman Modeitem that allows 10 of the victim's most valuable items, based onGrand Exchangevalue, to be taken. It can be obtained by killing a player. The player that obtained the key can collect the items by opening a chest in a bank within a low-threat area, which means they must wait until their skull expires or risk being killed by the guards. These bank keys cannot be deposited into a bank, and only five bank keys can be in a players possession at any given time.
