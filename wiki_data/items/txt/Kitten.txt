Kittensare young petcatsthat can follow the player. In order to obtain a pet kitten, a player must complete theGertrude's Catquest, after whichGertrudewill give them a kitten as part of the reward. The first kitten is free, and each kitten after that is 100coins, but players cannot own more than one kitten at a time. If a fully grown cat is put into theplayer-owned houseMenagerie, another kitten can be obtained from Gertrude. If players have an activatedring of charos, they are able to charm Gertrude into allowing them to choose a specific colour kitten. Otherwise, players will be given a kitten of a random colour.
