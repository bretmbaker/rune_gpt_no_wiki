TheMonkey wrenchis an unobtainable item that presumably would have been used duringMonkey Madness I. Most likely, it was intended to be another Monkey themed item, similar toMonkey barandMonkey nuts. For unknown reasons, it was scrapped early in development, and therefore reuses the inventory sprite for theEye of gnome.
