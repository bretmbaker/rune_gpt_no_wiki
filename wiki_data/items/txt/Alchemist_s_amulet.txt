Thealchemist's amuletis an item purchased from theMixology Rewardsshop with 6,900Mox resin, 5,650Aga resin, and 7,400Lye resin, which are earned from participating in theMastering Mixologyminigame. While the amulet is equipped, there is a 15% chance the player will create a potion with an extra dose when brewing potions (but with no extra experience), which consumes one charge. This effect works when adding secondaries to potions with fewer than 3 doses, such asanti-venomandstamina potions.
