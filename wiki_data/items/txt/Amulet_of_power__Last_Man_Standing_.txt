TheAmulet of poweris an unobtainable item added with theLast Man Standingbeta. Presumably, it was intended to be obtained from loot crates like theAmulet of accuracyandAmulet of glory. However, it was never actually added to the minigame, presumably as it was believed the item would be redundant given the availability of two other amulets.
