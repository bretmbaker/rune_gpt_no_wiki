The10th squadsigilis an item used to teleport to the final boss during theMonkey Madness Iquest. It will no longer teleport you to the boss fight arena after you defeat theJungle Demon. It can be safely thrown away after the quest, however it can be kept as a cosmetic item.
If lost, the sigil may be recovered by speaking toWaymottin, the gnome mage at the end of theApe Atoll Dungeon. However, if you have completedMonkey Madness II, it can be reclaimed byZooknockupstairs in the house south-west of Anita's. If lost due to death, you may reclaim it by speaking toDeath.
