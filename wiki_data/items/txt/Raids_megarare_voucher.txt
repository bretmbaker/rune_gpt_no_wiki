Theraids megarare voucheris an item that was obtainable during theRaging Echoes League. When a player normally rolls a megarare item as a drop from any of the threeraids(Chambers of Xeric,Theatre of Blood, andTombs of Amascut), they will instead receive a megarare voucher. The voucher can then be exchanged atThe SageinLumbridgeto redeem any of the three megarare items (twisted bow,scythe of Vitur, orTumeken's shadow) from any of the three raids, rather than being limited to the megarare item of that particular raid.Vials of bloodare not required to charge the scythe of Vitur, if redeemed. Instead, it can be charged withblood runesat a rate of 3 runes per charge.
