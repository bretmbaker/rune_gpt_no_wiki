Iodinewas an unobtainable item that previously could be found in the game cache. It was created to replace an item used by Jagex moderators for testing features ofMonkey Madness Icalled the "Monkey Madness helper". Since items could not be fully removed once created, Iodine was added in a hidden update in 2005 to fill this slot.
