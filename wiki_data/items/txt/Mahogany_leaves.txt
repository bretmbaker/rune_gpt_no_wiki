Mahogany leaveswere planned to be an item obtained from choppingmahogany trees. When used to brewforester's teaor burned onForester's Campfires, they add production, gathering, tertiary power, and duration effects. Without forester's tea, they would serve no purpose, and so were never added to the game.
