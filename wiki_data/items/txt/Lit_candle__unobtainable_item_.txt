Alit candleis an unobtainable version of theLit candle. Candles were previously tradeable and could be turned into banknotes. However, they were made untradeable due to an unfixable bug where trading a lit candle in a dark area would not update the lighting for either player.Any player who had a noted Lit candle was given this now discontinued item. Originally, the item was identical to the real lit candle, except being stackable.
