Bitternutsare items used in theTrouble Brewingminigame. Players can obtain the nuts from the bitternut trees found within the minigame onMos Le'Harmlessusingmonkeys, which are caught in the same area. In order to retrieve a bitternut, the player must first dye a monkey in the colour of their team usingred waterorblue water, obtained by using eitherredorblue flowerson the kettle in your team's base and then using an empty bowl on the kettle. They then can use themonkeywith the Bitternut Tree. Additionally, if you have aMonkeyspeak amulet, you can alter the strategy used. You can choose to either make the monkey angry by taunting it, or caution him. By making him angry, he'll be more inclined to get up the tree as fast as possible and start pelting you with bitternuts, speeding up the time before you get a nut. If you tell him to be careful, he'll take a little bit longer, but will be more aware of other monkeys and will be more likely to win in a confrontation. This is also the most complicated task inTrouble Brewing.
