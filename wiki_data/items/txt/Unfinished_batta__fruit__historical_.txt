Anunfinished battawas previously obtained duringGnome cookingwhen making aFruit batta. It could be made by adding four equa leaves to aHalf baked batta, then baking it. Players then could addlime chunks,orange chunks, andpineapple chunksin any order, before finally addingGnome spice. If a mistake was made at any point, anOdd battawould be received instead.
