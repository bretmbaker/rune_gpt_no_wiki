TheCamo bottomsare an unobtainable version of theCamo bottomsobtained from theDrill Demonrandom event. Originally, all pieces of Camo were tradeable, and could be turned into banknotes. However, due to players selling the pieces for very expensive prices (some up to several million) they were made untradeable 2 weeks later. Any noted versions existing ingame were transformed into this unique stackable variant.
