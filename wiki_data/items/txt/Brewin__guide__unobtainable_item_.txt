Brewin' guidesare an unobtainable item. They can be found aroundTrouble Brewingand have a "Take" option. However, when taken they will give a copy of the realBrewin' guideinstead, and the item will not despawn. Therefore, while they serve as an infinite source of Brewin' guides, the item itself is unobtainable. On March 30th 2022 there was a brief glitch that allowed players to telegrab the books, however this was shortly hotfixed.
