Antique emblemsare rewards from theBounty HunterMinigame. Unlike theirprevious version, they can only be obtained by killing your target in theWildernesson Bounty Hunter worlds. There is also a chance for the emblem to upgrade to the next Tier when killing other Players. The chance of upgrading an emblem can be increased, by killing higher level Targets, carrying higher level emblems, and by killing your Target inHotspots. There is also a silent cooldown that caps the rate at which players can receive Emblems, similar to the system used forMarks of Grace. There is also a maximum cap of 10 Bounty Hunter rewards you can gain each day. A reward is considered either a newly dropped Tier 1 Antique emblem or one of the Antique emblems in your inventory being upgraded upon killing an opponent.
