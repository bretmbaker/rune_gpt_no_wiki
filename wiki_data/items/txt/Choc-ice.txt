Choc-icecan be bought from a local vendor namedRokuhinNardah, who runsRok's Chocs Box. They are sold for 30coinseach, and heal 7Hitpointswhen eaten. If a bar of choc-ice is brought while venturing through the desert, it will automatically be consumed when thedesert heatsets in, providing both its healing effect as well as quenching the player's thirst. That said, manually eating choc-ice does not reset nor delay the onset of desert heat. Choc-ice can nevertheless come in handy as an alternative to bringingwaterskinsto the desert. Although waterskins are refillable and provide up to 4 uses each, choc-ice has the advantages of being essentially weightless and serving a dual purpose as a food. This can be particularly useful when scaling theAgility Pyramid.
