TheArceuus favour certificatewas a reward for completingThe Ascent of Arceuus. Reading this granted the player 10%Arceuusfavour, where there would be a confirmation message before doing so. Should the player have wished to use it some other time, they could destroy it (if bank space was an issue) and reclaim it fromLord Trobin Arceuus.
