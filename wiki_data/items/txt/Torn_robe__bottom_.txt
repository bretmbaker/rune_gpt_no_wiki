Torn robesare used during theSpirits of the Elidquest. In order to get them, players must search the cupboards in theElidinis StatuetteinNardah. There is no other way to get them, due to them not being tradeable. They must be repaired using aneedleandthreadto turn them into theRobe of elidinis, which the player must wear in order to enter the dungeon farther north along the river. Thecostume needlewill not work for this. The torn version cannot be worn.
