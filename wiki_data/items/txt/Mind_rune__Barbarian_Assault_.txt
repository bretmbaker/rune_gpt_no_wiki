Mind runesare a variant of normalmind runeswhich can be obtained from the Attacker item machine when playing the Attacker role inBarbarian Assault. To prevent any glitches where players may be able to take runes outside of the minigame and sell them for profit, the machine gives untradeable runes that have no value. Normally, they will disappear if the player attempts to take them outside.
