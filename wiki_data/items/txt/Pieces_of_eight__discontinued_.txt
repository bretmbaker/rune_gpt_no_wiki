Pieces of eightwere acurrencyearned from theTrouble Brewingminigameused to buy rewards fromHonest Jimmy's House of Stuff. During a game of Trouble Brewing, each resource deposited (i.e. buckets of water, bowls of coloured water, etc.) and opponent equipment burned (i.e. pipes, pump, etc.) would result in a piece of eight being awarded at the end of the game, up to 100 pieces of eight. Each bottle of rum deposited by the player's team gave 2 extra pieces to each player on the team at the end of the game. Pieces of eight awarded for bottling rum did not count towards the 100 pieces of eight limit for resources and sabotage, making it possible for players to earn more than 100 pieces of eight in a single game.
