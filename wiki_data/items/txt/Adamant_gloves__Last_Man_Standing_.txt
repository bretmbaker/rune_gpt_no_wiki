Adamant glovesare an unobtainable item added with theLast Man Standingbeta. Presumably, they were intended to be obtained from loot crates likeMithril glovesandRune gloves. However, it was never actually added to the minigame, presumably as it was believed the item would be redundant given the availability of two other pairs of gloves.
