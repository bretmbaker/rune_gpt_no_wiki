Aheat-proof vesselis a water container given to the player byPetrified Peteupon entering theVolcanic Mine. It can be equipped in the weapon slot. It has 36 uses per game, and can be used to throw water onto the lava, creating platforms which players can walk on. These platforms will melt after 90 seconds, giving players limited time to stand on them. If players remain on the hardened lava when it melts, they will fall into the lava, taking massive damage.
