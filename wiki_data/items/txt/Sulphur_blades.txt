Sulphur bladesare a two-handed weapon that requires level 55Attackto wield, obtained as a rare drop fromsulphur naguainNeypotzli.  Like its crush-equivalent, theGlacial temotli, it performs two independently rolled hits per attack. The maximum damage of each hit is determined by calculating the combined max hit as normal and dividing it by two. If the combined max hit is odd, one max hit is rounded up while the other is rounded down (e.g., 45 â†’ 22 + 23).
