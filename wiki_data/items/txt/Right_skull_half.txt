Aright skull halfis one of 4 parts needed to make askull sceptre, and can be found by killing aMinotauron the first level of theStronghold of Security, the Vault of War. These minotaurs can be either low or high level and are notaggressive. It is combined with aleft skull halfto make astrange skull. Doing so will result in a chatbox message stating:"The two halves of the skull fit perfectly, they appear to have a fixing point, perhaps they are to be mounted on something?"It cannot be traded, bought or sold. It is a fairly uncommon drop, as are the other pieces of the sceptre. It seems to have the highest drop rate of any of the pieces of the sceptre. You can also get more than one skull half at a time, without using thedrop trick. Interestingly, the skull half looks like that of anAnkou, while theleft skull halvesdropped by Ankous seem to be minotaur skulls.
