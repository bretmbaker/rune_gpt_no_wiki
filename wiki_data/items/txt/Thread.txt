Threadis used along with aneedleto make armour out ofleather,dragon leatherandcured yak-hide. Each thread spool has 5 uses before it is consumed. A "use" means an action performed, not number of leathers used (e.g. making vambraces, which use 1 hide each, consumes thread at the same rate as making chaps, which use 2 hides each). After completion ofDeath on the Isle, aCostume needlecan be used for crafting without needing thread.
