Theancient wyvern shieldis a magicalshieldrequiring aMagiclevel of 70 and aDefencelevel of at least 75 to equip, as well as having startedDragon Slayer I. It is one of the best Magic shields in the game, with stats comparable to that of thearcane spirit shieldwhen fully charged, although it only has a 2%Magic damagebonus while having negativeMeleeandRangedattack bonuses. However, it provides far superior stab and slash defence.
