TheWilderness capeswere items worn by the champions of each team during theWilderness Wars. They were used to show team membership and to identify who was the champion amongst the 50 team members. While the capes are identical to the normal Wilderness capes sold byRichard, the champions' capes featured a glow around the feet.
