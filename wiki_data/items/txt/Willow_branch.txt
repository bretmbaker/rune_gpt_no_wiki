Willow branchesare used for weavingbasketson aloom. They can be obtained by usingsecateurson awillowthat has fully grown in atree patch, using theFarmingskill. Branches will begin growing after you check the health of the willow tree. The tree will produce one willow branch every 5 minutes, up to a maximum of 6 at a time. This means that if you wait for more than 30 minutes, you will only be able to cut 6 before having to wait 5 minutes to cut another. Occasionally, it may be possible for a branch to regrow while in the process of cutting branches, resulting in 7 branches from a single harvest. Because branches have no visual indication of being grown, this is not immediately obvious.
