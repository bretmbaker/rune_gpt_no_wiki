Awooden shieldis the weakestshieldavailable, but one of a small group with noAttackordefencepenalties to any form of combat. It is round in shape, and while all warriors should quickly progress to something better (such as aniron kiteshield, which can also be equipped at 1 Defence), it is better than nothing for magic users, since it has no penalties. It can be purchased fromCassie's Shield ShopinFalador, found north of theVarrockcity wall as a respawn, and one is given free onTutorial Island.
