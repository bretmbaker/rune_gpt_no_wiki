Forester's rationsare a stackable item used inWoodcutting. When in the inventory or stored in aForestry kit, a player wielding or having afelling axein their inventory (as the highest or equal-highest-tier axe, if multiple axes are carried) will receive 10% more Woodcutting experience each time they successfully chop a tree and gain a 20% chance not to receive a log. One ration is consumed each time a tree is successfully chopped with a felling axe (meaning Woodcutting experience is received), whether or not logs are gathered. When this happens, a game message in the chatbox will stateYou consume a Forester's ration to fuel a mighty chop. You strike a clean cut without gathering any material.
