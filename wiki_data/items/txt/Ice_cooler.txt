Ice coolerscan be purchased from anySlayer master, and are used to finish offdesert lizardsthat have less than 5Hitpoints. When used, the lizard shudders  and collapses from the freezing water, consuming the ice cooler. Using an ice cooler on a desert lizard with 5 or more Hitpoints has no effect but will still consume an ice cooler. It is recommended to bring an excess due to the possibility of wasting coolers.
