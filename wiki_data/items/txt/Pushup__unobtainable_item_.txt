Pushupis an unobtainable item that can be seen in the chatbox during theDrill Demonrandom event, giving the player instructions on which exercise to do. The event had been taken out of the game in late 2006 as it was somewhat confusing to players; it was re-added to the game in March 2007 with new instructions and the outer area fenced off.
