"Enjifern"was the name originally given to an unobtainable item that exists in the game cache. It was created to replace the noted form of thedisplay tea, which was made untradeable. Since items could not be fully removed once created, Enjifern was added in a hidden update in 2005 to fill this slot. The actual item is just a copy of a pink skirt.
