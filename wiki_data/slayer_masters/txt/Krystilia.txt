Krystiliais aSlayer masterfound inEdgeville's jail north-east of thebank. When spoken to, she expresses her love formagicand the Wilderness, and claims the guards locked her in the cell for trouble-making.

Players can speak to her to change theirrespawnpoint to Edgeville for a one-time fee of 5,000,000coins.

Slayer[edit|edit source]

She is a Slayer master who assigns the playermonstersfound within theWilderness.Onlykills within the Wilderness count towards her tasks. Before being assigned a Wilderness task, she will warn you that she will assignanymonster regardless of your combat level.

Unlike other slayer masters, Krystilia's tasks have a separate counter from the normal slayer masters, thus players must complete five tasks from her to begin their Wilderness point streak. Despite using two different counters, playerscannothave both a normal and Wilderness slayer task at the same time. However, if the player is given a task they do not want and cannot skip it, they can go toTuraelto remove it (provided that he cannot assign it), though this will remove the Wilderness task streak and require players to complete another five tasks from her to start gaining points again.

For a kill to count towards a Krystilia task, the player must be physically located inside the Wilderness when the monster's death occurs. A player who is using adwarf multicannonwill receive the standard "As your slayer task is from Krystilia, you can only perform it inside the Wilderness" message if they teleport out of the Wilderness to restock and remain outside of it when their cannon kills the monster. The safe zone buffer immediately outside theFerox Enclavecounts as the Wilderness for task purposes, but the Enclave itself does not. Thus a player using thepool of refreshmentto resupply will not receive credit for the kill if they are inside the Enclave.

In return for completing her tasks in the Wilderness, players will have a chance to roll forLarran's keyandSlayer's enchantmentdrops. Due to the nature of the Wilderness and the varying location(s) of the assigned monster(s), it is recommended that players do not bring items they are not willing to lose, as it is possible to be killed at any time from other players. She also awards significantly more slayer points than any other master.

Completion of a task assigned by Krystiliafrom 5th task streak and beyondwill grant:

Task interval | Points given

Every task | 25

Every 10th | 125

Every 50th | 375

Every 100th | 625

Every 250th | 875

Every 1,000th | 1,250

Note:Krystilia's taskscannotbe stored using the Task Storage unlock from theSlayer Rewardsshop.
