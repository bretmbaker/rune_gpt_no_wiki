Monkey Madness II[edit|edit source]

InMonkey Madness II, she is recruited by the player to stopGloughand his experiments from wreaking havoc after his airship crashed north of theTree Gnome Stronghold. Nieve helps the player against thetortured gorillasinvading the Stronghold.

After the10th Squadsecures the Stronghold, she, along with the player, pursues Glough in theCrash Site Cavern, where she assists the player in defeating Glough's tortured anddemonic gorillas. After Glough drinks the serum to mutate himself, Nieve charges at him, despite the player's warnings. The mutated Glough easily bats Nieve aside before stomping the ground, causing a boulder to fall and kill her. The player ultimately avenges Nieve's death.

After the quest, hergravestonecan be found between the small swamp and theGrand Tree's north-western entrance, next to the exit that leads to the Crash Site Cavern. Her gravestone also functions as the player'skill countfor tortured and demonic gorillas. Her younger cousin,Steve, replaces her as theSlayer Master, and Steve's younger sisterPievereplaces him at theAsgarnian Ice Dungeon.
