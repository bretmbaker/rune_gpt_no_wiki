Turaelis the lowest levelSlayer Master, along with his daughterSpria. Turael resides inBurthorpe; the fastest way to reach him is toteleporttoBurthorpe Games Roomusing agames necklaceand running east to Turael's house, just south of the general store.

There are no level requirements to receiveSlayer tasksfrom him.

Additionally, Turael is capable of changing your Slayer task from another master into a less difficult one. If the other master has assigned you a task Turael could assign himself, your request will not work. Moreover, he will issue a changeonly onceper task type.Warning: After a task change is processed, yourtask streakwill also be reset to zero.

Because the tasks he assigns are relatively easy, players often use Turael to boost theirSlayer reward points. This is accomplished by completing every 50th task with a Slayer master that gives a lot of points per task, such asKonar quo Maten, and using Turael for the rest of the tasks to get to every interval of 50 more quickly. You can do this every 10 tasks instead but this is not recommended due to the amount of unfavourable tasks that can be given, unless you use a different Slayer master (other than Konar).

After the events ofWhile Guthix Sleeps, he is replaced with his sisterAya.
