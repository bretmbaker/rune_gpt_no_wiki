Vannakais a highly accomplished fighter who serves as theCombat InstructoronTutorial Islandand aSlayer masterinEdgeville Dungeon. He claims to be the greatest swordsman alive, which is suggested by hiscombat levelof 146 and his ability to carry both asteel two-handed swordanddragon square shieldat the same time, a trait unattainable by players. According to the14thPostbag from the Hedge, hisStrengthlevel is 112.

During the tutorial, he dismisses the player character's attempts at making idle conversation, and proceeds to teach them howMeleeandRangedcombatwork. He tasks the player withslayingagiant ratin close combat. Afterwards, he instructs the player to kill a second rat from outside of the enclosure usingrangedattacks, a strategy colloquially known assafespotting.

Vannaka gives the player abronze sword, awooden shield, ashortbow, and somebronze arrowsto keep as part of his lessons on the island.

When encountered after the tutorial, Vannaka acts as a mid-level Slayer Master. He is found due east of theWildernessentrance within the Edgeville Dungeon, and is marked by a Slayer Master icon on theminimap. Players withCombat level40 or higher may receiveSlayer tasksfrom him.
