Konar quo Maten(translated asKonar the Hunter) is aSlayer masterwho is found in theKahlithsettlement on the summit ofMount Karuulm. Players must have acombat levelof at least 75 to be assigned aSlayer taskfrom her.

She is the only Slayer master who can assign bothhydrasas a normal slayer task and theAlchemical Hydraas a boss slayer task.

Getting there[edit|edit source]

Rada's blessing 3or4's teleport takes players to the summit ofMount Karuulm.Heading north of theCIRfairy ringNorth of theFarming Guildteleport (found on theSkills necklace/Farming cape)North of theBattlefront teleport.Using theNPC Contactspell. Konar is initially unavailable using NPC Contact and must be spoken to first using Talk-to before becoming an option. The right-click "Assignment" option willnotunlock her in NPC contact.

Slayer points[edit|edit source]

Players can receiveSlayer reward pointsfor completingSlayer tasks—this is based on how many tasks players have accomplished in a row. Completion of a task assigned by Konar will grant players a varying amount of points, depending if they have completed theKourend & Kebos Diary. Although she is the third highest Slayer master, she gives the second highest slayer point reward per task due to requiring players to slay in a specific area. The only Slayer master who gives more points isKrystilia, who gives Slayer tasks in theWilderness.

Task interval | Points given

Default | Elite Diary

Every task | 18 | 20

Every 10th | 90 | 100

Every 50th | 270 | 300

Every 100th | 450 | 500

Every 250th | 630 | 700

Every 1,000th | 900 | 1,000

Tasks[edit|edit source]

Unlike other Slayer masters, Konar'sSlayer tasksalso include a specific location where players must complete the entire task.

After a task has been rolled, a second roll is made to determine the location in which Konar wants the player to complete their assignment. This second roll will check any other additional requirements if a location is locked behind a quest. If the player has not completed the quest that unlocks the respective area, then the task will never be directed there; e.g. a player who has not completedSong of the Elveswould not be offeredwaterfiendsat theIorwerth Dungeon, whereas one who did would have that as a potential location. The chance of being assigned a specific location is equal for each eligible location,[1]barring theWildernessunless it is part of a boss task (e.g.Vet'iontask), sinceKrystiliaspecializes in that area. Due to this, players who are seeking variants of monsters (such asdemonic gorillasorTormented Demons) should use other slayer masters, as they are not eligible for Konar tasks.

Bosses located in that area will also count towards the task;Cerberuscan be killed in place of normal hellhounds should she assign them toTaverley Dungeon.

In return for killing the assigned monsters at the location Konar specifies, players have a chance of receiving abrimstone key, which can be used to open thebrimstone chestnext to her.

Lastly, theSlayer capeperk gives a 10% chance to be reassigned the same monster for a player's task, including the same location.
