[Passive Effect]
The shield's passive effect.
The elysian spirit shield has a 70% chance of reducing the damage the player receives by 25%. On average, this results in a 17.5% overall damage reduction. The passive effect stacks with theJusticiar armourset effect.
The passive effect does not work against all sources of damage: certain monster special attacks (such asdragonfire) as well as non-combat damage (such aspoison) are unaffected.
Opponents' healing effects such as theenchanted onyx bolteffect orGuthan's setare not reduced and will heal the full amount, even if the passive effect takes place. Recoil damage, such asVengeance, is applied after the damage reduction.
If damage would have been taken when the effect activates, a minimum of 1 is reduced, even if the original hit would have been 1. This makes the shield especially useful against monsters such as theKrakenas itstentaclesonly have a maximum hit of 2 yet hit often.[1]
