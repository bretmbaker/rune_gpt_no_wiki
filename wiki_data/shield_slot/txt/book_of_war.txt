[Weapon: Book Of War]


Thebook of waris a book held in place of a shield, and is thegod bookaligned withBandos. It can be purchased fromJossikfor5,000 coinsat theLighthouse. Books of war must be made using all four tornBandos pageswhich can be purchased from other players or obtained fromTreasure Trails. Equipping a book of war allows the player to preach and perform ceremonies, such as blessing, last rites, and wedding rites, by operating it (none of which have any effect on the game itself, and are simply recited lines of text), costing 25% of the player'sspecial attackenergy.
Lost books of war can be reclaimed by speaking toJossik, complete with all pages that have been added, for no cost. Alternatively, for those who do not wish to travel to the Lighthouse,Perduwill return them to players for14,000 coins.
