It is created at theVolcanic Forgein theWildernesswith anodium shard 1,odium shard 2, andodium shard 3, dropped by theChaos Fanatic,Crazy archaeologist, andScorpia, respectively.
Theward upgrade kit, purchased fromJustine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standing, cosmetically enhances the odium ward, creating anodium ward (or). This only alters its appearance and makes it untradeable. This can be reverted but the kitwill notbe returned.
