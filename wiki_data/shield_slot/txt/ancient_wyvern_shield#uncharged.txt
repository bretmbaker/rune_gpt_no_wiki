[Weapon: Ancient Wyvern Shield#Uncharged]


Theancient wyvern shieldis a magicalshieldrequiring aMagiclevel of 70 and aDefencelevel of at least 75 to equip, as well as having startedDragon Slayer I. It is one of the best Magic shields in the game, with stats comparable to that of thearcane spirit shieldwhen fully charged, although it only has a 2%Magic damagebonus while having negativeMeleeandRangedattack bonuses. However, it provides far superior stab and slash defence.
The shield provides bothdragonfireprotection and greater protection against the icy breath ofwyverns. Unlike theelemental,mind, anddragonfire shields, the ancient wyvern shield will also grant an immunity against the freezing effect from a wyvern'sicy breath, as well as reducing the damage. This immunity, on the other hand,does notextend to any otherfreezing effect(such asKBD,Vorkath, etc).
