[Weapon: Adamant Defender#Broken]


Theadamant defenderis adefendermade out ofadamant. It can be obtained by killingcyclopeson the top floor of theWarriors' Guildafter you have shown amithril defendertoKamfreena. It is held in the shield slot and requires 30AttackandDefenceto wield. It is recommended for players to keep the adamant defender in case they are to lose theirrune defender, as having no other defenders would force them to restart at bronze. Collecting more than one rune ordragondefender also solves this problem.
If the player dies below level 20Wilderness, it will remain in the player's inventory. However, the item will be unusable and must be repaired with 25,000 coins by using the item onPerdu.
