[Weapon: Defensive Shield]


Thedefensive shieldis a two-handedShieldused during theWarriors' Guildcatapult activity. It is acquired by talking toGamfredon the1stfloor[UK]2ndfloor[US]of the Warriors' Guild. It can only be equipped while standing on the target in the activity room, and moving away from that square will unequip the shield. This activity is a slower tactic of obtaining warrior guild tokens compared to killingAnimated Armour.
The shield has 4 defensive options: stab, blunt, slash and magic. Successfully defending against the correct attack type awards a player with 10Defenceexperienceand 1warrior guild token. While the shield is equipped, the defensive options interface will appear automatically. The quest, prayer, magic, options, emotes, and music menus will be hidden.
