It records nearly every unique drop the player has obtained from various content inOld School RuneScape. The player does not need to have claimed a collection log for it to start tracking drops.
Drops obtained prior to its release are not automatically recorded for any player, excluding untradeable items (such aspets) provided that they can be tracked by the game; for example,long bonesthe player had traded toBarlakor buried before the log's release were not added to it, but any long bones in the player's possession were added.Ironmanplayers are able to add some items collected prior to the release by using the item on the collection log item; this does not apply toGroup Ironmanplayers.
