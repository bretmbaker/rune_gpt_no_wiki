Low Level Alchemy(also known aslow alchorLA) is autility spellavailable in the standard spellbook. It requires level 21Magicto cast, and grants 31 Magicexperienceper cast.

Casting Low Level Alchemy on an item in the player's inventory will convert that item into a number ofcoinsequal to 40% of the item'svalue(not the item'sGrand Exchangeprice).

Players with level 55 Magic are generally recommended to useHigh Level Alchemyinstead, as it provides more coins and experience per cast than Low Level Alchemy. However, there are situations where Low Level Alchemy can be more effective (see below).

While in theAlchemist's PlaygroundofMage Training Arena, Low Level Alchemy requires 5 game ticks to cast, rather than the usual three.

Casting Low Level Alchemy at theFountain of Runeis a requirement for theeasy Wilderness Diary.

Cost[edit|edit source]

TheExplorer's ring 1can be used to cast Low Level Alchemy up to 30 times per day without requiring any runes; however, no experience is granted.

It is possible to cast this spell at the Fountain of Rune, requiring no runes, resulting in greater profit, however no experience is granted. Like most activities in theWilderness, this is attempted at one's own risk.

Comparison with High Level Alchemy[edit|edit source]

Available at level 55 Magic, High Level Alchemy has a similar rune cost to Low Level Alchemy but provides 50% more coins and over twice as much Magic experience per cast. However, High Level Alchemy requires five game ticks to cast (up to 1,200 casts per hour) compared to Low Level Alchemy's three game ticks (up to 2,000 casts per hour).

Players wishing to train Magic via alchemy should use High Level Alchemy once they have access to it, since the increased experience per cast outweighs the slower casting speed. Similarly, players who just want to convert some of their items into gold (such as excessRune armourdrops frommonsters) should use High Level Alchemy due to its increased coin yield per item.

Players wishing to quickly convert a large amount of items into coins may want to consider using Low Level Alchemy, as it can convert more items into gold per hour than High Level Alchemy, although the gold obtained per item is lower. However, Low Level Alchemy also uses moreNature runesper hour than High Level Alchemy, so players should consider the cost of Nature runes when deciding which spell to use.
