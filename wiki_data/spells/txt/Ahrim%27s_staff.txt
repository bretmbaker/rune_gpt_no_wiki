Ahrim's staffis a one-handedmagic weaponthat is part ofAhrim the Blighted's set. To wield Ahrim's staff, the player must have 70Magicand 70Attack. It increasesMagic damageby 5%.

If Ahrim's staff is wielded along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Ahrim's barrows set, the player's successful magic attacks have a chance of temporarily lowering the opponent'sStrengthlevel. This is cumulative with other effects that lower strength, namely the spellEnfeeble.

It is able toautocastStandard combat spellsas well as being one of the few weapons able toautocastArceuus combat spells. Additionally, wearing Ahrim's set with anAmulet of the damnedwill allow players toautocastAncient Magicks, and also grant players a 25% chance of dealing a hit with 30% increased damage.

Degradation[edit|edit source]

Barrows equipmentdegradesas it is used. Equipment received from theBarrowsreward chest is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g.Ahrim's staff. It will becomeAhrim's staff 100the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade toAhrim's staff 75, then50, then25and finally0at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded.

When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment willautomatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. As abank note, dropping will not break the equipment.

There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using anarmour standin anyplayer-owned house. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded.

The following NPCs can repair the armour:

Bob- the axe seller inLumbridgeTindel Marchant- the weapon and armour repairman atPort KhazardDunstan- the smith inBurthorpeSquire- in the workshop area of theVoid Knights' Outpost
