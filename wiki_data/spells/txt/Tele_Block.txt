Tele Blockis aspellthat requires aMagiclevel of 85 and can only be cast on another player in theWilderness.

When used, if itsuccessfully hitsthe target, a large purple sphere will emerge and collide to the target. The target will also be notified of the Tele Block landing on them with the messageA Tele Block has been cast on you by [player name]. It will expire in [time].The default duration of the Tele Block is 5 minutes, but if the target hadProtect from Magicup before it was cast and landed, it will be reduced by 50% to 2 minutes and 30 seconds. While Tele Blocked, the player will be unable to use any form ofteleportation, including theWilderness Obelisksand various teleport levers, such as the ones in theDeserted Keep,Mage ArenaandKing Black Dragon Lair. They will also be unable to enter theCorporeal Beast's cave or theFerox Enclave. Once Tele Blocked, the player is immune from further attempts until the current one expires. The player is briefly immune after the Tele Block wears off, though an observant player can quickly apply another one if timed properly.

There are various ways to remove the Tele Block:

Kill the player who cast the Tele Block. When this occurs, the message "Your Tele Block has been removed because you killed [player name]." Forcing them to leave the Wilderness does not count.Leave the Wilderness by any means - jump over theWilderness DitchordyingLogging out, assuming the player is able to gap their attacker(s).

In the Wilderness, the runes can be substituted with aBlighted teleport spell sack.
