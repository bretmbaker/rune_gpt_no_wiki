Superheat Itemis autility spellavailable in thestandard spellbook. It requires level 43Magicto cast, and grants 53 Magic experience per cast. It allows players tosmeltoreintobarswithout afurnace. Itcannotbe cast on noted ore.

Casting the spell on a piece of ore in the player'sinventoryrequires the sameSmithinglevel as smelting the bar at a furnace, along with the appropriate amount of coal. Each bar made yields the same amount of Smithing experience as would be gained from smelting the bar at a furnace. The experience-boosting effect of thegoldsmith gauntletsorSmithing capeis applied when casting Superheat Item.

Casting Superheat Item oniron orewith at least twocoalalways produces asteel bar, otherwise it produces aniron barwith a 100% chance of success. This is comparable to aring of forging, used to increase the furnace smelting rate from 50% to 100%. Assuming astaff of fireis used, it is more profitable to use a ring of forging by107.32coinsper bar.

Casting Superheat Itemdoeswork in conjunction withsmithing catalyst, providing the catalyst's usual effects of halving coal consumption and doubling the experience gain for the ore it was cast on.
