Failed Cursing[edit|edit source]

Casting Curse while wearing fullmetal armour(including anelemental staffwith no more than +10 magic points) and d'hidevambracescan give a magic attack as low as -65, which guarantees a "splash," or a missed hit. This provides very cheap Magic experience, as players can instantly recast the spell on the same target. Additionally, casting Curse grants players no experience in theHitpointsskill and, thus, is useful topures. The usual method is to buy the Body runes needed for the cast, as well as an appropriate amount of one of the other two runes, and using the respective staff of the third rune. An expensive alternative is to buy aMud battlestaff, which provides an unlimited supply of both Water and Earth runes.Snakeskin bootsare also a recommended item to bring when splashing as they give an additional -10 magic attack.

When doing this method, it is helpful to position a monster so that it is just on the edge of your screen, so that there is minimal distance between it and your spellbook.
