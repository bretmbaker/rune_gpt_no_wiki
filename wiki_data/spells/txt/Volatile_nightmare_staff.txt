Special attack[edit|edit source]

The volatile nightmare staff has aspecial attack,Immolate, that consumes 55% of the player's special attack energy to hit the target with 50% increased accuracy and deals a high amount of damage. The special attack does not consume runes.

When calculating the max hit, Immolate acts like any other spell. The spell's max hit is calculated first and then rounded down (known in mathematics as "floor"). Allmagic damagegear, including the +15% from the staff is calculated separately. Because the staff has a magic damage bonus, the max hit seen in-game will always be higher than the spell's max hit. The max hit varies with visible Magic level according to the formula below.[1]The spell's max hit is limited to, at most, 58. This means that even though the max hit is based on the player's magic level,boostingabove magic level 98 will not increase the max hit. It can be increased though by using additional magic damage gear including theSlayer helmet (i)when on aslayer task.
