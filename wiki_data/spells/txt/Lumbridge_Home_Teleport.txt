Lumbridge Home Teleportis thehome teleporton thestandard spellbook. It provides players with a free transport every half an hour toLumbridge, it is similar in most respects toLumbridge Teleport. This spell was originally added to thespellbookas a way for players to teleport out if their characters were stuck and unable to move. Prior to this addition, the player would have had to contact aJagex Moderatorto teleport them out.

Home teleport has no level requirements in order to be used, allowing players who are low levelled or have had their stats drained access to it.

Casting the spell takes around fourteen seconds, and can be interrupted bycombat. It also cannot be used while in combat. Like mostteleport spells, the spell cannot be cast beyond level 20Wilderness. Unlike other teleport spells, it cannot be cast in the cell in theH.A.M. Hideout. Additionally, it cannot be cast within certain areas of the grounds ofDraynor Manor. The spell may only be used every 30 minutes: if a player tries to cast it before 30 minutes have elapsed, they are notified with the remaining time in minutes.

This cooldown is shared with that of other home teleports. Switching spell book will not allow you to use a different home teleport spell until 30 minutes has elapsed.

As with all home teleports, the Lumbridge Home Teleport default animation can be overridden with an alternativeanimation, if unlocked.
