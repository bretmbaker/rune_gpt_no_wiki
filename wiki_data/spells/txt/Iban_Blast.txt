Iban Blastis acombat spellthat can be cast at 50Magicwhile on the standard spellbook.  WithoutMagic damageboosts, it can inflict up to 25 damage. Because of its very high max hit compared to other spells on the standard spellbook, it is often recommended for casters in situations where another staff is not required.

To cast this spell, the player must be wieldingIban's staff; thus, the player must completeUnderground Passand have level 50Attackin order to be able to cast this spell. Each cast consumes one charge from Iban's staff when cast on an NPC, or two charges if cast on another player. Thus this spell can be cast a total of 120 times (60 inPvP) before the staff must be recharged. This is increased to 2,500 (1,250 in PvP) withIban's upgraded staff.

This spell may beautocastwith Iban's staff.

Enter the cave and climb down the well. Make your way to the throne room and open the doors. Use your staff on the well and it will be recharged for free.
