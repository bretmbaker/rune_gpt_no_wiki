Special attack[edit|edit source]

The eldritch nightmare staff has aspecial attack,Invocate, that consumes 55% of the player's special attack energy to hit the target for a high amount of magic damage, also restoring the caster'sprayer pointsby 50% of the damage dealt.Invocatecan boost the caster's prayer points above their natural prayer level, up to a maximum of 120.

The Prayer restoration fromInvocateis calculated from the potential damage of a hit before some types of damage immunities are applied. This can allow it to restore prayer even if a monster appears to take zero damage. For example,kuraskscan only be harmed by leaf-bladed weaponry,broad bolts, or theMagic Dartspell, but ifInvocatewould have otherwise hit a 40 before immunity, the restoration effect still takes place for 20 prayer points. This mechanic also applies if the target has less total health than the potential damage of the attack. If a target with only 2 hitpoints remaining is struck with anInvocatethat would have dealt 60 damage, the attacker will still have 30 prayer points restored.

Utility[edit|edit source]

Players often use the Eldritch nightmare staff's special attack as a supplement, or replacement for prayer supplies on an extended trip. This can be done with the staff as a primary weapon, or swapping to it when special attack energy is available.  It can be particularly cost saving on slayer tasks that require protection prayers. BecauseInvocatemust successfully hit a target to restore prayer points, quickly turning on accuracy boosts likeMystic MightorAugurybefore casting the special attack becomes a strategy that pays for itself in prayer restoration.

Special attack energy naturally recharges at the rate of 10% every 30 seconds,  allowing one restoration from the Eldritch nightmare staff every 180 seconds(3 minutes)of recharge. TheLightbearerring doubles natural energy regeneration speed, reducing it to 90 seconds(1.5 minutes)of recharge between special attacks. Players with a sufficiently high prayer bonus andLightbearer, can easily useInvocateto sustainprotect-fromprayers without potions, indefinitely.

This staff is a popular choice to use at theInfernoto conserve supplies. Combined with theLightbeareranddivine rune pouch, it is considered highly inventory efficient compared to other potential weapons. While its special attack allows for very effective prayer restoration, players seeking similar methods of health restoration should consider theSaradomin godswordorToxic blowpipe.

During the fight againstThe Nightmare,Invocateinflicts double damage upon the totems, potentially restoring very large amounts of prayer points all at once.

Max hit[edit|edit source]

When calculating the max hit,Invocateacts like a standard magic spell. The spell has an internal max hit, which is calculated first based on a player's visiblemagiclevel, and rounded down; Then allmagic damagegear, including the +15% from the staff itself, is calculated separately. Because the staff has a magic damage bonus, the max hit seen in-game will always be higher than the spell's internal max hit.

Invocate's base damage stops scaling at a visible player magic level of 97. This means that boosting your magic above this level will not increase the internal ceiling of 44 damage. HoweverInvocate's damage will still be increased through additional magic damage gear, or items like theSlayer helmet (i)when on aslayer task.

The max hit varies with visible Magic level according to the formula below.

Spell Max Hit=min⁡{⌊44*Magic Level99+1⌋,44}Staff Max Hit=⌊Spell Max Hit*1.15⌋

Other notes[edit|edit source]

Invocategrants the player 10 magic experience when cast, and an additional 2 experience per damage dealt.

The special attack will only damage enemies with flying type immunities, likeAviansieif an autocast spell has been selected. Having a melee attack style selected will return the message "The Aviansie is flying too high for you to attack using melee."

Unlike theancient mace's special attack, using it against acombat dummyin aplayer-owned housecombat roomwill notresult in any prayer points restored.
