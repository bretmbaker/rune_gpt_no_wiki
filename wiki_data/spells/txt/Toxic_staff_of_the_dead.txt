Special attack[edit|edit source]

The staff has aspecial attack,Power of Death, that halves all of the opponent'smeleedamage, consuming 100% of the player's special attack energy. Upon activating the special attack, a message will appear in the player's chatbox: "Spirits of deceased evildoers offer you their protection."

The effect lasts for one minute after using the special attack, but is immediately lost if players unequip the staff. In addition, the effect stacks with the PvP damage reduction effect of theProtect from Meleeprayer.

Creation[edit|edit source]

Charging[edit|edit source]

The staff can always be used to cast spells, however whenchargedthe staff provides a+8 magic attack bonusand achance to inflictvenomon opponents struck by the staff or by spells cast while wielding it. Similar toSerpentine helm, the staff will immediately use 10 scales when the player enters combat and will use another 10 if the player is still in combat after a minute has passed. A continuous hour of combat uses 600 scales, costing151,800 coinsper hour or2,530 coinsper minute.

Resource | Cost per charge

1 xZulrah's scales | 253

Total cost per charge | 253

Fully charging the staff with 11,000Zulrah's scalescosts2,783,000 coins. Players can configure the charges while the weapon is in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials.

Modifying the staff by removing the fang, or trading the staff to other players is only possible while the staff is uncharged. Players may uncharge the staff at any time to recover all unused scales.

If a player dies with the staff inPvPscenarios and it is not protected, any scales that were used to charge it will appear on the floor along with the uncharged staff.
