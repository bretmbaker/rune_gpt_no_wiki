Trivia[edit|edit source]

Prior toan update on May 29, 2024, Fire Strike had the highest base maximum hit out of all the strike spells. For this reason, it was commonly used by low-level players to defeat enemies and quest bosses with a much higher combat level, such as theKhazard warlordin theTree Gnome Villagequest. After the update, all of the strike spells have a base maximum hit equal to the strongest strike spell that the player has unlocked, makingWind Strikea cheaper but equally effective alternative (unless the player is fighting a monster that is specificallyweak to fire spells).
