Thestaff of the deadis abladed staffthat requires 75Magicand 75Attackto wield. It is dropped byK'ril Tsutsaroth, and counts as aZamorakian itemwhile in theGod Wars Dungeonand in the desertBandit camp. It is one of several one-handed staves which boost magic damage by 15%.

When a combat spell is cast with the staff, there is a 1/7 (~14.2%) chance that the staff will negate the rune cost for that spell.[1]

The staff canautocastFlames of Zamorak,Crumble Undead,Magic Dart, elemental combat spells from theStandard spellbook, and combat spells from theArceuus spellbook. It is not, however, able to autocast ancient magicks.

Being a bladed staff, it is notable for its offensive melee stats, which are unusually high for a Magic weapon. Its stats slightly surpass that of adragon scimitarwhile having the same attack speed when using melee. However, when using magic spells, it offers an attack speed of 5.

The staff may beupgradedinto thetoxic staff of the dead, thestaff of light, or thestaff of balance.

Special attack[edit|edit source]

The staff has aspecial attack,Power of Death, that halves all of the opponent'smeleedamage, consuming 100% of the player's special attack energy. Upon activating the special attack, a message will appear in the player's chatbox:Spirits of deceased evildoers offer you their protection.

The effect lasts for one minute after using the special attack, but is inactive while the staff is unequipped during that minute, until the staff is equipped again. Re-equipping the staff before taking damage from another source will still reduce incoming damage until the effect runs out. In addition, the effect stacks with the PvP damage reduction effect of theProtect from Meleeprayer. The effectdoes notstack with itself should the player manage to cast the effect more than once before the initial cast expires.

Upgrading[edit|edit source]

Players with level 59Craftingcan attach amagic fangto the staff using achisel, creating atoxic staff of the dead. This enhances its magic attack bonus by +8, and has the ability to infect a target withvenom. However, taking advantage of these benefits requires usingZulrah's scalesto charge the staff. Targets can only be infected withvenomwhile using a magic attack, but using both melee and magic attacks will consumeZulrah's scales.

Alternatively, players can useSaradomin's lighton the staff of the dead to create thestaff of light, which inherits the effects of the staff of the dead. This process isirreversible. The only differences between the two staves is that the staff of light is able to autocastSaradomin Strikeinstead ofFlames of Zamorak, isunableto castArceuus combat spells, and it counts as both a Zamorakian and a Saradominist item while in theGod Wars Dungeonand in theDesert Bandit Camp.

Players can bring a Staff of the dead andGuthixian icontoJunato upgrade it to thestaff of balance. This process isirreversible. The only differences between the two staves is that the staff of balance is able to autocastClaws of Guthixinstead ofFlames of Zamorak, isunableto castArceuus combat spells, and it counts as both a Zamorakian and a Guthixian item while in theGod Wars Dungeonand in theDesert Bandit Camp.

Development history[edit|edit source]

In response to player requests for a magic weapon with the same functionality as the 2010 version of thestaff of lightfromRuneScape, the weapon was offered as a new reward fromK'ril Tsutsarothin aDeveloper's Blogoffering theGod Wars Dungeon. The weapon passed thepollwith 78% of the supporting votes.

Though the weapon had passed the poll, it had not been given a name or design yet. AnotherDeveloper's Blogwas released two weeks after the poll ended, giving players insight on the technical limitations that the team had in terms of graphics, such as being unable to take models fromRuneScapeto use for a staff of light model, and only being able to use six colours for item models. With the limitations in mind, the team then offered six designs for the weapon:

Staff of light: A recolouredRod of Ivandis.Staff of darkness: A recoloured Rod of Ivandis in the colours ofZamorak.Staff of wrath: Uses theanger spearfrom the questA Soul's Baneas the design.Staff of the dead: Uses the staffNecrovaruswields as the design.Staff of the damned: A recolouredAhrim's staffin the colours ofZamorak.Wand of darkness: Uses theinfused wandfrom the questWhat Lies Belowas the design.

The designs were thenpolled; the design with the most votes was Necrovarus' staff of the dead (25.6%). The other designs, in order of popularity, were:

Staff of Darkness (22.5%)Staff of Light (19.7%)Staff of Wrath (13.2%)Wand of Darkness (9.9%)Staff of the Damned (9.1%)

Changes[edit|edit source]

Date | Changes

23 May2024(update) | The staff's special attack effect is now cleared when using arejuvenation pool.

8 January2015(update) | Toxic Staff of the Dead, a lvl 75 Attack/Magic Bladed Staff has been added to the game by adding a Magic Fang onto it.

21 November2013(update) | The Staff of the Dead's special attack code was occasionally reading a bit of memory that hadn't been initialised; this could potentially have caused the special attack to malfunction. This is now fixed.

7 November2013(update|poll) | Thespecial attack- blocking some of the melee damage you take - is now counted as aMagicattack. When participating inClan Warsor legacy duels within theEmir's Arena, if the combat rules would forbidMagic, the player will equally be unable to use thisspecial attack.Can now be used to auto-castFlames of Zamorak

Trivia[edit|edit source]

It is based on the staff wielded byNecrovarus.The staff of the dead is one of four unique boss drops that are not dropped by the respective bodyguards (excluding hilts), the others beingsteam battlestaff,Saradomin's light, andArmadyl crossbow.
