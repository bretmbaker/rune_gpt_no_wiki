High Level Alchemy(also known ashigh alch,hi alch,orHA) is autility spellavailable in thestandard spellbook. It requires level 55Magicto cast, and grants 65 Magicexperienceper cast.

When cast on an item in the player's inventory, the item is converted into a number ofcoinsequivalent to 60% of the item'svalue(not the item'sGrand Exchangeprice). This is a 50% higher yield thanLow Level Alchemy.

Casting High Level Alchemy (commonly known as "alching") is a popular way for players to trainMagic, either by itself or in tandem with other skills (such asAgility). Players who train this way can break even on the cost of runes, or even turn a profit, by buying items on the Grand Exchange for a lower cost than the item's High Alchemy value (see below).

Cost[edit|edit source]

TheExplorer's ring 4can be used to cast High Level Alchemy up to 30 times per day without requiring any runes. Players will not gain any experience when casting High Level Alchemy this way.

Standing near theFountain of Runein theWildernessallows players to cast High Level Alchemy without requiring any runes. Players will not gain any experience when casting High Level Alchemy this way. This method can be used to turn a greater profit when alching by removing the cost of runes, but comes with significant risk, as the Fountain of Rune is a hotspot forplayer killers.

Usage[edit|edit source]

Casting High Alchemy is done by first clicking the icon in thespell bookand then clicking the item to cast it on in the inventory. The inventory screen will pop up automatically after clicking the spell icon.

High (and Low) Alchemy can be cast on noted items, saving much withdrawal time from the bank, and simplifying the "click pattern", i.e. the player can place the stack of notes in the same position in their inventory that the alchemy spell is in the spellbook, so that they do not have to move their mouse much to repeatedly cast the spell. Casting alchemy spells on stackable items will only alchemise one at a time. As High Level Alchemy can recast every 5 ticks (3.0 seconds), it is possible to alch around 1,200 items per hour (one item every three seconds) for a total of 78,000 Magic experience.

By usingAuto Retaliate, a player can use the spell after their attack (typically by checking for an XP drop), but before getting hit, to alch while training combat skills. If done correctly, the player can maintain combat by re-aggroing from the hit landing after the spell is cast. This can be inefficient against NPCs with slow attack speeds, while being difficult to time correctly against NPCs with high attack speeds.

If the player attempts to cast an alchemy spell on a valuable item, the player will receive a warning message as explained below.

Warning system[edit|edit source]

High Alchemy 'Valuable Drop Warning' is set to automatically prompt when trying to cast it on an untradeable item or on an item worth 1,000 coins or more. This helps to prevent casting it accidentally on items that are hard to obtain. The threshold value for which the warning is displayed can be altered, and the warning for untradeable items can be disabled, byright clicking (PC) or pressing and holding (Mobile) on the icon in the spell book. A drop-down menu will appear, giving the options to "Cast High Level Alchemy" or "Warnings High Level Alchemy." Clicking on "Warnings High Level Alchemy will give the options to 'Set Value Threshold," or "Disable Untradeable Item Warning."

"Set Value Threshold"changes the value at which a warning appears on screen. Setting this to a very high value will ensure the warning is never triggered.

"Disable Untradeable Item"disables warning when attempting to cast High Level Alchemy on untradeable items with a value lower than the threshold.

It should be noted that the valuable item warning depends upon the item'sGrand Exchange value, not its High Alchemy value, even if the alchemy value is higher. This is useful to avoid accidentally alchemising very expensive items with a relatively low high alchemy value, such asRanger boots, which have a Grand Exchange value of35,138,101coins compared to their High Alchemy value of 120 coins. As long as the warning threshold value is set below its Grand Exchange value, accidental alching of the item should not happen if the player is paying attention.

High Alchemy profit/loss on some items[edit|edit source]

Generally, using High Alchemy will not produce as much GP per hour as other,much better methods, however because it can be done so easily at a profit while levellingMagicit is still used. While Grand Exchange buy limits may present a limiting factor, with a large enough starting amount of GP, a player with 55 Magic can net several hundred thousand GP every few hours buying and alchemizing a combination of the following items in the table below while standing around the Grand Exchange. High Level Alchemy can also be done while training other skills such asAgility, allowing players to train Magic at the same time. Here is a list of commonly crafted items players may wish to alchemise and their calculated possible profit/loss. Prices assume a source of unlimited fire runes is used, such as aStaff of fire.

Crafting/Smithing/Fletching + High Alchemy[edit|edit source]

This is typicallyNOTthe best way to profit from High Alchemy unless the player creates the items themselves. However, casting High Alchemy on platebodies typically results in less financial loss as opposed to simply buying the materials, smithing the armour, and selling the finished armour back. As such, this is primarily done by players who wish to trainMagicalong with other skills such asCraftingorSmithingorFletchingthrough buying materials directly from theGrand Exchange. The table below does not include the price of the mould for items which require one to craft, as molds are not consumed. The materials cost includes the price of High Alchemy assuming use of fire staff + nature rune.

Special cases[edit|edit source]

Somespecialty shopsmay offer a higher price for certain items than the amount High Level Alchemy gives. For example, High Level Alchemy converts agold necklaceinto 270 coins, butGrum's Gold ExchangeinPort Sarimoffers 315 if there are no gold necklace in the shop's stock. The price decreases 9 coins for each additional necklace in the shop inventory until it reaches a low limit of 45 coins when there are 30 or more necklaces. Some players sell up to about 11 items and thenworld switchto find another shop which has a low inventory.

There are also somegeneral storeswhich buy initially for item's 60% value:

Bandit Duty Freeshop in theBandit Camp, midWilderness.Martin Thwait's Lost and Found.in theRogues' Den, level 50ThievingandAgilityrequired.Karamja General Storebuys at 40% item value, or 60% when a pair ofKaramja gloves 3or above are equipped.

The following stores buy for 55%:

Trivia[edit|edit source]

An attempt was made to implement amagic tabletfor the High Level Alchemy spell in the lead-up to theConstructionupdate, which ultimately proved unsuccessful due to limitations in the way item interactions were handled.[1]Players would have been required to use a High Alchemy tablet on another item in order to alchemise it, which would run into problems when that item already had use-item-on-item code defined. For example, if one were to have used a High Alchemy tablet on arune spear, the weapon would execute the item interaction code associated with usingweapon poisonon it instead, frustrating the attempt to run the alchemisation code defined on the magic tablet.According to an issue of thePostbag from the Hedge, a portion of the alchemised gold is "waylaid" bySanta Clauswhenever someone uses High Level Alchemy on an item, as a means to fundChristmaspresent production.[2]Presumably, the percentage of gold siphoned off to Lapland is equal to 40% of an item's value, that is to say the share not received by the player.
