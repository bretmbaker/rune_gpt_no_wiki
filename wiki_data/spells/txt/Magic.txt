Magicis one of the most importantskillsinOld School RuneScapeand is one of the threecombat classes. It is used incombatviacombat spells, fast transport around the world viateleportation spells, and allowscrafteditemsto be enchanted and convert items intocoinsthroughutility spells. While it is possible to play the game without being skilled in Magic, it is a considerable advantage to be able to use manyspells, especially High Level Alchemy and teleports.

Magic is also important in order to defend well against Magic attacks. UnlikeMeleeandRanged defence, a player'sMagic defenceis actually determined by both Magic (70%) andDefence(30%) levels, as well as Magic defence bonus.

Spells[edit|edit source]

Magic is used almost exclusively through casting spells onmonsters, another player, on one's self (reflexively), or on anitem.

Magic spells are divided into three distinct types: Combat, Teleport, and Utility spells.

Combat spells[edit|edit source]

Combat spells are primarily used by players, mostly in battle, for their offensive capabilities. Combat spells can be separated into three sub-types:

Offensive spells - Used to deal magical damage against opponents.Curse spells - Used to disable or debilitate an opponent.Support spells - Offers a range of benefits to the caster or recipient.

Teleport spells[edit|edit source]

Teleport spells instantly transport players to a predetermined location. Asteleportationsave lots of time when travelling around the world, they are widely used among all players.

Some spells may teleport players to the dangerousWilderness, where they are warned before the spell is actually cast, though this can be toggled by right-clicking the spell icon.

Utility spells[edit|edit source]

Utility spells are primarily used by players outside of combat inskillingactivities, such as enchanting jewellery, bakingpies, or reanimatingensouled heads.

TheLunar spellbook, accessible bymembers, focuses heavily on utility spells.

Spellbooks[edit|edit source]

There are four different spellbooks used to cast magic spells from. A player may only cast spells from their current spellbook, and if they wish to use spells from another spellbook, they must change to that spellbook through various means.

To cast aspell, a player must choose the desired spell from their spellbook. To access the activated spellbook, click on the spellbook icon in the game'sinterface.

Free-to-playplayers only have access to thestandard spellbook, while the other three spellbooks are only available formembersafter unlocking them through various content.

As with otherskills, some spells require higher skill levels to cast.

Standard spellbook[edit|edit source]

The standard spellbook is available to all players. There is no prerequisite to using the standard spellbook, although some spells are only available on members' worlds and others require completion of certainquestsor tasks.

Arceuus spellbook[edit|edit source]

The Arceuus spellbook is available to all players by talking toTyssat theDark Altarin northernArceuus. Like thestandard spellbook, it has a variety of teleport and utility spells at its disposal, with a focus on necromancy. A larger set of combat and utility spells are only accessible to players who have completed the questA Kingdom Divided.

Ancient Magicks[edit|edit source]

Ancient Magicks are available to players upon completion of the questDesert Treasure I. Unlike the other spellbooks, the Ancient Magicks is significantly combat-oriented, including some of the most powerful combat spells in the game.

Lunar spellbook[edit|edit source]

The Lunar spellbook is available to players upon completion of the questLunar Diplomacy. The spellbook is primarily oriented towards utility spells and combat-support spells, although some of them are only accessible to players who have completed the questDream Mentorand completion of theHard Fremennik Diary.

Equipment[edit|edit source]

Runes[edit|edit source]

All spells (with the exception of theHome Teleports) require the use ofrunesas a consumed resource. Runes are stackable, commonly traded items which are obtained by various methods, such as by crafting them via theRunecraftskill or obtained as drops from monsters.

The requirement for certainrunesin a spell can be removed if the player wields anelemental staffor chargedtomecorresponding to an elemental rune. As an example, wielding astaff of fireor chargedtome of fireallows a player to castHigh Level Alchemyusing only onenature rune.

Magic weapons[edit|edit source]

Magic weapons attack from a distance and come in two primary types, weapons that canautocastspells andpowered staves. Magic weapons that can autocast spells includestaves,wandsandbladed staves. They can be used as melee weapons, however their primary function is for casting spells, taking place ofelementalrunes,auto cast, and access to specific spells likeMagic Dart. Powered staves instead have a built-in magic spell that can be used regardless of the spellbook the player is using. Most magic weapons also boost Magic attack andMagic defence.

In the list below are all thefree-to-playstaves, which all can be obtained atZaff's store inVarrock.

Magic armour and robes[edit|edit source]

Most mages wearrobes, although some light armour is available that is made from special material and does not hinder the wearer's ability to perform magical attacks. For the different sets of armour and detailed information on each piece, see thearmour guide.

A player can have a Magic attack bonus ofup to 172, and a Magic defence bonusup to 253. The lowest Magic attack bonus is -105, which will help preventspellsfrom hitting an opponent while training (i.e.splashing).

Combat[edit|edit source]

Monster Magic defence[edit|edit source]

A monster's defence level has no effect on the accuracy of incoming magical attacks. Instead, a monster's magical defence roll is calculated solely from their magic level and Magic defence bonus. This differs from range and melee, as they use the defence level and respective defence bonus.[1]

Magic accuracy[edit|edit source]

There is no difference in magic accuracy between spells; higher-leveled spells are as equally accurate as lower-leveled spells. An exception to this is the accuracy bonus provided byDemonbanespells.Magic accuracy is solely determined by the attacker's Attack roll and the defender's Defence roll.The Attack roll and Defence roll formulas are different for monsters and players; their Attack and Defence effective levels differ.The player's accuracy rolldepends on the player's Magic level (Mlvl) and Magic equipment attack bonus (Meab).[2]Because visible Magic level is used, offensive Prayer effects need to be considered (Pe).Monster's accuracy rolldepends on the monster's Magic level (Mlvl) and Magic attack bonuses (Mab).The player's defence rolldepends on the player's Magic level (Mlvl), player's Defence lvl (Dlvl), Magic equipment defence bonus (Medb) and defensive Prayer effects (Pe).Monster's defence rolldepends on the monster's Magic level (Mlvl), monster's Magic defence bonus (Mdb)

 |  | Player | Monster

Attacking | Effective level (Ea) | Mlvl×Pe+8 | Mlvl+9

Attack Roll (Ra) | Ea×(Meab+64) | Ea×(Mab+64)

Defending | Effective level (Ed) | Mlvl×0.7+Dlvl×0.3+8 | Mlvl+9

Defence Roll (Rd) | Ed×(Medb+64) | Ed×(Mdb+64)

The hit chancecan be calculated by taking Attack roll (Ra) of the attacker (Player/Monster) and comparing it with Defence roll (Rd) of the defender. Both can be calculated from given table.IfRa>Rdthen Hit chanceHc=1−((Rd+2)/(2×(Ra+1))Otherwise Hit chanceHc=Ra/(2×(Rd+1))[1][3]Examples of Defence roll calculation for monstersCallisto(Membersonly)Effective levelEd=Mlvl+9=140+9=149Defence rollRd=Ed×(Mdb+64)=149×(0+64)=9536Skeletal wyvern(Membersonly)Effective levelEd=Mlvl+9=125+9=134Defence roll:Rd=Ed×(Mdb+64)=134×(80+64)=19,296Protect from Magicmakes most NPCs splash against players.[4]

Elemental weaknesses[edit|edit source]

Additionally, certain monsters are weak to a certain type of elemental spell from thestandard spellbook. For every point of elemental weakness a monster has, the player gains a +1% accuracy and damage bonus for that elemental type.

Activities and locations[edit|edit source]

There are several activities and locations in the game that are directly related to the Magic skill.

There are stores that sell runes and staves as well asMystic robes.TheMage Training Arena, on the northernmost edge of theKharidian Desert.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

In early 2001, there were two magic skills, Good Magic and Evil Magic. However, with the introduction of a new magic system, the lower skill was removed, and the higher skill changed to Magic. For example, if the player had level 50 Good Magic and level 40 Evil Magic, they would keep level 50 Magic, and the experience for the Evil Magic was discarded. Because of this, some players were upset that they lost money for training their lower magic skill, and that the experience was thrown away instead of carried over. There were also spells like Shock Bolt, Elemental Bolt, Camouflage, and Fear.Prior to the introduction ofRuneScape 2,combat spellswere universally represented by a simple, flying blue star, which proved difficult to distinguish fromarrows, which were green stars. Also, inRuneScape Classic, players were capable of casting magic spells while wearing fullrune armour, leading to a massive imbalance in favour of high-level mages.Prior to the advent ofmulticombat areasinRuneScape 2, mages andarcherscould attack enemies while ameleefighter engaged themonsterin directcombat. This was the most common way for multiple players to attack the same creature, usually high level bosses like theKing Black Dragon. The loot would go to whoever dealt the most damage, and the person who dealt the last hit would be the only one to receiveexperience, though less than if they had killed the monster themselves.InRuneScape Classic, each spell gave the fixed experience using the formula 2 * spell level + 20. Magic was a much faster skill to train if you could get sufficientrunes, though runes were much harder to obtain. WithRuneScape 2came the introduction ofRunecraftand many monsters with much higher rune drop rates, so runes became much easier to obtain. Accordingly, experience rates were also reduced to where they are today. Now normal spells generally gives (spell level + 10) experience and combat spells generally give a base experience of (spell level + 10)/2.ARuneScape Mythbustersepisode aired on Twitch revealed that a player's Magic level plays a role in defending against Magic attacks.
