Trivia[edit|edit source]

Snarebehaviour was modified without a patch note in an update. UnlikeBindand similarly toice spellslikeIce Barrage, this spell could have been cast on a target that was immune to its binding effect (likely due to the minor damage that it can inflict). Currently, attempting to cast the spell on an immobilized target results in the messageYour target is already held by a magical force., while trying to cast the spell on a target during the grace period after the end of the binding effect results in the messageThe target is currently immune to that spell.
