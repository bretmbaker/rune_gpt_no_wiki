Theancient staffis a one-handed magical weapon that can be used to autocast spells from theAncient spellbookandstandard spellbook. It requires 50 Attack and 50 Magic to wield, along with completion ofDesert Treasure I. The staff is decorated with the symbol ofZaros.

It is frequently used in high-level player-killing due to its high magical accuracy. It, along with its upgraded versions, are the only items that have negative Prayer bonus.

Similarly tobladed staves, this staff has anattack speedof 4, making it a suitable weapon for melee combat, displaying similar stats as those of therune scimitarwith slightly higher strength bonus and lower attack bonus. It is outclassed in melee combat by thegranite hammer, which also requires 50Attackto wield, with an additional requirement of 50Strength.

The staff may be boughtoncefromEblisfor80,000 coinsafter completing Desert Treasure I. For this reason,Ironmenare not recommended to alch or drop it because it is used in amaster clue step.

The ancient staff can be upgraded to theancient sceptreby bringing an ancient staff and anancient iconto Eblis. This process isirreversibleand the sceptre is untradeable.
