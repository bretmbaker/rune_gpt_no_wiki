Thepurging staffis a one-handed magicdemonbane weaponrequiring level 77Magicand 50Attackto wield. It is made by using atormented synapseon an anvil with abattlestaff,iron bar, and ahammerin the inventory. This requires level 74Crafting(boostable), level 55Smithing(not boostable), and having readDuradel's notesafter completion ofWhile Guthix Sleeps.

Able toautocastoffensiveArceuus spells, castingdemonbane spellswith the staff will double their bonuses; this also doubles the bonuses gained whilst theMark of Darknessspell is active. Additionally, the duration of Mark of Darkness lasts 5 times longer if the staff is equipped when cast. Unequipping the staff will not reduce the duration of Mark of Darkness or remove the mark. The purging staff can also autocast elemental combat spells from thestandard spellbook.

Its +37 magic attack and +25 magic defence bonuses are the highest of any weapon in the game, surpassing even theKodai wandandTumeken's shadow. The staff also increases magic damage dealt by 10%, which combined with the staff's other effects make it a formidable weapon in select encounters.

The process to create the purging staff can be reversed, returning only the tormented synapse as a result. Aplayer killerwill receive the synapse from their opponent if it is not one of their protected items.
