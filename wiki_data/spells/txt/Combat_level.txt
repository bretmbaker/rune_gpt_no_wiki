Normally,aggressivenon-player characters stop attacking you when you reach higher than double their combat level. There are exceptions, however - for example, almost any monsters, except forRats, in theWildernesswill be aggressive no matter what your combat level is.

By default, monsters with a higher combat level than a player cannot be attacked by using a left mouse click, requiring a right click to select theattack monsteroption. So, to be able to attack aBlue dragonwith combat level 111 with a simple left click, a player would need a combat level of at least 111. However, this behaviour can be changed in the controls section of theSettingstab by changing the "NPC 'Attack' Options" setting.

All new players start out at combat level 3, and the maximum level for players inOld School RuneScapeis level 126. Players will receive a combat level-up notification upon reaching a new combat level. This can be disabled in thegame settings.

Slayer masters, by default, have a combat level requirement to get certain Slayer tasks from them. Players can get more difficult tasks by asking the Slayer master to ignore combat level, though this does not bypass the minimum combat requirement to get a task from that master.

Calculating combat level[edit|edit source]

Simply[edit|edit source]

Take yourPrayerlevel and divide it by two and round down (for example, if your Prayer level is 43, dividing by two and rounding down gives you 21)Add this to yourHitpointsandDefencelevels and divide the result by 4. This is your base combat level. (For example, if your Hitpoints is 60, Defence is 70 and prayer is 43 you should end up with 37.75)Add yourStrengthandAttacklevels together and multiply by 0.325. Add this to your base combat level and you should have your melee combat level.If yourMagicorRangedlevel is exceptionally higher than your Attack and Strength, carry on - in the calculation noted below Magic is used, but if your Ranged is exceptionally higher, use that instead in all casesDivide your Magic level by 2 and round down, and then add your Magic level again to this (for example, if your Magic level is 83, you should end up with 124)Multiply this by 0.325 and add the result to your base combat level calculated above, and you should have your magic combat level.

Mathematics[edit|edit source]

Base=14×(Defence+Hitpoints+⌊Prayer×12⌋)Melee=1340×(Attack+Strength)Range=1340×⌊Ranged×32⌋Mage=1340×⌊Magic×32⌋Final=⌊Base+max(Melee,Range,Mage)⌋

Melee Combat Level=⌊Base + Melee⌋=⌊14×(Defence+Hitpoints+⌊Prayer×12⌋)+1340×(Attack+Strength)⌋Ranged Combat Level=⌊Base + Range⌋=⌊14×(Defence+Hitpoints+⌊Prayer×12⌋)+1340×⌊Ranged×32⌋⌋Magic Combat Level=⌊Base + Mage⌋=⌊14×(Defence+Hitpoints+⌊Prayer×12⌋)+1340×⌊Magic×32⌋⌋
