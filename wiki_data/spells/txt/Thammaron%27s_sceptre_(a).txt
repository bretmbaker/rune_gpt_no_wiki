Passive effect[edit|edit source]

When Thammaron's sceptre (a) is charged withrevenant ether, an additional 50% magic accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking anyNPCin theWilderness, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not. It is applied to anycombat spellscast when it is equipped.

This effect will stack with aSlayer helmet (i)or aSalve amulet(i)and their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes the sceptre the second best magic weapon in the Wilderness after theaccursed sceptre, surpassing the damage output of atrident of the seasorswampwith the additional capability of attacking any hostile players, something which both tridents are incapable of doing.

Charging and death[edit|edit source]

To use the sceptre's passive effect, it must first be activated with 1,000revenant ether(costing171,000 coins). The 1,000 ether used to activate the sceptredoes notcount towards the usage of the passive effect, thus additional ether must be added (up to 16,000) to increase the sceptre's damage output. Players can configure the charges while the sceptre is in their bank by right-clicking on Configure-Charges, as long as players have the required materials. The hourly cost of constantly using this weapon to cast spells is 1,200 ether or205,200 coins, as spells can only be cast every 5game ticks.

The ether can be safely removed by selecting the right-clickUnchargeoption on the sceptre, after which the sceptre becomes tradeable again.

Upondeathwithin the Wilderness, any revenant ether stored within the sceptre willalwaysbe dropped, even if it is one of the player's protected items. Because of this, despite the sceptre being able to store a maximum of 17,000 revenant ether, it is recommended to store the minimum amount required for a trip into the Wilderness (in addition to the 1,000 ether required to activate the weapon).
