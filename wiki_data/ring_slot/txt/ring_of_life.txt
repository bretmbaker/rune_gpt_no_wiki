[Weapon: Ring Of Life]


Thering of lifeis adiamond ringthat has been enchanted withLvl-4 Enchant. While worn, if the wearer is attacked and has 10% or less of theirHitpointsremaining, the ring automaticallyteleportsthe wearer to theirrespawn point. The ring crumbles to dust after one use. ADefence capecan be worn for the same effect, which does not destroy itself on activation. AnEscape crystalcan be configured to provide the same effect and more.
The ring does not guarantee total safety, as a player wearing one will still die if they are hit from above 10% of their maximum Hitpoints to zero (for example, being hit 15 while at 15 hitpoints), and itwill notcurepoison. Self-inflicted damage, such as guzzling adwarven rock cakeor using alocator orb, can also activate the effect. If it is worn along with aphoenix necklace, the necklace effect will trigger first. InPvP, theTele Blockspell will prevent a player's ring of life from activating. The teleport will work up to level 30Wilderness, as opposed to the normal limit of level 20 for most jewellery-based teleports belowdragonstone.
