[Weapon: Ring Of The Elements#Charged]


Thering of the elementsis an item purchased from theGuardians of the Riftrewardshopfor 400abyssal pearls. It teleports players near theelemental runic altars.
The ring is charged by using one of eachelemental rune(Air,Earth,Fire,Water) and onelaw runetogether on the ring (costing152per teleport), up to a maximum of 10,000 charges (costing1,520,000to fully charge). Players can receive the runes back through the ring's right-click "Uncharge" option while at a bank. Regardless of charge, the item counts as a piece ofwarm clothingatWintertodt, and is the only ring slot item to do so. The number of charges left is tracked for each player, not each ring; thus, a second ring will have the same number of charges remaining as any other ring the player owns. When charged, the ring is untradeable.
