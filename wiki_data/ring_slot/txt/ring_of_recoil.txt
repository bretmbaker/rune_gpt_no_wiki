[Weapon: Ring Of Recoil]


Aring of recoilis created by usingLvl-1 Enchanton asapphire ring. When worn, 10% + 1 of the damage received by the player (rounded down) is dealt to the attacker - the attacking entity must cause damage before the recoil effect takes place. This effect applies to both players andNPCs. The ring of recoil is capable of dealing up to 40hitpointsof damage before shattering.
To see the remaining damage the ring can deal, the player can check it, while equipped, in theWorn Equipmentinterface. The amount of damage left is kept track of for each player, not each ring; thus, a newly-equipped ring will have the same number of charges remaining as any other ring the player wears. If the player wishes to obtain a ring with 40 charges remaining, the player must use any ring of recoil completely until it shatters, or use the right-click "Break" option on a ring while in theinventory.
