[Passive Effect]
The elven signet offers a 10% chance to not use a charge when usingcrystal equipment, excluding theblade of Saeldorand thebow of Faerdhinen. Since a charge can be saved, then saved again at a 10% chance, the number of effective chargesS(x)given a crystal item withxcharges is given byS(x)=x∑n=0∞10−n=1.11¯x. So an additional 1/9th charges are expected using the elven signet.
