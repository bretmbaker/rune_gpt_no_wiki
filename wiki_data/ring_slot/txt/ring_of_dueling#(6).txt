[Weapon: Ring Of Dueling#(6)]


Thering of duelingis a teleportation ring that may be made by castingLvl-2 Enchanton anemerald ring, granting 37Magicexperience. A full ring of dueling will provide 8 teleports before it crumbles away into nothing. Due to the low cost of the ring, many players use it to bank quickly at theCastle Warschest. Furthermore, theFerox Enclaveteleport allows a player to use thePool of Refreshmentwhilst gaining full health, prayer and run energy, although the Ferox Enclave teleport places the player slightly farther away from a bank chest.
Each charge costs88.13coinsif all 8 charges are used,7.86if using High Level Alchemy (as described below), or44.29if usingLow Level Alchemy. Alternatively,Explorer's ringcan be used 30 times per day for a cost of27.86. This is viable if fewer than 210 charges are used on average each day, though it gives no Magic experience.
