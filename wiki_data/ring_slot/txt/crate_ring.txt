[Weapon: Crate Ring]


Thecrate ringis an item that can be obtained from participating in anyEaster event, and was first obtained from the2022 Easter event. When equipped, the player's model transforms into a crate. While this effect is active, the player cannot move, or the player's model will return to normal.
While in crate form, if another player right clicks on the player disguised as a crate, the normal options will appear (i.e. "Walk here Username", "Follow Username", etc.) Upon equipping the ring, the player will receive the messageYou hide inside the crate. Sneaky!
