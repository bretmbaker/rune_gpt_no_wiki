[Weapon: Ring Of Visibility]


Thering of visibilityis a special ring that can be obtained fromRasolothe merchant, after the player retrieves hisgilded crossfor him during the questDesert Treasure I. Wearing the ring lets the player seemysterious ghostsand other objects that are normally invisible. The ring of visibility cannot be made using theCraftingskill. It cannot be equipped in theLassar Undercity.
If the player dies with the ring equipped or in their inventory, they will always lose it even if they had less than 3 items (or four withProtect Item). The two exceptions are if the player dies while fightingDamisduring Desert Treasure I, in which case they will keep the ring like normal, or if the player dies in the Shadow Realm during Desert Treasure II, in which case it will be kept or appear in your gravestone loot. If lost, the ring can be reclaimed fromRasolo, west of theFishing Guildand south of theBaxtorian Falls. It may be possible for the ring to not remain in the player's inventory upon death, in this event the player can only retrieve their items fromDeath's Officeas they will not be able to use the ghostly ladder without the ring.
