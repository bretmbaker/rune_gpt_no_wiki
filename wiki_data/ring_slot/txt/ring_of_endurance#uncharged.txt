[Weapon: Ring Of Endurance#Uncharged]


Thering of enduranceis a potential reward from theGrand Hallowed Coffinon the final floor of theHallowed Sepulchreand requires level 70 in theAgilityskill to equip. Theringcan be charged withstamina potionsandstamina mixes, with each dose granting one charge. Storing a maximum of 1,000 charges, it costs1,627,250to fully charge. The ring counts as aSaradominitem within theHallowed Sepulchreand theGod Wars Dungeon.
The ring provides two effects when charged. First, if the player consumes a dose of a stamina potion or mix with the ring equipped, one charge is consumed, 40% of the player's run energy is restored, and the stamina potion effect is activated for four minutes (compared to 20% run energy restoration and two minute effect duration when not wearing the ring). This effect is immediately halved if the ring is unequipped. Second, if the ring has 500 charges or more, it will passively reduce therun energydrain rate by 15% without using any charges. The passive effect does not stack with the stamina potion effect.
