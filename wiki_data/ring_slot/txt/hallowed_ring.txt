[Weapon: Hallowed Ring]


Hallowed ringis a reward from theHallowed Sepulchre. It can be purchased from theMysterious Hallowed Goodsshop for 250hallowed marks. When equipped, it negates all damage taken from failing environmental obstacles like theknight statues' swords and thecrossbowman statues' bolts, and reduces the recovery time by teleporting the player back to the start of the obstacle should they fail. It has no effect on the recovery time for failing the grapplepillarsand does not negate damage taken for failing to enchantportal frames.
The ring also counts as a Saradomin item for the purposes of recharging your runenergyat the Magical Obelisks at the end of each floor and as a follower item inGod Wars Dungeon.
