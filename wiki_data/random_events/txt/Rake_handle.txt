[Page: Rake handle]

Arake handleforms part of arake, along with therake head. A rake handle can potentially be obtained duringMy Arm's Big Adventure; the player must then fix the rake and hand it back toMy Arm.
There used to be a random event in which a rake would break into these two parts. The only use for this item is to combine it with the rake head (which will be strewn randomly around the surrounding area) to form a whole rake again.
The item was added to the game cache.
