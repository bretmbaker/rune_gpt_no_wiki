[Page: Watchman (random event)]

Thewatchmanwas arandom eventthat appeared duringThieving, similar to other guardian events such as therock golem. His level differed depending on the player's combat level. The Watchman would say "(Player's Name), you are under arrest!" before attacking. He was removed in a hidden update in August 2006 due to players' complaints about being killed too quickly when pickpocketing at a low hitpoint level and wearing no armour. As a result, he has never been present inOld School RuneScape.

Eventually, references to him were removed from the Knowledge Base between2 Novemberand5 November2006.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

There was a bug in free worlds where if the player tried to steal from a stall (such as thetea stall) in south-east Varrock, a watchman would appear. He would attack and the player could fight him. He would not drop any member items on free to play worlds.In the Draynor Bank's security recording of theDraynor Bank Robbery, a Watchman appeared but was killed quickly by the Wise Old Man. When the watchman was discontinued, the watchman in the video footage was replaced by thePillory Guard, even though the bank robbery was an event that had supposedly happened before the Pillory Guard existed.
