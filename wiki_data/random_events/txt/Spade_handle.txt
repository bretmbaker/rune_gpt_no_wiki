[Page: Spade handle]

Aspade handlewas previously obtained as part of arandom event. It formed part of aspade, along with thespade head. A spade would randomly break into these two parts.
The only use for this item was to combine it with the spade head (which was strewn randomly around the surrounding area) to form a whole spade again.
In 2014, the random event was discontinued and all spade handles were automatically repaired.
The item was made usable by free-to-play players.
The item was added to the game cache.
