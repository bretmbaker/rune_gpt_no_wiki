[Page: Random events]

Random events,anti-macro events,or simplyrandomsrefers to a variety ofNPCsand their associated areas that appear throughoutRuneScapeto interact withplayers. They will appear either to provide an item to a player or to ask the player to play a shortminigameto earn a prize. When random events appear, they specify one player with whom they will interact, and only that player will be able to interact with them, besides basic dismissive dialogue. If the player does not wish to interact with the random event, they can right-click and dismiss the event, or just ignore the event which disappears after a minute.

Not all random events are allowed everywhere in the game. For example, any random event that takes players into a separate instance will never appear in theWilderness(as it could allow a fleeing player to escape and remain there until it is safe). Random events will also not appear in most banks, boss areas, and minigames; if a random event NPC is following the player into a disallowed area, it will despawn and not return, except forCount Check,Dr Jekyll, and theGenie.

History[edit|edit source]

Random events were originally implemented as an anti-macrotechnology alongsideRuneScape 2, which eliminatedRuneScape Classic's fatigue system. With the fatigue system, players were required to sleep in a bed or a sleeping bag for a few seconds after gaining a certain amount ofexperience. In order to wake up from sleeping, the player would need to answer acaptchato resume playing. Players could continue to train skills or combat if their fatigue was at 100%, but they would not gain any more experience until they slept.

Random events were designed to simultaneously preventmacrosfrom operating properly and to reward legitimate players with small rewards. Some random events, such as theRock golem,Tree spirit, orEvil Chicken, would attack and eventually kill players that did not run away from them. Events like theExploding rockwould damage players' equipment if they did not stop mining that rock until the smoke went away. This would require players to repair theirequipmentfor a small fee before they could resume using it. Some events, such as theGenie, provided a small reward to players for simply talking to them, and would teleport players away from their current location if they were ignored.

These events were eventually phased out inRuneScape 3as better anti-macro software was developed. After the release ofOld School RuneScape, players and developers realized that modern macro clients were able to solve random events relatively easily and that a more comprehensive anti-macrosolution needed to be implemented in the rebooted game. Many players complained that random events were harming gameplay; for example, players fightingaggressivemonsters in theAbyssorApe Atoll Dungeonwould likely be confronted by a random event such as theSandwich lady, who would teleport players away if they could not solve her puzzle. Players would be unable to solve the puzzle interface because they were surrounded by aggressive monsters and would end up being teleported away, even though they were playing entirely within the rules.

The developers were able to implementRuneScape 3's anti-macro software intoOld School RuneScape, after which they polled for the removal of aggressive random events and the conversion of other mandatory events to be optional based on a Developer Blog on 28 August 2014.[1]The poll was met with a positive 86.6% of the vote, and the changes were implemented shortly thereafter. Thisupdateallowed players to decide whether or not to partake in these events, without a risk of dying. It also removed several random events from the game.

List of random events[edit|edit source]

Traditionally, most random events would be assigned to askillor a specific task - for example, theBeekeeperrandom event would only appear to players who were pickingflax, and theGravediggerwould only appear while buryingbones. Since theOptional Randoms update, all events can happen at any time in any place, with the exception of certain excluded areas.

The following random events can appear inOld School RuneScape:

Spawn mechanics[edit|edit source]

To determine when the player will receive a random event, the game will pick a point in time between 1 and 2 hours in advance when the player is next due to receive an event spawn.[7]This moment is defined in relation to a real-time clock, meaning it will tick down even if the player is not logged in.[8]A check is made every 5 minutes of in-game time to see if the required duration has elapsed.[9]If the player is available when that time rolls around, an event will be selected at random from all of those the player is eligible to receive (depending on their location), with each one of them having equal weighting.[10]In case the player is offline when they are due to receive one however, the timer will be extended by 10 to 70 minutes and continue counting down.[11]

Supposing the player is in alocation where random events are not allowed to spawnwhen they become eligible to receive one, it is likely that they will miss out on the opportunity altogether, leading to a new spawn moment being chosen one to two hours down the line.[12]Random events will not spawn if the player character is using an altered model, for instance while atransformation ringorgreegreeis equipped.[13]In the rare case a player would be eligible to receive an event while a previously spawned random event NPC is still trying to draw their attention, a second event NPC will not be spawned.[14]

Certain random events may also be prevented from spawning if the player is engaged in combat.[15]

It is possible to briefly stall an event spawn if the player has an interface open or is in the middle of a repeated skilling action (through the "Make-X" option) when they are awarded an event, in which case its spawn will be delayed until the player becomes available again.[16][17]In the event a player is teleported away from a tile that has afterwards become inaccessible, they will be teleported back to Lumbridge upon completing the event instead.[18]Standing on a tile previously occupied by an object of destructible scenery can cause this to happen in case it respawns while the player is away.[19]

Strategy[edit|edit source]

While most random events offer relatively small rewards for the effort required to complete them, like theCapt' Arnav's Chest, some rewards can be very fortunate.

Valuable random events[edit|edit source]

It is recommended to always do the following random events:

Maze: The maze takes less than two minutes to complete at the fastest speed, with rewards possibly including hundreds ofchaosanddeath runes.Quiz Master: Choose theMystery boxfor the highest possible reward, with a chance forclue scrolls(up to hard) or astale baguetteworth1,425,556on theGrand Exchange.Sandwich lady: She gives a small chance of giving astale baguetteinstead of a regular baguette worth1,425,556on theGrand ExchangeGenie: Gives alamp(up to 990experience) for simply talking to him.Count Check: Gives alamp(up to 990experience) for simply talking to him, if the player has both aJagex Accountand aBank PIN.Beekeeper: Gives alamp(up to 990experience) and either a part of thebeekeeper's outfitor coins.Surprise Exam: Although it takes about a minute to complete, thebook of knowledge(up to 1,485experience) can be valuable forpuresand new players wishing to level a skill fast.TheDrill Demon,Freaky Forester,GravediggerandMimeevents reward you with alampafter their respective outfit (and emotes, in the case of the Mime) has been obtained. Also theKiss the Frogevent rewards afrog tokenwhich can always be traded in for a lamp, or for pieces of theRoyal frog costume.The Gravedigger event also has access to abank deposit boxin the form of amausoleum.

Useful random events for Ironman players[edit|edit source]

In addition to the above, if playing onironman modeit is also recommended to do the following events, due to the difficulty to obtain certain rewards:

CerterandRick Turpentine: Short events which can reward acosmicornature talismanand even a small chance for ahalf of a key.Prison Pete: Rewards can include 6grimy toadflaxesor 4grimy snapdragonswhich would requireFarminglevel 38 and 62 to grow respectively.Dr Jekyllcan reward players with many specific potions. Notably, if the player is carrying a cleantorstol, he will offer astamina potion (4), which some Ironmen use for therevitalisation pool.

Random events with unique rewards[edit|edit source]

The following random events offer unique outfits or emotes:

Kiss the Frog: Always grants afrog tokenwhich can be used to buy an untradeablefrog maskorRoyal frog costume. Needs to be completed 2 times to unlock both pieces, though unlimited pieces can be obtained. Extra tokens may be traded in for an XP lamp at Thessalia's Fine Clothes in Varrock.Beekeeper: Needs to be completed 5 times to unlock allbeekeeper's outfitpieces. After the full set,flaxor coins are awarded instead. Also, alampis always awarded, even before the full set.Drill Demon: Needs to be completed 4 times to unlock all threecamouflage outfitpieces and unique emotes. After the full set, alampis awarded instead.Freaky Forester: Needs to be completed 3 times to unlock all threelederhosen outfitpieces. After the full set, alampis awarded instead.Gravedigger: Needs to be completed 5 times to unlock all fivezombie outfitpieces and unique emotes. After the full set, alampis awarded instead.Mime: Needs to be completed 7 times to unlock allmime outfitpieces and unique emotes. After the full set, alampis awarded instead.

2018 Random Event Update[edit|edit source]

As part of thePortal Nexus update, random events received another series of updates. According to Jagex, they believed many random events had outlived their practical use and were looking for a way to leave the nostalgia intact without disrupting the gameplay of both new players and those uninterested in the events. As such, certain events can now be left before completion. However, leaving an event early will not reward the player.

Furthermore, this update added additional changes:

Players will now automatically leave theMazeevent when the timer runs out.The walls of the Maze event no longer have options to click on, only the gates do.TheBeekeeperevent was removed from mobile. Players who were in the Beekeeper event on mobile when the update was released still had to finish it.The event returned to mobile at a later date, following a rework.The pheasants in theFreaky Foresterevent can still be attacked even if the player has their attack options hidden.This update may have also changed Freaky Forester to now accept anypheasantfor a reward, while still requesting a specific pheasant.The camera no longer sways in thePinballevent.The player can use any door to leave theSurprise Examevent.

The event returned to mobile at a later date, following a rework.

This update may have also changed Freaky Forester to now accept anypheasantfor a reward, while still requesting a specific pheasant.

Discontinued random events[edit|edit source]

Many random events were discontinued after theupdatethat made them optional. Some of the random eventNPCswere relocated to various locations aroundRuneScapeto preserve them in the game. The discontinued random events will be recorded here for historical purposes.

Equipment-damaging randoms[edit|edit source]

These random events would result in some sort ofequipmentmalfunction while the player was training askill. In these randoms, the graphic of thetree,rock, orfishing spotwould change to indicate that the player should not continue to use that resource. If the player did not stop using the resource within about 30 seconds, theirequipmentwould be damaged and players would have to fix it or find a replacement in order to continueskilling. The damaging event would stop after a few seconds, rendering the resource safe to harvest again.

Ent- The tree would grow an evil face and move slightly. If players did not stop cutting the tree, theiraxewould break, and they would need to take it toBobinLumbridgein order to have it repaired (for a small fee).Exploding Rock- The rock would begin to smoke. If players did not stopminingthat rock, theirpickaxewould break, and they would need to take it toNurmofin theDwarven Minesin order to have it repaired (for a small fee).Whirlpool- A whirlpool would appear on top of thefishing spot. If players did not stopfishingfrom that spot, theirsmall net/harpoon/etc. would be swallowed by the whirlpool and could not be retrieved. Players would need to find another fishing implement before they could fish again.

The following random events would displace, but not destroy, your equipment. These events were immediate and could not be avoided. Players could pick up the part that was thrown off of their equipment, reattach it in theirinventory, and resumeskilling. If players did not pick up their equipment quickly, though, they would risk other players picking up the piece once it was visible to them, or the piece would despawn after a short amount of time, leaving the player without the proper tool for their task.

Big fish- A large fish would appear and eat yourfishinggear, then would spit it out a few tiles away.Pickaxe handle/Pickaxe head- Whilemining, this random event would cause the head of yourpickaxeto fly off. Pick up the head and reattach it to the handle before it disappears.Axe handle (historical)/Axe head- Whilewoodcutting, this random event would cause the head of youraxeto fly off. Pick up the head and reattach it to the handle before it disappears.Spade handle/Spade head- Whilefarming, this random event would cause the head of yourspadeto fly off. Pick up the head and reattach it to the handle before it disappears.Rake handle/Rake head- Whilefarming, this random event would cause the head of yourraketo fly off. Pick up the head and reattach it to the handle before it disappears.

Guardians[edit|edit source]

Aggressiverandom events, known as guardians, used to appear when players were training gatherskills, which includedMining,Fishing,Woodcutting, andPrayer(buryingbones). Players could fight thesemonstersfor reducedcombatexperiencebut also for a chance at an item drop based upon the skill they weretraining. Theleveland max hit of the guardian that appeared was dependent upon the level of the player which they would attack, as follows:

The guardians were all removed from the game in the random event update, as their primary function was to kill players. However, for historical purposes the guardians were relocated to areas acrossRuneScape. Players may still kill them for their drops, but they are no longer considered aggressive. Their new locations are as follows:

Other dangerous or aggressive randoms[edit|edit source]

Candlelight- The player was teleported to a chapel with a strange monk wandering around. The player had to talk to the monk, Pious Pete, and ask him what was wrong. Pious Pete responded that his candles always go out when he lit them, so he needed the player's help to light them. He would then give the player a lighter. Once the player had the lighter, Pete told the player to light only the candles that are left standing, not the ones that are burnt down (he'd take care of those). There would be a screen with arrows to the left and the right, and a button in the middle. Once pressed, the player would light the candle (if it was an unlit candle). After all the candles were lit, the player would talk to Pious Pete and be teleported back to where they were with a small reward.Lost and Found(also known as the Abyssal network) - Triggered by playersteleportingusing aMagicspell. Players would be required to pull the "odd lever out" in order to continue with their teleport, after which they received onelaw runeand threeair runesto compensate them for their time.Lost Pirate- Cap'n Hand would mistake the player for one of his shipmates and talk to the player. If the player ignored him, he would attack the player with a crossbow. He would usually keep shooting the player until death. He was very accurate and hit almost every time even if the player was wearing high level armour. If a player tried to talk to him while he was in the process of attacking that player, he would stop attacking them and they would receive the reward from himPoison gas- A random event from Thieving chests. Occasionally, while looting a chest, gas would come out and damage nearby players. Despite the fact it had a green hit splat, the event would not inflictpoison.Strange box- Required the player to answer a question about the box to receive a reward before it replicated in their inventory. TheMysterious Old Mancan now be found in a house in easternFalador, forever trying to solve a strange box.Swarm (random event)- A very weak random that could not be hit; the only solution was to run away until it despawned. A harmless version of it can now be found on the docks ofPort Piscarilius.

Previously discontinued randoms[edit|edit source]

There are some random events that few people know about because they only ran for a short time, were very buggy, were taken out for balance reasons, or were unfinished and never released. These randoms were discontinued well before the 2014update.

Scrapped random events[edit|edit source]

Duke of Bridgelum[edit|edit source]

The Duke of Bridgelum was an unreleased random event that involved going to ScapeRune to help the Duke of Bridgelum reassemble dead cows from their component parts. The random event was scrapped because the testers at the time pointed out that the dismembered cow parts looked grotesque.

The reward would have been pieces of thecow outfit, which are now given to players as a reward frombirthday events.

Speedy Gnome[edit|edit source]

The Speedy Gnome, Sebastian Gno, was mentioned ina Behind the Scenes articleas being the "fastestgnomein the world", and was to be released alongside several other random events such as theSandwich lady. Judging by the statement in the article ("Don't ignore them!"), Sebastian Gno would have been one of those random events where anNPCappeared and tried to get the player's attention, like theDrunken Dwarf.

However, Sebastian Gno was not added to RuneScape along with the rest of the random events named, due to the race track in the random event being static and thus not an effective anti-bot feature at the time.

Locations without random events[edit|edit source]

Certain zones throughoutGielinorare designed so that players do not receive random events while in them. Traditionally, these zones were popular with players who wanted to trainskillsuninterrupted, such as players trainingMagicwithHigh Level Alchemy. However, this also made these areas susceptible tobots. These zones lost some of their advantages with the 2014 update that made random events optional.

The following zones are currently known to be free of random events:

Within the vicinity ofForestry eventsthat occurTheGolem workshopsection of theRuins of CamdozaalGrand Exchange, on the area with stone groundInside anybankwith a bank booth and in front of most bank chestsPlayer-owned housesinbuilding modeLake MolchOn theShayzien Agility CourseDeath's OfficeTheGoblin CaveMost minigames, such as:Blast Furnaceon the worlds with workersMastering MixologyMage Training Arena(while inside the minigame)Pest Control(while in the bank, during the activity, or waiting in the boats)Tithe Farm, in the farming areaTrouble Brewing(both inside the minigame and in the lobbies)TzHaar Fight CavePyramid PlunderVolcanic Mine, inside the mineStealing valuablesinside the thievable housesShooting Stars, in the vicinity of acrashed starMost bosses and combat areas, such as:Abyssal Nexus, near theAbyssal Sire's chambersAncient CavernApe Atoll(while thegreegreeis equipped)Crash Site CavernGod Wars DungeonPvP worldsRuins of TapoyauikWaterbirth Island DungeonWintertodt, inside the prison

Locations with fewer random events[edit|edit source]

Some random events are unable to spawn in some parts ofGielinor.

The following zones are currently known to have reduced random events:

Underwater- Only the Certers, Count Check, Genie, Dr Jekyll, Mysterious Old Man, and Rick Turpentine can spawn.Hunter areas- Random events that can teleport the player away do not spawn in the original Hunter areas.[20]

Bank locations with random events[edit|edit source]

Certainbanksallow for random events to spawn while the player is stood in-front of them. This can be useful for players wishing to utilise their bank to train skills such asMagicorFletching, while still getting random events. Note that because these locations are not treated as banks, certain items will not behave as expected, such as theReagent pouch'scontents not being usable when mixing potions.

The following locations have banks that are currently known to allow random events:

Rogues' DeninBurthorpe, which also has a nearby fire that can be used to trainCooking.The bank chest in theMyths' Guild.The bank chest by thecharcoal furnacesinHosidius.Ferox Enclavebank chest.The bank chest in theGiants' Foundry.Trouble Brewingbank chest.

Changes[edit|edit source]

Added XP lamps to the rewards from theBeekeeperrandom event.

TheCount Check random eventwas added to the game.TheMysterious Old Mancan now freely hand out items on members' worlds, including to players above the water's surface.Count Check,Dr Jekyll, and theGenieare now able to enter banks and will not despawn in banks.

Experiencelampsare now rewarded instead of 500 coins for players who have completed an event's outfit, and from the Quiz Master'smystery boxand Prison Pete.

Random events will no longer occur in range ofForestryevents.

Thesandwich ladynow has a 1/64 chance of giving astale baguettein place of abaguettewhen offered.

When completing random events, a message will tell you what rewards you received.

Many events can be left early. The Beekeeper event was removed from mobile. Additional changes are described in§ 2018 Random Event Update.

Random events will no longer trigger when in the Abyssal Sire or Cerberus chambers.

Random events no longer appear at theGrand Exchange.

A dismiss option is now available on random events.

Random events are now optional. Players may ignore random event until they disappear without the risk of being teleported or interrupted.

Random events that take you to another location should no longer occur in building mode, this doesn't include those that teleport you away for failing to complete the event.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

In the feast cutscene of theRecipe for Disasterquest, theDukegets thestrange boxrandom event, andEvil BobteleportsOsmanaway, which is probably a reference to how players find them annoying and interrupting.Some random events can appearunderwateronFossil Islandand in theMogre Camp; they will also wear adiving apparatusandfishbowl helmetas well as disappear with a surge of bubbles rather than the standard puff of smoke.When receiving a random event reward with a full inventory, the reward is dropped to the floor. It stays there for up to three hours before despawning, much longer than normal for a dropped item.[21]
