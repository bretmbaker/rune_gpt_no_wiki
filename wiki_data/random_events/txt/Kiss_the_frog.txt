[Page: Kiss the frog]

Kiss the frogis arandom event. The player must either kiss or pat the frog wearing the crown, who is really aprinceorprincess, in order to restore them to their true form. The newly transformed prince or princess will give you afrog tokenfor helping them, and this may be redeemed at theVarrockclothes shop to get afrog mask, aRoyal frog costume, or an experiencelamp.
Prior to random events being optional, ignoring them caused the player to be turned into a frog, and then sent to Frogland, where players must ask for forgiveness from the frog prince or princess. This would also happen if the player talked to the correct frog but refused to kiss them.
After random events became optional, you will no longer be teleported automatically for ignoring the event. Now the player must talk to theprinceorprincessthen refuse to kiss or pat them in order to be turned into a frog and sent to Frogland.
As a frog, a player only has 4 buttons available: Friend and Ignore list, Log out screen and music selection.
