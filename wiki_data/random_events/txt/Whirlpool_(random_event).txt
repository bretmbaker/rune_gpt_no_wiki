[Page: Whirlpool (random event)]

Thewhirlpoolis a discontinuedrandom event. Whilefishing, there was a chance of the players' fishing spot becoming a whirlpool. If the player continued to fish in the same spot, they would lose their fishing equipment. Like most random events, its purpose was to preventmacroing.

Attempting to fish withBarbarian Fishingcaused a dialogue box to come up saying "I'm not putting my hands in there."
