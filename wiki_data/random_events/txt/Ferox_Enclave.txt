[Page: Ferox Enclave]

Ferox Enclaveis the restored remains of a small town south-west ofCarrallanger(known today as theGraveyard of Shadows) that was once part of theZarosian Empire, abandoned and left to decay over the ages. It has recently been turned into a safe haven for travellers byFerox, an ex-Zamorakianacolyte who is searching for knowledge in order to learn about the history of theWilderness.
The town is a safe area within the Wilderness, meaning players cannotkill other playerswhile within the boundaries of the town. Due to the nature of theTele Blockspell, Ferox does not allow players who have had it cast on them to enter the town through the town'sbarriersuntil the spell has worn off, though players may still enter whilst in combat. Outside of the town by each entrance, there is a small area immediately outside where (under normal circumstances) players cannot be attacked. However, while you are teleblocked, PvP is fully enabled for you specifically. This means thateven if you are not teleblocked, other players whoareteleblockedcanattack you. Due to this currently existing exploit where teleblocked players can attack players in the area outside the Ferox Enclave,the 'safe zone' outside of the barrier should be treated as a full PvP zonefor the purpose of avoiding lures and scams.
The town is home toClan WarsandLast Man Standing, as well as portals toCastle WarsandDeath's Office. There is a chapel with analtarand thePool of Refreshmentwhich restores the player'shitpoints, stats,prayer points, andrun energy(but notspecial attackenergy).
Players who have paid Ferox5,000,000coins can set theirrespawn pointto Ferox Enclave, by the eastern barrier.
The level 13Wilderness obeliskis east of the Enclave. There are also a few safe methods of reaching Ferox Enclave that do not require players to traverse the Wilderness:
Ferox Enclave is home to refugees and travellers seeking sanctuary in the harsh climate of the Wilderness. As such, followers of various religions appear to tolerate each other's presence within Ferox Enclave; for example,Lisaand herwizardsareGuthixianfollowers,Andros MaiandSister ScarophiaareSaradoministfollowers, and theAcolytesareZamorakianfollowers.
In addition, the aesthetic of the buildings are of various religions as well; theClan Warsbuilding contains both Saradomin and Zamorak colours (blue/white and red/black carpets, suits of armour, and flags), theLast Man Standingcontains Guthixian colours (green flames and barriers), while the chapel's altar, dedicated toZaros, is maintained by Sister Scarophia, a Saradominist.
There are several features found within Ferox Enclave:
Abankerandbank chestcan be found on the western end. The bank is frequently used as a quick bank to a teleport location, in this case for the Ferox Enclave teleport option on thering of dueling. The bank is just a few tiles away from the stat and Prayer-restoring amenities, making it a great way for players to quickly restore everything except theirspecial attackand then re-gear for another trip.
There is also aloot chest, whichplayer-killersuse to cash inloot keysfrom players they killed.
Players can now consume blighted supplies while inside the Enclave.
