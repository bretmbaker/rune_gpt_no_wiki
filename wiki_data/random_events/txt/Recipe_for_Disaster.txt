The cook is preparing for a party inLumbridge. He tells the player that a hundred years ago, a very important meeting was held in Lumbridge. Supposedly his ancestor,Franizzard Van Lumbcook, cooked such an amazing banquet for the occasion that he was offered a job as head cook, along with all his descendants, for life.
This big, important meeting is held in Lumbridge every ten years and today is the 10th meeting. As he cannot think of a brilliant dish himself, he intends to use his ancestor's recipe for the feast. However, he needs help gathering the ingredients, again. Gather the ingredients and complete the subquest to receive an invitation to The Feast. All but therotten tomatocan be obtained from the Grand Exchange. You can buy one fromPelters' Veg Stallbehind theVarrock General Store, or head to the bank chest at the Emir's Arena inAl Kharidto obtain one from the barrel.
Items required:eye of newt,glass of greenman's ale,rotten tomatoanddirty blast ( fruit blast + ashes ).
Enter the doors to the dining room to begin the feast. The members of theLumbridgecouncil are gathered at the table:
Right before you enter, the Duke will get thestrange boxevent and will leave the room to fiddle with it, and Osman will get taken away byEvil Bob. At this point, you will enter the room. A short while later, theCulinaromancercrashes the party and starts to attack everyone at the dining table withmagicspells. Luckily, Aris will show up and freeze everyone in time (except the player and herself).
TheCulinaromancerarrives.
Arisarrives too late.
Aris casts "Tempus Cessit" to freeze the room in time.
Arisexplains that theCulinaromancerwas a cook in Lumbridge a hundred years ago and had threatened the secret council with death, only to be thwarted by the Duke's assistant, who managed to trap him in another dimension. This assistant was the cook's ancestor, and was made head cook for life.
The current head cook, whom you helped build the feast, apparently created a powerful food-magic, which released the Culinaromancer from his prison. Seeing him, Aris casts the aforementioned spell, so that you both can protect the council from the Culinaromancer's attacks. While she can easily seal the Culinaromancer in a heartbeat, due to the fact you caused the Culinaromancer to awaken she holds you responsible and sends you to save them as the magic is causing a temporal paradox that could destroy the known reality with the magic.
After the feast, you will be able to enter and exit the dining hall at will. However, the room will be in a dormant state. To release each member of the council from the Culinaromancer's spell, you must feed each of them their favourite food. Aris and Cook will both be there to help you. You can complete these subquests in any order, and start as many of them at a time as you want.
After you give each member their favourite dish, Aris teleports them away to safety and tells you how many more council members are left. Each subquest gives 1 quest point and some access to theCulinaromancer's Chest, as well as additional rewards such as items or lamps of experience.
After saving the final member of the Secret Council, the Culinaromancer will retreat through a portal back into his own dimension. Aris tells you to go through the portal to finish him off before he causes more trouble.
The safest way for anultimate ironmanto defeat the Culinaromancer is to suicide beforehand at the nettles in Edgeville and then only take the food and weapons that you require. After each fight you should repeat and restock on food at theWarriors' GuildandAlfonse the waiterin Brimhaven.
You can leave and stock up after defeating a boss without losing your progress. However, Prayer can never be used during any of the fights.
