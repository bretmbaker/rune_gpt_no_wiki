[Page: Ent (random event)]

Entswere aRuneScaperandom event. When a player tried to chop a tree, the tree had a chance of becoming anent, also known as a "dancing tree" to some players. Like most random events, its purpose was to stopmacrousers. Since the ent could appear for each player chopping the tree, the odds of it showing up increased whenwoodcuttingwith more players. However, once it appeared, it influenced all players chopping that tree.

If the character continued chopping at the ent, the woodcuttingaxebecame broken and useless. Once broken, a player could go toBob's Brilliant AxesinLumbridgeto get thebroken axefixed. Bob fixedbronze,iron, andsteel axesfree of charge, and other woodcutting axe types (mithriland above) for a small fee. The stronger the woodcutting axe, the higher the repair cost. Alternately, the axe could be repaired in aplayer-owned house, reducing the cost.

To warn players that the tree was an ent, in the "Choose option" box for that tree, the "chop down - " was in yellow instead of the usual light blue colour. Additionally, ents appeared as yellow dots on the mini-map.

To avoid losing their axe head one simply had to click to move away from the tree.

Trivia[edit|edit source]

Two ents could never be seen by players inOld School RuneScape; the dead tree in the Wilderness, as players cannot cut it down, and the Hosidius tree, which was unused ingame until the release ofGreat Kourend.The single canopyYoung treedoes not have an ent, as players could not access the tree when Ents were created. What would happen if players received the random event while cutting this tree is unknown.
