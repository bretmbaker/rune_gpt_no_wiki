[Page: Surprise Exam]

TheSurprise Examis arandom eventwhere the player is asked to answer a few questions. Theduncewill teleport the player to a classroom where the exam can be started.
Mr. Mordautwill ask the player two types of questions. One type requires the next object in a pattern to be found. In the second type, he will present fifteen cards and a hint. The goal is to discover three cards related to the hint displayed on the right. The player must then select the three related objects and confirm.
A useful strategy to make the exam slightly easier to complete, is to click to 'talk to'Mr. Mordautright after finishing a task, instead of clicking to continue in the chat box. Not clicking to continue in the chat box will cause the next question to be the exact same as the last one, albeit shuffled in positions. This means that if the question is 'What comes next in the pattern', the exact same item matching the pattern would need to be clicked for all three questions. This allows skipping the hint matching type of questions, and makes it easier to find the item required to complete the event. This technique persists across each occurrence of the random event and means that a chosen question can be kept forever if so desired.
If the exam is successfully completed, the player will be rewarded with abook of knowledgeafter leaving the classroom. Unlike thegenie'slamp, only one book of knowledge may be owned at a time. If a player already owns a book of knowledge, the player will receive an item instead. Possible rewards include an uncut gem, loop half of key, cosmic talisman or coins.
The event can be left before completion by exiting the classroom through anydoor, this however grants no rewards.
