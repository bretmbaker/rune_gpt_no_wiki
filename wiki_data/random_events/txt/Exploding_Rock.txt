[Page: Exploding Rock]

Theexploding rockrandom event(AKA: "smoking rock" or "gas") is aMiningrandom event that occasionally happens when a player tries to mine a rock after the point at which it begins to "steam/smoke/bubble". When this happens, the player should stop mining the affected rock immediately. After mining that rock for more than a few more seconds, the rock will explode which will break the player'spickaxe(seebroken pickaxe) making it unusable. It will also damage the player for a number ofHitpoints(based on the player's Hitpoints total) and it may even kill them if their Hitpoints were already greatly reduced.
Explosion of an exploding rock does not cease the smoke from puffing and therefore an exploding rock can explode again if it were mined again or mined by another player.
Pickaxes can be fixed byNurmofin theDwarven Mineand atBob's Brilliant Axesin southLumbridgeas well as at the battleaxe shop inPort Sarim. There is no charge forbronze,ironandsteel pickaxerepairs, but there is an escalating fee forpickaxesmade ofmithriland above. Note that only damaged pickaxes can be repaired - abrokenpickaxe that has a lost handle cannot be fixed by the NPCs. To remedy this situation, you must use thepickaxe handle(not to be confused with awood axe handle) on the pickaxe head to fix it.
This event served the purpose of discouragingmacroingby players inRuneScape, and was instituted as a preventative measure byJagex. It was one of the many counter-bot measures they had placed on activities that require long work, likeFishingandWoodcutting.
