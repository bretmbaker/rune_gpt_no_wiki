Treasure Trails/Guide/Anagrams
ttga
An anagram is a string of letters, which can be rearranged into another word or phrase. For example: orchestra is an anagram of carthorse .
The solution of an anagram is always the name of an NPC . Once the solution is found, the player can get their next clue by talking to that NPC. Often, when talking to an NPC, the player will receive a challenge scroll , puzzle box or light box that they must solve before receiving the next clue.
The anagrams in clue scrolls do not correspond with the number of spaces in a name; an anagram with no spaces may have an answer with a name corresponding with one or more spaces.
