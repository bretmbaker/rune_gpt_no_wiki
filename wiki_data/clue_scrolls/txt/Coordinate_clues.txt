Treasure Trails/Guide/Coordinates
ttgc
During a Treasure Trail , a coordinate clue is a clue scroll that contains a set of coordinates. Much like the real-world longitude and latitude geographic coordinate system , where angular coordinates correspond to your north-south and east-west position, coordinates in Old School RuneScape indicate a precise point somewhere on the surface where the next clue scroll, or potentially the treasure casket, is buried. Coordinates are presented in the following format:
03 degrees 00 minutes north/south 02 degrees 00 minutes east/west
In Old School RuneScape , one square of space is equivalent to 15/8 (1.875) minutes of arc. 0°00' degrees north and 0°00' degrees east is located in the middle of the Observatory .
Although a chart , sextant and watch may be used to determine one's present coordinates, players only need a spade in their inventory to dig up the clue.
On hard Treasure Trails, digging on the correct spot will cause a level 108 Saradomin wizard to appear, which must be defeated before the next clue scroll or the treasure casket may be dug up. If the coordinates are located in the Wilderness , a weaker level 65 Zamorak wizard will appear instead, which must also be defeated in order to dig up the next clue scroll or the treasure casket. Saradomin wizards are poisonous and use both Melee , using a Dragon dagger (p++) , and the Magic spell Saradomin Strike . It is advised to wear dragonhide armour and use the Protect from Melee prayer when fighting Saradomin wizards. Zamorak wizards use only the spell Flames of Zamorak . It is advised to use the Protect from Magic prayer when fighting the Zamorak wizard in the Wilderness, and to look out for player-killers , as other players can interrupt your fight.
On elite Treasure Trails, digging on the correct spot will cause either a level 97 Armadylean guard or a level 125 Bandosian guard to appear, which must be defeated before the next clue scroll or the treasure casket may be dug up. Armadylean guards must be killed with either Ranged or Magic attacks, since they are in the form of an Aviansie . It is advised to use the Protect from Missiles prayer when fighting them, and Protect from Melee when fighting Bandosian guards.
On master Treasure Trails, digging in the correct spot will cause either three Ancient Wizards (levels 112, 98, 98) in multi-combat to appear, or a level 140 Brassican Mage , which need to be defeated before the next clue scroll or the treasure casket may be dug up. If the coordinates are located in a multi-combat area , three Ancient wizards, each attacking with a unique attack style , will appear. Melee wizards are poisonous , with poison dealing 8 damage to a player. In single-combat zones, a Brassican Mage will appear, and its attacks cannot be stopped by protection prayers .
Following is a list of all known coordinate clues and their corresponding locations. The list is organised into ascending numerical value (for example, 00:00 north first, then 00:05 south, then 00:13 north, continuing accordingly). Shorthand writing is used together with normal writing. An example: 09°34'N, 25°12'E = 09 degrees and 34 minutes north, 25 degrees and 12 minutes east.
• Remember: You must have a spade with you to dig up coordinate clues.
Note that some of the clues may require skill or quest requirements before you will be able to get to that location.'
These quests, which must be finished or partially completed, include: Bone Voyage , Regicide , Legends' Quest , Nature Spirit , The Grand Tree , Fairytale II - Cure a Queen , Troll Stronghold , Cabin Fever , The Fremennik Trials , and Watchtower . Some coordinates will also require a certain skill levels to complete the clue, though the required level is low.

From Tyras Camp: go north past the dense forest, walk a few steps east and go south past the stick traps. Also can use fairy ring B J S and run north to Tyras Camp (requires 76 ).
From Lletya : go out of the city, past the trip wire, south over the leaf trap, past the Elf Tracker , west through the dense forest, over a second trip wire, north through another dense forest, then west and south past the stick trap.
08 degrees 05 minutes west

From Lletya : Pass the tree, go west across the tripwire, continue west through the dense forest. Turn north and up the path to Prifddinas . Before the bridge and the water, head west through the dense forest. Then, keep going west past the leaves pitfall trap, then south-west past a stick trap.
From Port Tyras : Go north through dense forest then east; go south through dense forest; step over tripwire; go east through the dense forest then north-west for quite a while; jump over the leaves. Finally, continue west till you arrive at an elven lamp next to mushrooms. Head south down the small path to the pond. Pass the stick trap and dig by the north-east edge of the pond.
This clue can be frustrating due to the frequency of activating the stick traps, which deal significant amounts of damage. There is a better success rate of passing the trap by turning off run and walking past the trap.

Changes [ edit | edit source ]
A hard level coordinate clue where the wrong type of wizard was spawning has now been fixed.
Coordinate clues no longer require a chart , watch , or sextant in the player's inventory or bank in order to complete.
Trivia [ edit | edit source ]
Assuming Gielinor is canonically on an Earth-sized planet, the continent's width (from the west shore of Lunar Isle to the east shore of Mos Le'Harmless ) is approximately 56° 10' 12" (6,234 km or 3,874 miles). The continent's length from the north tip of the Iceberg to the south shore of the Pest Control Island is approximately 47° 48' 00" (5,285 km or 3,284 miles).

Mod Ash: "Looks intentional - the dev specifically added something to wipe your payment status when you jump back, and it strains credibility that he typed it by accident." In response to the tweet: "Is the Ogre in Gu'tanoth supposed to charge you 20gp every time you jump over the bridge? I've had to pay a few times doing clue steps and I'm not sure if it's a bug or not. I noticed RS3 had this patched on Aug 19 2019."
