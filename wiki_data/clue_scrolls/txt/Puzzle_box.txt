Puzzle box
Puzzle boxes can be obtained by doing clue scrolls . Before you are able to continue with your clue scroll, you will have to complete the puzzle.
A puzzle box is always scrambled 101 times before being handed to the player, by randomly sliding a piece into the empty position starting from the solved state.
If you have a duplicate puzzle box, (obtained by a method such as the Drop trick ) in your inventory or bank after completing the clue, you cannot obtain another clue.

Changes [ edit | edit source ]
The colour of the Theatre of Blood master clue sliding puzzle background is now easier to differentiate from the sliding pieces.
The item was renamed from "Puzzle box" to "Puzzle box (difficulty)".
