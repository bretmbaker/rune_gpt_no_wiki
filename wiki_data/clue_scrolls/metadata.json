However, in others it may not be so easy. For example - in the clue \"ZCZL\", \"e\" is not the key as that returns the answer \"EHEQ\". While it is possible it is doubly encrypted, we should explore other alternate keys instead. The next port of call if \"e\" is not the key is to use vowels, namely \"A, E, I, O, U and Y\" - as every word in English contains at least one of those letters. If we try using \"A\" as the key to the cipher, we get \"Adam\" - which is correct. However, if this was not the case - you should work your way through all vowels.

Once the emote has been performed, Uri will appear and give the player the next clue (or the reward, if the emote clue was the final step of the Treasure Trail). If the player has been requested to do another emote before talking to Uri, and they forgot to do it, he will say, I don't believe we have any business... but will not leave. The player can still perform the second emote and then talk to Uri to finish the clue. Easy clues require performing one emote, medium clues require performing two, and hard and above clues require performing one emote, then fighting an enemy such as the Double Agent . Elite clues do not involve fighting the Double Agent .",
