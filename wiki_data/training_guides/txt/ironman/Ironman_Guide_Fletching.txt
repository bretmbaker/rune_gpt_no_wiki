Ironman Guide

The Fletching skill is most often trained by ironmen while working on other skills, as the ability to purchase all ingredients, as well as their stackability, makes them easy to bring to different training locations. Common skills Fletching is trained alongside are Runecraft , Agility , and Farming . Players also train Fletching while completing quests .

Fletching is also used for making high-level darts and arrows for use in Ranged combat. It can also be useful as a source of mid-tier Ranged armour or weaponry, depending on the player's Fletching level. Players looking to train Slayer will need large amounts of arrows if they plan to use Ranged in combat.
