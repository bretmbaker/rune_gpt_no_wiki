Ironman Guide

Agility training on an ironman is not very different from training it on a regular account. A variety of agility courses can be used, with the majority of them requiring little to no inventory or equipment considerations. As a skill, Agility is very useful to train for its passive energy restoration effect, which speeds up many training methods, quest completion, and travel around the world in general. Agility also provides access to the graceful outfit , one of the best all-around equipment sets for almost any non-combat situation. Because Agility has very few inventory requirements to train, it is a good skill to train in tandem with other skills that use the inventory space, such as Magic or Fletching .

Ultimate Ironmen may find it difficult to fully take advantage of the Hallowed Sepulchre , though given how important the Ring of endurance is to run energy management it is recommended to always loot the Grand Hallowed Coffin .
