Ironman Guide

Herblore is arguably the hardest skill to train on an ironman since collecting the herbs and most of the secondary ingredients can be slow and time-consuming. Therefore, it is advised to put the rewards of every experience lamp and book of knowledge into Herblore if possible. By the time all hard diaries are completed, if making all potions obtained along the way, the player should have around level 67â€“69 Herblore, just enough to start boosting to make ranging potions.
