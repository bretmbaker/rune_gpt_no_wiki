Ironman Guide

Fishing is most often trained through "powerfishing", where the caught fish are dropped rather than banked. While the skill is classically a good source of food for combat training, the required time investment to catch and cook fish makes it less useful for Ironman players when compared to buyable food (such as cooked karambwans , jugs of wine , and potatoes with cheese ) or Saradomin brews . At high Fishing levels, it is possible to get large amounts of raw sharks from fishing minnows , which can be a solid food choice once cooked.
