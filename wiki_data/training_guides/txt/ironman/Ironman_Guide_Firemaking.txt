Ironman Guide

Firemaking is a skill commonly trained first by ironmen, almost entirely through Wintertodt . Due to the benefit of having a low Hitpoints level when subduing Wintertodt, it is a common first objective to level Woodcutting and Firemaking to 50 before any other skills. Whilst this has traditionally been a common first objective, the introduction of a warmth meter in October 2024 meant subduing the Wintertodt is no longer hampered by a higher Hitpoints level.

Most of the logs obtained through Woodcutting or otherwise are commonly used in birdhouse trapping , leaving few logs for Firemaking training, making Wintertodt even more ideal.
