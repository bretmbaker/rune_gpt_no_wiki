Ironman Guide

Hunter is a skill that is commonly trained mostly as normal , however, an emphasis is placed on gathering ingredients for Herblore and Ranged , with bird house trapping , Herbiboar and hunter rumours all providing useful resources.

At higher levels, ironmen will often hunt chinchompas to aid in ranged training .

Quests and achievement diaries are strongly recommended or required to access several hunter training methods.

Eagles' Peak (requires 27 ) is needed to unlock box traps , the only way to hunt chinchompas Bone Voyage for access to bird house trapping and Herbiboar Children of the Sun for access to the Hunters' Guild and At First Light (requires 46 ) for access to Master Tier Hunter Rumours Song of the Elves or the hard Western Provinces Diary for the best spots to hunt carnivorous chinchompas

Additionally, higher crafting and woodcutting levels for higher tier bird houses is strongly recommended, and loot from Herbiboar and hunter loot sacks scales with levels in other skills.

Good teleportation options such as fairy rings and higher agility levels for better run restoration may also be helpful when training Hunter.
