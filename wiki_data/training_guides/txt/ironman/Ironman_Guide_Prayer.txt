Ironman Guide

Prayer is a slower skill to train for ironmen due to having to obtain bones themselves. Ideally, it is best to use every bone on an experience boosting altar, such as the Chaos Altar , Ectofuntus , Libation bowl , or with high Construction , a gilded altar in the chapel of your player-owned house . A bone crusher or ash sanctifier can be used for passive experience while training when the bones dropped are not worth picking up.

Early Prayer goals include level 43 for Protect from Magic , Protect from Missiles and Protect from Melee , and level 45 for all stat-boosting prayers up to Mystic Might .

Later goals include level 70 for Piety , and level 85 for the Elite Desert Diary .
