Training Mining on an ironman is not very different from training it normally . In addition to the normal training methods, players will need to mine volcanic ash for making ultracompost and gem rocks for making expeditious bracelets at some point.

Pickaxes up to rune can be bought from Nurmof's Pickaxe Shop . A dragon pickaxe can only be obtained as a rare drop from Artio , Chaos Elemental , Callisto , Calvar'ion , Kalphite Queen , Spindel , Venenatis and Vet'ion , or as a very rare drop from King Black Dragon . A broken dragon pickaxe is a 1% chance to drop from an ore pack bought from Petrified Pete's Ore Shop at the Volcanic Mine for 4000 points. It must be repaired by taking it to Nurmof in the Dwarven Mine for a fee of 2,500,000 coins.
