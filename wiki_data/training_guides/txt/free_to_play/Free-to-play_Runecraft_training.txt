When crafting runes at a runic altar , it is a good idea to wear the corresponding tiara in your head slot . This acts as an equipable talisman , saving an inventory space over a normal talisman. It also allows the player to enter a particular runic altar by left-clicking on the corresponding mysterious ruins, as opposed to having to use the talisman on them, thereby saving time. Talisman tiaras may be purchased from the Grand Exchange , from other players, or crafted by a player themselves. To create a talisman tiara, the player must have a plain tiara and the corresponding talisman in their inventory , and use the tiara on the altar of that particular talisman. For example, a player who wishes to create an air tiara must enter the Air Altar ruins, and use the tiara on the altar with an air talisman in their inventory. The talisman itself is lost in the process.

All runes craftable by free-to-play RuneScape players may be crafted from either rune essence , pure essence or Runecrafting cores . Body cores give the most experience, but they are very hard to obtain in large quantities. To obtain enough, one needs to spend most of their combat training by killing Body Golems .

For rune or pure essence, using one over the other makes no difference to experience gained or the number of runes crafted per essence. It is therefore recommended to use the cheaper option, which is pure essence ( 1 each) rather than rune essence ( 12 each). As a free-to-play player, you will not be able to mine your own pure essence, but you can still purchase it through the Grand Exchange or from other players directly.

Note that energy potions ( 77.25 per dose) restore 10% run energy with each dose, and using them either at the bank or while running greatly increases experience gained from all of the below methods by 30â€“50% over just letting your run energy recharge normally (the actual percent experience per hour gained depending on the method and your Agility level).
