This guide outlines the best methods for training the Woodcutting skill in free-to-play .

To optimise your Woodcutting experience gained, it's usually fastest to drop your logs instead of banking, both in terms of time saved not travelling to the bank but also time saved by not having to compete for resources, as Woodcutting locations far away from banks are usually empty. This depends on your ability to quickly drop an entire inventory of logs versus the travel time to and from the nearest bank. Some players may find that when cutting willow trees for example, with the very close willows to the bank in Draynor Village , it may be faster and less stressful to bank the logs instead of dropping them.

Training Firemaking alongside Woodcutting may be an appealing choice depending on your situation. For players with a Firemaking level below 45, it's usually an efficient use of your time to burn cut logs; however, once you reach a Firemaking level of 45, it is more time efficient to drop/bank your low-level logs from training Woodcutting and use the saved time to build up money for maple logs or yew logs instead.
