Slayer is a skill that allows players to kill monsters that may otherwise be immune to damage. Players must visit a Slayer Master , who will assign them a task to kill certain monsters. Slayer experience is roughly equal to a slain monster's Hitpoints and is awarded each time the player kills an assigned monster.

This guide focuses on the fastest ways to train Slayer. While there are no real requirements to begin Slayer training, it is strongly recommended to have fairly high combat stats and to have completed many quests . This enables the ability to block more undesired Slayer assignments (known as "block slots," which are applied using the " block task " option for 100 Slayer points , and have quest point requirements). High combat stats increase damage output considerably and allow the player to use the best equipment available. Having a higher combat level also gives access to better Slayer Masters, as the low-level Slayer Masters have worse task lists and give fewer Slayer reward points than the higher-level ones. Alternatively, players may choose to train combat stats while in the process of training Slayer.

When slaying for the best experience rates, players will generally barrage multiple Slayer monsters at once for the majority of the experience and use melee with the dwarf multicannon when barraging is not viable. Follow a task list that offers the fastest Slayer experience per hour, and use Slayer reward points to skip undesirable tasks as often as possible. However, some players may find that alternative priorities suit them best, as Slayer also has the potential to be a highly profitable skill.

Slayer also provides a lot of passive experience in combat skills. Because of the bonuses given by the Slayer helmet (i) , it offers some of the best rates of melee combat experience in the game.
