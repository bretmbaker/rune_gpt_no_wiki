Herblore training usually involves making potions which can only begin after completing the Druidic Ritual quest granting the player level 3 Herblore. To make a potion, the player will have to gather the required ingredients, usually a herb of some sort along with a secondary ingredient, and use them on a vial of water , blood , or coconut milk .

The fastest way to train Herblore is to add secondary ingredients to unfinished potions. If the player banks fairly quickly after each inventory of potions, they can expect to make around 2,500 potions per hour.

A profitable, although slow method to train Herblore is to clean grimy herbs.
