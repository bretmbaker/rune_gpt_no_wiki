Training Prayer can be quite costly, but it is a very important skill due to its utility in combat.

Many quests recommend having 43 Prayer, as this allows a player to use all available protection prayers. Other important milestones include Level 50 for completing all quests, Level 77 for unlocking all prayers and Level 85 for completing all Achievement Diaries . Having a higher Prayer level also allows the player to restore more prayer points per prayer potion / super restore / sanfew serum dose.
