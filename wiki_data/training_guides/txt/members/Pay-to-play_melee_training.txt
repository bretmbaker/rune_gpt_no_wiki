This article provides information about effective ways to train Attack , Strength , Defence , and Hitpoints through melee combat .

This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is Levels 20 to 30 , you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more food or use food that heals more.
