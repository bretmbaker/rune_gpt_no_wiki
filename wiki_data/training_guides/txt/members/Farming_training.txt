Farming training focuses heavily on doing tree runs , which is a recurring training method. Much like daily events and recurring money making methods , tree runs give Farming experience passively over time since it is possible to only do 1 or 2 runs per day. Instead of actively training the skill for hours, players only spend a few minutes to do a run, gaining a lot of Farming experience during that short amount of time, and then do other activities while waiting for the patches to grow. While trees take a very long while to grow in real time, players spend very little time actively doing tree runs.

Doing tree runs costs money, and certain saplings and protection payments can be quite expensive. It is recommended to have a decent amount of money to be able to buy a lot of Farming supplies at once, and have a good money making method to sustain the cost of doing tree runs. Herb runs are often highly profitable and they also offer a fair amount of Farming experience, but usually it is better to look into money making alternatives that offer better profit.
