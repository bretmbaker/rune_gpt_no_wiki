Construction is one of the most expensive skills to train in Old School RuneScape . It is recommended to have a lot of spare coins to buy a large number of planks from the Grand Exchange beforehand, so players will not have to constantly buy more supplies whenever they run out.

To start off, purchase a player-owned house from any estate agent for 1,000 . Alternatively, complete the Daddy's Home miniquest , which gives a home as one of its rewards, as well as a crate of Construction supplies and enough experience to reach level 8. A players' house portal is located in Rimmington by default, but can be moved later to one of 8 different locations for a fee. The house will have two rooms; a parlour and a garden ; apart from the exit portal in the garden, there is nothing built for the player.

Players will need a saw and a hammer to build items . It is recommended to have level 40 Magic to be able to cast Teleport to House . Alternatively, use teleport to house tablets .
