Agility training involves a lot of point-clicking and some methods may require a lot of focus to maximise experience gain. Higher Agility level increases one's ability to regenerate run energy and grants access to various shortcuts .

For the fastest rates, players should always run and use stamina potions (or some other form of run energy restoration) to maintain run energy if needed. Keeping weight at 0 or below is helpful, but not necessary. It is recommended to boost the Agility level by using summer pies or agility potions to train on a higher-level course earlier than it is available. Players who are failing obstacles very frequently or have low Hitpoints are advised to bring some food to restore health.
